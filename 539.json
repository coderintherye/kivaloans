She is 18 years old and she is a preschool teacher. \r\n\r\nThis loan has been invested in the purchase of chickens to later sell as meat (butchered). She has two years in the business and it has been successful. She has been contributing to the household finances, although she also has her husband\u2019s support. He is an agriculturist. \r\n\r\nThe reason she took up a business is to earn her own money and to be able to provide for the expenses generated by the home. She also wants to make her loan payments on time. \r\n\r\nThe earnings that she perceives are invested in the purchase of soft drinks. The loan she requested is also invested in this loan. She mentions that both businesses are doing well. \r\n\r\nHer major goal is to have enough money to support herself and her husband in their old age, to have a source of income form where to have whatever they need for whatever time God grants them. She also wants to see her daughter finish studying for a career. \r\n\r\nThe group's name is Sahuara and they chose the name for a spiny plant by that name. They thought it was a good idea. Four women formed the group and they each have a different business. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are as follows: \r\n\r\nZoraida L.

Since the store\u2019s founding in 2006, Lower Haters has developed a dedicated following of artists, designers, friends, and fans.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nMarketing and finding new customers is Lower Haters\u2019 biggest challenge, according to Janice, but once people have visited they usually come back. All of the items found in Lower Haters are designed by local artists, so \u201cpeople feel connected to every piece in here. The artists often stop by the store, and we end up becoming a big family.\u201d\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nJanice and Corey further foster that sense of community by actively participating in the neighborhood merchant\u2019s association, the Lower Haight Art Walk, and by transforming Lower Haters once a month for their late-night art receptions. In addition, they have begun hosting trunk shows where vendors are able to set up their own booths right in the shop, and interact directly with their customers.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nJanice and Corey now want to add silk-screening to the list of services that they can offer. Up-and-coming artists, who may not be able to afford the higher cost of small run printing services offered by other companies, will be able to bring their designs to print at Lower Haters. Printed t-shirts will be sold directly in the store, or made for concerts and other promotional events.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nBut despite Lower Haters\u2019 success and the new business that silk-screening will attract, Janice and Corey were unable to secure a small business loan from a traditional bank. With a $5,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, their local microlender, Janice and Corey will be able to purchase a used silkscreen machine and begin operating it at their store. They are excited about the collaborations this new equipment will allow them to pursue.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo find out more about Lower Haters and shop online,

She sells an assortment of goods which includes eggs, cereals, chicken feed and kerosene. She has been in this business for seven years now and has managed to provide employment to two people. She says that this business is profitable.\r\n\r\nThe only major challenge she has is the transportation of cereals, since they are bulky. Oil prices, too, fluctuate a lot, sometimes leading to people not buying when prices are high, thus causing slow movement of her stock. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well.\r\n\r\nShe is using her loan of 40,000 KES to buy more cereals to grow her business and meet the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to buy a plot of land to build on. She also hopes to give her children a good education to the university level. She describes herself as humble and hardworking."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":498.62,"image":{"id":705159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

M. is a married man. His wife is a teacher and they have two children, aged eleven years old and eight years old. Cyrus owns a general store in which he sells different items including school bags, sweets, sodas and many other items. His business is located near the busy Jogoo Road where he finds customers easily.\r\n\r\n He has been in this business for nineteen years now and has managed to provide employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is harassment from corrupt local authorities.

He operates an electronics shop as a primary business and at the same time, he manages a motorcycle transport business locally known as \u2018Boda boda\u2018 in the Kiserian market. This market is very busy, thus many customers.  He has been in this business for six months with a good income.\r\n\r\nHe was introduced to KADET LTD by an existing member of KADET, and he is applying for his first loan of KES. 80,000, which he

She has been farming since she was a young girl.  Today she relies on it as her main source of financial income.  The primary crops that she grows are potatoes and corn.  In addition, she has a stable where she raises sheep, pigs, and guinea pigs.  Janeth cares for the animals and every so often sells them at the local livestock fair.  This activity generates more income than farming and it gives her something to do while she waits for her harvest.  However, most of her time is intensely devoted to farming.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Janeth is very happy to know that she has a source of financial support, so she always shows that she is responsible with her payments.

After Alejandro and his family decided they wanted to purchase the business, they approached the store\u2019s former owners with an offer contingent upon financing.  Alejandro needed this financing quickly, before the owners moved on to other interested buyers.  With a loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana, they were able to purchase the store, including the store\u2019s equipment and remaining inventory.\r\n\r\nPi\u00f1ata Land is a true family-owned and operated business, consisting of Alejandro, his wife, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law.  Alejandro\u2019s wife and sister-in-law run the storefront and day-to-day operations, while Alejandro and his brother-in-law balance full-time jobs with managing Pi\u00f1ata Land finances.  Alejandro and his wife handle all of this in addition to raising two small children (ages 3 and 4).

They are in high school and primary school. Her husband is a taxi driver. \r\n\r\nShe sells all types of clothing and bed sheets. She sells door to door and she travels to the rural regions to sell her products. She works every day except Saturdays. She completes her sales on credit but they must pay in full in two payments, either every two weeks or per month.   She buys her merchandise in Chone. She has a few years in the business and it has been very successful. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase pants, blouses, t-shirts, undergarments and bed sheets. She has been through 38 loan cycles with her communal bank and she is the treasurer of the group.  She enjoys partaking because through these loans she is able to finance her business.  Her dream is to have a store of her own."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":705641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

C. is a married woman who lives in Aguinaldo, Calubang, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband, Hernany, who is 57 years old, works as a Barangay Tanod (village policeman) to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 19 and 31 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $233, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children\u2019s education and house expansion. Florita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

B. is from the village of Panalsalan.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nRheza is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 11th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 45-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: the buying and selling of Nipa (palm fronds woven into roof materials) and a general store business. She lives in Purok Bugnay, Barangay Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her buying and selling of Nipa and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $114. \r\n\r\nJocel is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can purchase more materials.  This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

E. is a married woman who lives in Purok 4, Brgy. Tuyom, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a rice mill and a sugarcane plantation. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Lauro, who is 51 years old, manages the sugarcane field to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n\r\nThey have two children who are 19 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nJudith joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Judith has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use as funds in her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future household and family expenses. \r\n\r\nJudith E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

V. is from the village of Danao. She is 56 years old. Catalina is married and has six adult children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Catalina owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Catalina has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Catalina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Catalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. \r\n\r\nCatalina is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Catalina from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Juanita is married and has two adult children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Juanita owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Juanita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Juanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. \r\n\r\nJuanita is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Juanita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 28 years old. Susette is married and has two school-aged children. \n\nTo make a living, Susette owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing repair services to local community members. Susette has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Susette joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Susette has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to provide service. Susette is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Susette from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

P. is from the village of Puntod Lopez Jaena. She is 40 years old. Lourdes is married and has five school-age children. To make a living, Lourdes owns and operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing and selling generally manufactured products to local businesses and community members. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Lourdes joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 17th loan taken out by Lourdes from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

M. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 37 years old. Elsie is married and has four school-age children. To make a living, Elsie owns and operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice to sell. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Elsie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to pay for services to increase crop yield. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Elsie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support members of her immediate family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is married and lives in Prk. Bugnay, Brgy. Vsta Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by buying and selling nipa, a type of palm leaf which is used in homes and to make items such as baskets. Her husband Josue B., who is 52 years old, works as caretaker of a fish pond and also helps in his wife in her business activities. They have two children who are 18 and 21 years old. The older one is married while the younger is still in school. Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she wanted a better for her family. With the help of her 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She has applied for a new loan to buy more nipa to sell, and hopes to generate enough income to help her younger child complete school. Merlinda B. following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

S. is 48 years old, married and supports her family by selling nipa, a type of palm leaf which is used in homes and in making items such as baskets. She lives in Prk. Orcaides, Brgy. Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental, where she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004. She has used her membership to improve her family's living conditions through hard work and by making good use of loans from NWTF. Evelyn is slowly succeeding in making her family more economically stable, and now earns 1,000 PHP a month. She is applying for a new loan, her 12th, for PHP 29,500 to buy more nipa to sell to her customers.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is from the village of Looc Proper. She is 33 years old. Mae is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mae owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector, selling personal products. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal products to tourists and local community members. Mae has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mae joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mae has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Mae is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Mae from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a married woman who lives in La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (variety) store and pig fattening. Her husband Ignacio G., who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 25 and 38 years old; all of her children have their own family now. \r\n\r\nRosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Anelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\n<p>For her 17th loan, Anelita is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more tailoring materials in order to save up for future food and education. Anelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 55-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a business buying and selling rice. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,200. \r\n\r\n<p>Erlinda is borrowing PHP 12,000 in order to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Erlinda hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Besides farming, he is a fisherman and he owns a mill where he is able to earn some profit to support his family.  \r\n\r\nIn the past, he wanted to breed a cow, but he did not have enough money to buy one.  In order to do that, Mr. Oem M. is seeking a loan to buy a cow for breeding so he can start a new business.

is a widow who lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a Natasha dealer business. She has 4 children who are between 27 and 38 years old.  All of her children are married. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nErlinda's previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6400, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses. Erlinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

That is why this adventurous member of the Dogon tribe began work as a caretaker and, with his earnings, took the initiative to enter into money-making ventures.  He has been selling beverages at a cultural center in Koutiala for three years.  The work he does is very profitable because he sells many cases of drinks per day. \r\nIn order to increase his working capital, Mr. T. has partnered with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for two years.

He sells them for cash at the cultural center in Koutiala to a clientele of men and women.
