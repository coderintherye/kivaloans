This will enable her to increase her production and to meet her customer expectations better.     \r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>    \r\n\r\nN\u00e9e en 1963, Madame A.

Because of this, they exert double the effort to earn sufficient income to permit them to pay for the education of their children.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Christian Garcia, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 \u201cJetypeka\u201d tiene 6 meses de formaci\u00f3n mantiene a la mayor\u00eda de las primeras integrantes aun trabajando con el grupo, pasan al 2\u00ba ciclo con capacitaci\u00f3n realizada y un ahorro acumulado de Gs.714.527; su trabajo y dedicaci\u00f3n son las bases mas fuertes de este grupo de mujeres emprendedoras.<p>\r\n\r\n Las se\u00f1oras que componen este grupo se dedican a diversas actividades productivas, ellas utilizan el pr\u00e9stamo como capital operativo comprando mas mercader\u00edas en algunos casos o insumos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de productos en el caso de las se\u00f1oras que se dedican a la venta de comestibles.<p>  \r\n\r\nEntre las actividades que realizan podemos citar: venta de cosm\u00e9ticos (cremas, maquillajes, colonias), venta de ropas, venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas, venta de chipas (comida t\u00edpica paraguaya,), despensa, lavanderas (lavan ropas).<p>\r\n\r\nEstas mujeres anhelan un futuro mejor para sus hijos, por eso se esfuerzan el doble para generar suficiente ingresos que les  permita pagar los estudios de sus hijos.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":119487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of fruits, vegetables, clothing, cosmetics, cheese, meats, canned goods and a washer <p>\r\nCompra de frutas, verduras, ropas, cosmeticos, queso, carne, productos enlatados y un lavarropas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Asunci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-01-27T23:45:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ceferiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crecencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pabla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-11T19:28:07Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":7000000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":508.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":508.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":508.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":509,"local_amount":2336393.44,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2361327.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143844,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":509,"local_amount":2336393.44,"processed_date":"2008-03-28T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2361327.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167954,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":507,"local_amount":2327213.11,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2352049.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193835,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-28T19:28:07Z","paid_date":"2008-04-28T09:05:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":33200,"name":"Gregoria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Gregoria lives in the district of Laureles Norte in Managua.

For example, Yovana raises and slaughters cattle.  With her loan from the community bank she has been able to purchase more young cattle and later receive more profits.  \r\nAnother example is Felicitas, who sells clothing at various markets in the region.  When she started she was only able to sell a few items, but with an increase in capital she is able to offer a much larger selection.<p>\r\nDifferent associates need different loans, most are for 300, 600, 900 soles (3 soles = $1) making a total of 9,300 soles.

Meeting monthly on the hospital grounds, they share their experiences and problems in the field and try to find solutions. They are being helped by the Runyenjes Hospital staff that has provided information about family planning issues and also supplied them with contraceptives. Other partners of the Runyenjes group include the Ministry of Health and numerous other organizations, such as the Chogoria Hospital CBD. In 2001, Kisumu Medical & Education Trust sponsored updates and trainings on a number of key issues, including family planning, the Community Based Abortion Care Project (COBAC), as well as first-aid and home-based care. KMET have been supplying the group with contraceptives as well as Nutriflour which they distribute to the community. The community truly appreciates the services KMET is offering through their partnerships. KMET has also empowered the group's members through its loans. Consequently, Runyenjes group's members have improved their living standards and health status as well as the severity of poverty in the community. The members are motivated and have been able to reach more clients with family planning services. The area where the group provides its services is agriculturally rich, and the main economic activity and source of income is farming. It is the case also for the members of Runyenjes group - 90% of them grow various crops ranging from tea and coffee, to maize and bananas. The produce, especially bananas grown in large amounts, is transported to Nairobi, 200 km away. A lot of money is spent on hiring a truck to transport the produce to the market for sale. The Runyenjes group is therefore asking for a loan of US$5,000 to help them pay for part of the distribution van cost so as to make product distribution easier and less costly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":119786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase

Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. \"Who or what are kuku?\" you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals or prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":119857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. \"Who or what are kuku?\" you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals or prettier?), but this is all time and space will

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

Senora Walbina sells clothing for women and children along a busy road between Asuncion and the city of Fernando de la Mora.  Many people wait for the bus along this route and all the main bus lines pass by.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walbina starts very early each day, starting her one hour journey to work around 5am.  She exhibits her products from two wooden tables along the road.   One of her goals is to be able to rent a place for her business. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She tells us she began her business selling a few accessories for little girls, such as bracelets, hair clips, etc, but as time passed she was able to expand the variety of merchandise thanks to her successful sales.  Today, she also travels once a month to Argentina, the neighboring country, to sell typical products such as table clothes, hammocks and other handicrafts.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walbina is a hardworking woman who would like to grow her business.  She is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise to sell, such as shorts, pants, hats, blouses, skirts, and various handicrafts. <\/p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Walbina vende ropas para damas y ni\u00f1os debajo del viaducto que esta ubicado en una zona de mucho movimiento, ya que este viaducto une dos ciudades grandes Asunci\u00f3n (capital) y la Ciudad de Fernando de la Mora. En este punto mucha gente espera el autob\u00fas pues las principales l\u00edneas de buses pasan por ah\u00ed. <p>\r\n\r\nTodos los d\u00edas, Walbina empieza su d\u00eda muy temprano, alrededor de las cinco de la ma\u00f1ana ella emprende su viaje hasta su puesto de trabajo, ya que ella vive en la ciudad de Capiat\u00e1 que queda a una hora de viaje. Ella exhibe sus productos en dos mesas de madera y desea en el futuro poder alquilar un local para su negocio.<p>\r\n\r\nElla nos cuenta que empez\u00f3 con un capital peque\u00f1o vendiendo algunos accesorios para ni\u00f1as como pulseras, binchas para el pelo, remeras, gomas para el pelo, pero con el tiempo fue ampliando su variedad de mercader\u00edas gracias al \u00e9xito que tuvo con las ventas. Hoy d\u00eda, adem\u00e1s de su puesto de ventas, ella viaja una vez al mes al vecino pa\u00eds, Argentina, para vender productos t\u00edpicos como manteles, hamacas, entre otras artesan\u00edas.<p>\r\nWalbina es una mujer emprendedora que desea seguir expandiendo su negocio, ella solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00edas para la venta tales como: remeras, shorts, pantalones, gorros, camisas, faldas, bermudas, manteles, hamacas, artesan\u00edas, etc.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

The work is hard but interesting and takes a lot of effort. With the help of her husband, who is pictured, she purchases calves, breeds them, and cuts and sells them to the butcher at the local big market. Her current income is not enough to cover all of her family's expenses. To increase the business's profit margin, Zuleykha has to invest some money to increase the size of her small herd. This Winter she applied for a $1,000 loan to help her purchase five calves and she hopes that the calves will be worth twice as much in six months.

In 2006 Telma established a soft drink and snack food caf\u00e9 business, and now requires a loan of $350 in order to purchase modern cooking equipment and utensils, which will enable her to produce and sell more food.\r\n\r\n<p>It is said that Coca Cola is one of the most recognized symbols or \u2018words\u2019 in the world. And it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of beverage stand selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness. (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the sticks, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on it!) The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing--heat is a very cheap marketing tool! All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":119943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To

In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. \"Who or what are kuku?\" you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals or prettier?), but this is all time and space will

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":119959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

F. is a married lady with two daughters, who in addition to helping her in her business also study at secondary school. Her business is the sale of food. She has had experience in this since she was a young girl, as previously she worked helping a woman in the same line of business. She began selling food when her husband lost his job and she noticed that the family really needed money. Her husband stopped working when their children were still small, so she decided to begin selling food. At first she sold it from her house, but with time she says she realized that she would sell more if her business was in a location where there was a higher volume of people, so for that reason she decided to move her business to the municipal market.<p>\r\nOne of Maria\u00b4s needs is that because of scarce resources she does not have enough to buy food ingredients, and for that reason she has worked with CEPRODEL for the past 5 years. She feels very satisfied with the loans granted to her as they have been given at the right moment, helping her to supply her business. She has a record of 8 loans.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n \r\nMaria F. es una dama casada y con dos hijas las que adem\u00e1s de ayudarle en el negocio tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n estudiando la secundaria, el negocio de esta se\u00f1ora es venta de comida, ella desde jovencita tiene experiencia en lo que respecta al negocio, ya que anteriormente ella trabaj\u00f3 de ayudante con una se\u00f1ora en este mismo negocio.
