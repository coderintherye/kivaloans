R. is a 44 year old gentleman who lives with his wife in the community of El Sauce de Santa Tersita in Turrialba, Cartago Province.  This small rural community has approximately 2000 residents, most of whom make their living by producing milk and growing coffee.  The area is hilly and much of the land consists of humid tropical forests.  In addition, the community has picturesque views that combine the tropical forests with two beautiful lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel and his family have dedicated much of their time to their dairy business.  They focus even more of their time now that a cheese factory has been built in their community by the El Sauce Milk Producers Association.  Since he has experience, Miguel is able to take care of all the demands required of his business.  In addition, he has imparted his knowledge to the rest of his family over time.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel wants to obtain a microloan of 500,000 CRC in order to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase his milk production by more than 40 liters per day, which will allow him to grow his business.  He wants to become a successful micro-entrepreneur so that he can help his family get ahead and pay for his son\u2019s university expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Miguel is a member of El Sauce Association of Producers, one of 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his eighth loan and he hopes to continue growing on a personal and financial level.  He says he is extremely grateful for the assistance the organization has provided so that he can accomplish his goals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

It is made up of eight women, all of whom are married and have at least five children. They have an average age of 50 and have been working together for over three years. Their main activities are raising cattle and\/or sheep, processing and selling peanut oil and local grain. The location of the village is advantageous to the group members and village women in general because many weekly markets are held nearby. So, on average, the women travel to the markets to sell their goods four days out of seven. This loan that they have been granted will allow them to buy steers and small ruminant animals to rear, as well as peanuts and local grain for their small-scale business. \r\n\r\nDue to the death of a family member, Siga S. was not present when the photo was taken, so she is not in it.\r\n\r\nFatou Elhadj D., standing on the right in the second row, is 48 years old and she has seven children. She conducts various business activities, such as selling peanut oil and local grain, as well as raising sheep. This new loan will basically allow her to buy some sheep that she will fatten up and sell after five months. As for the small-scale business, she will run it on the income she has made from her previous business activities. Her aim is to play a part in taking care of her children's needs, especially their schooling.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva

This community was known for its dam (20 years ago). The group is comprised of 10 members.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles M. is the president of the group. She is 39 years old, has a sixth-grade education, is married, and has a child. She sells embroidery, and has done this for six years.

She is seeking a loan to buy pants, shirts, and sweaters for women and men. She has around 100 clients in the areas of Chost, La Mesa, and Lanzados; little by little she has become known in the region. Initially she had a sewing workshop (15 years ago) in which she produced clothing. For personal reasons, she closed the business and distributed the capital among her associates, and from there came the idea to sell clothing. While asking for this loan, she is happy and satisfied to invest the credit into her business, as this season is good for sales due to school closures. She has orders from various clients and has to buy the clothing and distribute it. She is 38 years old, has a sixth-grade education, and is married with six children. She is originally from Mesa de Chosto. She wants this loan so she buy clothing to fill the orders of her clients. She also hopes to start another type of business. On weekends, she sells tostadas in the municipality of Acambay, and she would like to have an establishment for selling traditional foods.

For about twenty years, she has been living in the Cocotomey district, in the community of Abomey Calavi.  She is unmarried and has no children.  She lives by herself and is alone in supporting herself.  \r\n\r\nFati did not attend school.  To meet her needs, she sells various goods (rice, couscous, mayonnaise, sugar, canned tomatoes, toothpaste, matches, etc.) out of her home.  Secondarily, she sells cassava flour.  She gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, and also at the Cococodji market, in Abomey Calavi.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Fati has requested a loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to expand her business and to satisfy her customers further.  She has indeed repaid her first loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

The couple have six children, some of whom are enrolled in school. Martine has been living in the Djeffa neighborhood for 49 years. She lives with her husband and children and helps her husband support the family. \r\n\r\nMartine was not able to attend school. For about 20 years, Martine has been selling various items (pasta, candles, soap, tinned goods, plastic bags, batteries, sugar, sponges, insecticides, etc.) out of her home. This is the first time that she is asking for a loan from ALID\u00e9, in the intention of bolstering her business and growing her clientele, and thus her income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":561870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of various items for resale (pasta, candles, soap, tinned goods, plastic bags, batteries, sugar, sponges, insecticides, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-06-30T20:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zansi Martine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576249,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954763,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056418,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347953,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-19T09:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482979,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617795,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-26T09:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361167,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10689.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779870,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":21378.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-30T21:41:49Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211593,"name":"Loy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loy is married to an accountant and they have six children, all of whom graduated.

The other two children are working.  She also takes care of additional family members. Formerly Teopista was selling yellow and sweet bananas in Naguru market but relocated to Nakawa market.  She wants to use this loan to buy more bunches and clusters of yellow and sweet bananas.  She has been in this business for over thirteen years and with MCDT for five years. Teopista receives an average of twenty customers a day. \r\n\r\nShe buys these bunches and clusters of bananas from the very market where she works and so doesn\u2019t incur any transport costs.  Besides this banana business she also gets additional income from rental rooms. Teopista works seven days a week.

She stays competitive by being timely and through the prices and quality of her products.  This way, she is able to remain stable in the market, because between the stores in central Barranquilla, friends, relatives, and references, she has many clients.  She needs to buy materials for her work every three days, so she must have cash on hand to do so.  Currently, she is requesting her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will purchase fabric, thread, and adornments for the clothes she is making.\r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of owning a boutique.  On a personal level, she feels very successful because her children are professionals, even though she is separated from their father.  This is representative of how hard she worked to give them an education and a good quality of life, so that they would be prepared for the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie

He is married to a woman who is a petty trader with two children, ages one and six. He is now thirty years old. Kwaku lives together with his family in a town called Tarkwa, where he also does his trading. He is able to  support his family through supplying vegetables and condiments like tomatoes, peppers, onions, garden eggs (small eggplants), etc. to retailers.\r\n\r\nSupplying vegetables for the past three years, he has made quite many repeat and fresh customers through good customer relations.

Her group is located in San Pedro D. Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity is a free trading zone and a cement factory, but both running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure being a divorced mom with her two children.\r\n\r\nNicolasa is excited to be taking out her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her retail business where she sells cosmetics, natural medicine and other personal products. She will use the profits to buy more products and in the future to build her own shop and buy a vehicle for her business.

Nueva Esperanza 4 (New Hope 4), and her story is representative of her group and generally of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in San Pedro D. Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity is a free trading zone and a cement factory, but both running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and her four children.\r\n\r\nRamona is excited to be taking out her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling underwear and shoes in a Fantasia, which is a variety store that caters to women.

In addition to her business, she works several nights a week as a guard at a local school (soon she'll be able to retire and collect a pension).  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue generating employment opportunities for others through her business, and for that reason she has acquired 12 sewing machines and also subcontracted to others when she receives large contracts. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to start exporting her work to other countries, though the barriers and start up costs are great.  Gregoria Maria would especially like to send her work to Europe.  Her personal philosophy is to not be bothered by problems and complications, because she knows she can overcome anything.  From time to time she's had to confront clients as well as sub-contractors who didn't deliver, but she's always risen above.\r\n\r\nGregoria Maria is a positive woman who is working hard to grow her business, a business that has enabled her to put two children through college,  buy her own home, get a car, and employ several women.  She's asked for this loan from Kiva through FMSD to help pay for her youngest son's university studies. \r\n\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\n\r\nGregoria C\u00e1rdenas, propietaria de \u201cMarina Confecciones C\u00e1rdenas\u201d tiene este negocio, desde que decidi\u00f3 mejorar su calidad de vida hace ya 30 a\u00f1os, cuando sola con la responsabilidad de sus 3 hijos, emprendi\u00f3 la hoy microempresa dedicada a fabricar prendas de vestir en todas las  l\u00edneas  conocidas, porque conoce muy bien su arte y gradualmente lo ha perfeccionada con el tiempo y de la mano de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, quien la ha impulsado aprovechando su gran potencial de crecimiento como persona, como mujer y como empresaria. Gracias a este apoyo ha participado en ferias importantes de la confecci\u00f3n, como en Colombia Tex en Medell\u00edn, en el certamen ni\u00f1a Word de Colombia, y en jornadas de belleza y talento donde ha ganado premios. Gregoria cuenta, como al mismo tiempo que la Fundaci\u00f3n gan\u00f3 el premio a la excelencia, ella en ese mismo a\u00f1o tambi\u00e9n le otorgaron el premio a la mujer empresaria del a\u00f1o 2004 y tambi\u00e9n como, a trav\u00e9s de esta organizaci\u00f3n participo  en la Misi\u00f3n a Europa, donde mediante jornadas formativas aprendi\u00f3 nuevas t\u00e9cnicas y la actualizaci\u00f3n de dise\u00f1os y consigui\u00f3 muchas amistades del mismo sector de la confecci\u00f3n en Colombia, lo que  la ha  llevado a obtener contratos en los hoteles mas importantes de Barranquilla, a quienes hoy en d\u00eda les confecciona los manteles, viste tambi\u00e9n las sillas de las mesas y eventos importantes y fabrica la ropa de sus empleados. \r\nGregoria Marina con grandes esfuerzos de trabajo ha sacado a su familia adelante,  porque es una mujer que no se queda quieta, pues as\u00ed como tiene su negocio de confecciones, tambi\u00e9n trabaja en la noche en un colegio como secretaria,  donde est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima a recibir su pensi\u00f3n por jubilaci\u00f3n.  Su deseo siempre es generar empleo por eso adem\u00e1s de poner a funcionar sus 12 maquinas de confecci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n trabaja mediante talleres sat\u00e9lites cuando consigue los buenos contratos de los que siempre esta en su b\u00fasqueda. Ahora sue\u00f1a con exportar, pero le parecen muy dispendioso los requisitos y costos para hacerlo le gustar\u00eda que fuera a Europa  porque ganar\u00eda en euros,  En su filosof\u00eda no  plantea  el termino problemas, porque siempre logra lo que quiere, pero cree que lo mas dif\u00edcil es  cuando los clientes no pagan a tiempo y ella necesita responder a sus operarias y a la producci\u00f3n. De todas maneras es una mujer feliz porque sus hijos son profesionales y el \u00faltimo est\u00e1 en la universidad, siendo justamente la solicitud  de cr\u00e9dito que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n para pagarle su semestre. Gregoria Marina se manifiesta como una mujer prospera y exitosa, que con su esfuerzo   tiene una casa que ha adecuado como ha querido, un carro nuevo para transportarse, un importante taller de confecci\u00f3n  que produce y genera empleo  y una maravillosa familia que tambi\u00e9n avanza con pasos firmes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":560274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Pay for son's university studies.

His name is very well known there because he creates a very fine line of women's sandals, which for the climate are very useful in his state. Hernando began his business when he was unemployed five years ago, and a friend invited him to join the sandal-making business. Although he started out with little capital and a few tools, he has perfected his art though self-instruction and paying attention to whatever shoe magazine passed through his hands He takes the most beautiful styles and makes a basic form converting them into elegant sandals in formal and informal styles that adorn his clients' feet. Currently, Hernando is asking for his first loan from the Maria Santo Domingo Foundation, to invest in the purchase of raw materials and basic elements to make women's sandals, such as soles, glue, tools, synthetics, and accessories with which he will develop stylish designs. Hernando and his life partner dream of providing a quality education to their 5-year-old child. For this reason, his short-term goal is to buy a new industrial machine to replace the old sewing machine that he currently uses. In his production process, his biggest challenge is the time delay between orders and delivery, due to a lack of modern machinery, which will help make the process more efficient.<br

He is a very cheerful man, who earns his living selling fish. He has held this occupation for over 30 years, since he was a very young man working in the local maritime fishing industry in Puerto Colombia. He now runs his own business, which consists of buying and selling produce from the sea. Bernardo offers his customers very good prices, thanks to the bulk purchases he makes. Since Puerto Colombia is only 30 minutes away by land from the town of Barranquilla, very near to other districts in the Department of Atl\u00e1ntico, it is a popular tourist destination for families on the weekends. It is very likely that many eat the freshly-caught fish - such as pargos (snapper), cojin\u00faa (blue runner), 'el carito', 'lebranche', robalo (snook), and sierra (kingfish) - that Bernardo sells to the restaurants and hotels or inns located there. This will be Bernardo's first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he wants to spend on buying greater quantities of fish to satisfy his growing number of customers. His dream is to open a shop in the centre of Puerto Colombia, which would be well-equipped with cold rooms where customers from all over the department and local district could find the most delicious, fresh fish. Among the challenges he faces are climate change and maritime pollution.

She started selling different condiments and seasonings, such as onions, garlic, canned tomatoes, peppers, thyme, and bouillon cubes. She had a starting capital of 25000 Central African Francs; she has received secondary education. The current loan will allow her to expand her activities by purchasing three boxes of tuna, three boxes of bream and three boxes of cod. She lives in a neighborhood where salted fish is eaten a lot, and because of this she counts on earning a good income. Unless some of the fish she had purchased turns to be bad, her sales range from 45000 to 50000 Central African francs per day. Her goal in partnering with this microfinance institution is to take her business to the next levels and to help her neighbors with their business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to become a wholesaler, travel to discover other good markets for purchasing salted fish,   build a shop for selling salted fish wholesale and  support  upper-level studies for her children. \r\n\r\nIn her neighborhood, she has a reputation for being a calm person;

Conchita because their businesses are located in front of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the State of Mexico.  The group is composed of 10 members and this is the 4th time they have solicited a loan through CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n\r\nLeydy is 22 years old, married, and has completed the 6th year of primary school.  She is married and has no children.  Leydy is dedicated to the production and sale of bread, a business she started 3 years ago.  She is soliciting a loan to buy flour, sugar, and supplies for her stall.  Her clients are from the surrounding area and she sells on market days.  Leydy also sells to people from the same locality when there is a special event.  Besides bread, she also makes pizza, which she sells whole or by the slice.\r\n   \r\nAs she solicits this loan, Leydy feels very satisfied because she has just finished repaying a loan and is contemplating investing the new loan. It has cost her much work to keep the businesses going.  Despite the current economic situation, she has managed to grow, little by little, thanks to the loan, and to her husband's help.  Leydy suffered very much upon starting production, because she was helping her parents who permitted her to use their oven.  Then after she decided to become independent, it cost her much effort to take charge of her own affairs.  She hopes that in time, and with the h Help she will receive with this loan, she will be able to increase production, because she wants to expand her business, and that this will permit her to work hard to maintain the children that she plans to have.  For the moment, she only focuses on the idea of working to make her business larger.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nCrisanta (seasonal decorations)\r\nLaura (raising animals)\r\nMaria Guadalupo (raising and selling chickens)\r\nCarolina (raising cattle)\r\nSusana (raising and selling chickens) \r\nCarmen (selling vegetables) \r\nAmalia (selling clothes) \r\nAraceli (selling vegetables), and \r\nLourdes \r\n\r\nAll of these women appear in the photo except, from shyness, Guadalupe and Carolina remain a bit hidden among their companions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The town is a small rural community of approximately 2,000 people. Its residents work in milk production and coffee planting. Its terrain is hilly and a lot of the land is moist like a tropical forest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine tropical forest with two pretty lakes, plantations and dairy farms. \r\n\r\nCarlos and his family have been in the dairy business for about five years. He knows from experience as well as from instruction from relatives over time how demanding this business is. He currently wishes to obtain a loan in the amount of $975 to buy a dairy cow in order to increase his milk production. With this loan he will achieve business growth since milk demand is increasing and selling prices are very good. \r\n\r\nCarlos is a member of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce (El Sauce Producers Association), one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and financially.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Samantha Cerone, Kiva

In 1990, he lost his job because of the crisis. He had been a cashier at a big local supermarket (Presto). He began at that point to sell kerosene and to rent out plastic chairs, and after 2006, to sell phone time and telephone recharge cards. \r\n\r\nWith this loan he is intending to renew his stock of plastic chairs, add another 1000 liters of kerosene to his stock as well as a large quantity of telephone recharge cards from various mobile phone companies.

La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas.\nHace poco m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os, don Alexander se ha desarrollado como microempresario, con un peque\u00f1o proyecto dedicado a la  producci\u00f3n de leche y algunos derivados, tales como natilla y queso. El vive  con sus 2 hijos quienes han ayudado a mantener a flote el hogar y su peque\u00f1o negocio.  Colaboran tanto en la elaboraci\u00f3n como en la comercializaci\u00f3n de los productos.\nDice estar muy satisfecho  con este proyecto, ya que le ha generado una mayor confianza, ha servido como una fuente de ingresos para mejorar sus condiciones a pesar de algunos problemas que aquejan a la comunidad y sin dejar de lado que ha logrado mantener a su familia unida. Y no han tenido que emigrar a la ciudad a buscar trabajo.\nActualmente Don Alexander requiere un pr\u00e9stamo de \u00a2623,000 (Seiscientos veintitr\u00e9s mil colones) con el fin de comprar una vaca lechera, la cual asegura conocer bastante bien porque es de su vecino. Con esta vaca el pretende aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche y  as\u00ed generar m\u00e1s ingresos que le permita seguir creciendo como Microempresario\n","en":"Alexander Fern\u00e1ndez V. is a 35 year old man who lives with his wife and 2 children in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in Cartago province. It is a small rural community with around 2,000 inhabitants, mostly producing milk and coffee beans. The area has hilly terrain and a lot of it is tropical rain forest. There are some real beauty spots, where the tropical forest meets two lovely lakes, coffee plantations and dairy farms. \r\n\r\nIn a little over two years, Alexander has developed himself into a micro-entrepreneur, with a small business producing milk and milk products such as cheese and cream. His children have helped him keep the home and business running, even helping to make and market the produce. He says he is very happy with this project: it has increased his confidence and provided income to improve their living conditions despite difficulties that have befallen the little community - indeed it has enabled him to keep his family together, as it means he has not had to leave to find work in the city. Now Alexander needs a loan of 623,000 colones ($1200) in order to buy a milk cow from his neighbour. With this cow he will be able to increase his production, generate more income, and continue to develop as an entrepreneur.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva

She was in a partnership with her sister, and they worked together in the business.  After a few years it came into her ownership.  She comments that it has really helped her with the home and family income.\n\nShe is inspired to work because, thanks to the work, she has been able to get ahead day to day without taking a step backwards.  That is why she requested a loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C.  She will use the loan for work, and with the earnings she gets she will save and build a place.  At the place she builds she will be able to better take care of her customers, and they will be happy and satisfied with the service.\n\nLizbeth became part of the group because her cousin, Limni, invited her to join the other members.

She makes fast food, such as sandwiches, potatoes and cornmeal rolls that she sells.  This business is going very well for her. She learned it as a child when her father lost his job and her mother began to do it to pay for the household expenses, especially her siblings' schooling.  When they grew up, they helped her father and she finished high school and began to study to be nursing assistant. This activity served for her to work in a business, but when she lost her job, she began her business since she already knew about, \"selling fast food\". This business lets her take care of herself, of her responsibilities and to help her parents and siblings. That is why Marlys is always planning on growing it to get everybody ahead. During this whole time she has recieved two loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and with them she has been able to establish her credit history. Previously, she didn't have any financing and this has allowed her to improve her service. Her goal for the future is to expand her business, have her own home, help her parents build a second floor and finish her professional studies. Marly thinks that at this time there are few opportunities to develop professionally and that is why she has taken up an activity that helps her support herself and feel at ease as an enterprising woman.   \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":562208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase raw materials wholesale such as eggs and flour.

Her dreams are simple and all are for the welfare of her family. Through ASHI and its services, especially loans, Shirley hopes to have a stable and profitable business one day. The profit she will make out of this would be her support and the financial assistance she needs to improve the lifestyle of her family. \r\n\r\nSince Shirley joined ASHI in 1997, she has been able to sustain a business in partnership with her husband, financed by the loans she has received. Shirley and her husband catch \u201cbangus\u201d (Philippine national fish: milk fish) fingerlings from the shallow part of the ocean for resale. An implement used for this fishing activity is a fishnet with a bamboo frame and handle. This kind of activity is seasonal yet it generates good income for Shirley to be able to put aside savings meant to support the needs of her family when \u201cbangus\u201d fingerlings are off-season.  Sometimes her husband works as a part-time driver of a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for transportation. This way she never has problems in repaying the loan she has requested. As a matter of fact, Shirley has been a very good member of ASHI.\r\n\r\nPresently, \u201cbangus\u201d fingerlings are in season. Shirley wishes to purchase materials for making an implement for fishing and increase the volume of their catch to have larger amount of profit. In this way, she will be able to support her family's needs, especially the education of her youngest, eight-year-old child. She really hopes that this child will graduate from college just like her eldest child who has just recently begun working for ASHI as an ASHI staff member. Her other three children are supported by her most of the time since they are just small-time hired laborers and are earning very little. \r\n\r\n

During the off-season, she warehouses her harvest for a certain time so that it grows in value before selling it at the Dan and San markets and in surrounding marketplaces, retail (or often wholesale) for cash to a clientele generally coming from the big cities.\r\n\r\nAfter their produce is sold, the members of the group each expect to make a profit of 25,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the interest on the loan and for on-going family expenses., like the other members of the group, expects to make a profit of 35,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the interest on the loan and for on-going family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":562473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of agricultural entrants, seed, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dah Manakina","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-04T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maeima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":276500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":276500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":276500,"processed_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":281930.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-04T21:52:31Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211860,"name":"Yawa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A. yawa est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 20 ans et est c\u00e9libataire.

After wintering the crops, the harvest is stored for a while in order to gather value before being sold at the large Yangasso, Bla and other markets. Sales are in cash for individual or bulk items, and the customer base generally comes from large towns. \r\n\r\nThe group members aim to generate an average profit of 42,500 FCFA which will be used to repay the loan interest and to meet the family's everyday costs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":562495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of inputs, grain and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djigonso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-04T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata M ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia K ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan Ze","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bahoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rouht","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":395000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":395000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":395000,"processed_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":402757.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-04T17:29:42Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211877,"name":"Abra","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 44 ans, D. abra est mari\u00e9e avec 3 enfants.

 Their businesses are: the preparation and sale of foods like bread, empanadas, sweets, and salads (among others); kiosks and hardware shops; door-to-door clothing sales; and fishing.\r\n\r\nJulia is the secretary of the communal bank, in the attached picture you see her in the center, with a beige zip-up fleece and sort hair, making bunny ears over the head of one of the other group members.  For ten years Julia has been preparing breads, empanadas, and \"berlines\" (round pastries with cream filling) in her home, and selling the products from her home to neighbors, friends, and other clients she has met.  The best times for sales are over holidays and long weekends, when people arrive to enjoy the beach in Cartagena.\r\n\r\nJulia has the support of her husband, who is a bread maker.  They have five grown children, who live independently with families of their own.\r\n\r\nWith the Fondo Esperanza loan, Julia will purchase ingredients and is considering the possibility of also purchasing a large mechanical bread mixer, which will help her make the dough for her products.  Her husband can help her in the purchase of the machine, because the cost is pretty high.\r\nJulia's dream is to have a bread shop in Cartagena where she, her husband, and two of her sons can work; one of them is also a bread maker and the other makes pastries.\r\n\r\nOf the work she has done with Fondo Esperanza, Julia notes that the promotion of the value of the interpersonal relationship between the members of the group has been very important; especially their efforts to share the wisdom of their experiences with the younger members, and to help one another resolve problems.  In terms of business, the most noteworthy part has been the training she and the other communal bank members have received on how to better manage their finances. \r\n\r\nCartagena is a beach community located in central Chile, very close to the port of San Antonio.  The town\u2019s economy depends primarily on tourism, especially in the summer and over holidays, during which many people come from nearby Santiago (Chile's capital).  The town's population nearly doubles in the summer because of the tourists, whose business is a large source of income for the commercial and service providers in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

H. is 41 years old and lives in the Sonsonate department.  She lives with her working spouse and her two children who are studying.  Reyna owns a tortilla shop where she has worked for over 15 years.  It has been a very profitable business, in high demand, because the tortilla is part of the basic Salvadoran diet.  She is a very hard worker and visionary who has the ability to produce very good traditional dishes, which is why she wants to expand her business sales.  Reyna is requesting a loan through which she can have the money to invest for selling pupusas (a traditional Salvadoran food).  She will buy wholesale corn to make her tortillas and pupusas; Likewise she will buy cheese, pork, beans, tomatoes and other ingredients for the development of the latter.  She also wants to buy a bigger stove called \u201cplancha\u201d, which is especially used for making tortillas and pupusas, so she can make a large quantity of these and thus serve more customers.

She wants to continue to invest in the business and to continue saving in order to build her house.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":562617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy buttons, ribbons, wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-07-06T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casimira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Charo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virgilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfonza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dania Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranulfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12400,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3107.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630056,"comment":null},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3100,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-18T07:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3107.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844102,"comment":null},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3100,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3107.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110280,"comment":null},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3100,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3107.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542047,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T11:12:48Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":211927,"name":"Valentine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentine is 39 years old and has seven children, three of whom are her own and four are adopted.

The company that supplies the products to her usually gives her more points the more customers she attracts so she earns more.\r\n\r\nShe also works preparing typical cakes and sweets which she sells from her home.  With her earnings she helps her husband with family expenses.  He works in a garage.\r\n\r\nJackeline wants to acquire beauty products on her own to set up a small sales stand in her home that is permanently stocked.  This would allow her to give her customers better service by having the products on hand and not having to wait until the end of the month to get them when the order arrives.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach her goal she saw that she needed to apply for a loan of 1000 PEN for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa.

Before opening her own business, Monica spent five years working for a watch salesman at the market and refining her own sales skills. However, she worked long and difficult hours and did not retain control over the profits she made. In 2001, Monica decided it was finally time to become her own boss. Getting started was difficult, she said, especially figuring out things like permits, but she is glad she did. \r\n\r\nMonica\u2019s stall is now open for business Thursday to Sunday every week, and she has one employee who helps her on the busier weekend days. A $3,500 loan from Opportunity Fund will allow her to increase her inventory and consequently boost sales. To help manage the growth, Monica\u2019s husband, Paul, will begin working at the stall with her. Until recently, Paul made a living selling paintings. He explains that the market for artwork has suffered recently. The couple is excited to have the opportunity now to work together at Monica's stall. \r\n\r\n\"I already have the satisfaction of working for myself, but I hope my business grows more,\" said Monica when asked about her goals for the future. She is proud of her success and that it enables her to send money to Mexico to help her parents and to support her sister's education. While she has a few cousins in the United States, the rest of her family lives in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMonica first learned about Opportunity Fund from a brochure that a cousin gave her. Her experience has been very positive and she hopes to get a slightly larger loan in the future. \"I am very grateful to Opportunity Fund,\" says Monica, \"because I'm going to keep moving forward with my business.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2876.04,"image":{"id":562744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Thanks to his efforts he was able to purchase a car, which up until now has been the main source of income. His wife helps with the household expenses by selling artesanal objects, and they have been able to work together to progress and bring up their beloved son. \r\n\r\nJulio\u2019s work keeps him busy all day long, only allowing him time to stop for lunch, because if wants to earn the income he dreams of he must work very hard without stopping. Because he uses his car so much, it has suffered some breakdowns and Julio would like to improve its condition so he can work with total peace of mind. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he assures lenders that he will continue to make his repayments. With this loan he hopes to refurbish his car to bring it up to optimal condition.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva

He would like to establish his business in another location in order to obtain new customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":562787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-07-04T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddy Enrrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.55,"local_amount":1252.8,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1292.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761832,"comment":null},{"amount":65.61,"local_amount":1357.53,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1400.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848800,"comment":null},{"amount":63.76,"local_amount":1319.12,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256735,"comment":null},{"amount":68.47,"local_amount":1416.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1461.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802731,"comment":null},{"amount":62.54,"local_amount":1294.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1335,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956562,"comment":null},{"amount":61.72,"local_amount":1276.9,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1317.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685681,"comment":null},{"amount":61.62,"local_amount":1274.89,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191424820,"comment":null},{"amount":61.96,"local_amount":1281.87,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195843792,"comment":null},{"amount":218.77,"local_amount":4526.22,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4669.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201285925,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T04:13:02Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:04:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":212002,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna Gloria is 41 years of age and a resident of Batangan, Hamtic, one of the most historical towns in the province of Antique. Most \u201cHamticanon\u2019s\u201d, or people of Hamtic, are dependent on farming for their livelihood. Vegetables, rice, fruits, root crops and corn are some of the most common crops they grow to sell for a living.\r\n\r\nMyrna and her hired-construction-worker husband are one of the couples who contribute to the number of farmers of the municipality. Both are poor yet hardworking. They are determined to improve their standard of living and give their seven children a better future through the profit they earn from rice farming.\r\n\r\nThe loan Myrna is requesting right now will be invested in this, hoping that she will increase her harvest and will sell larger volume for more profits.\r\n\r\nMyrna also plans that some amount of her loan will be used to finance her desire to grow a hog-fattening business. She has been doing this kind of business previously and this has given her and her family good profits. The hogs she fattens after four months are sold either alive or slaughtered to people in their village or in the market.\r\n\r\nHaving farming and hog fattening businesses, Myrna believes that it is much easier to improve their standard of living through the profits she would be making. \r\n\r\nWithout a loan to support Myrna\u2019s need to finance her farming and hog-fattening businesses, she wouldn\u2019t have an income for her family, especially for supporting the basic needs of her children. Frustration, because her two eldest daughters were not able to graduate from high school and are now working as housemaids, the earnings of which are just too small and insufficient for their own needs, has led her to this kind of worry. As much as possible, she wants all of her children to graduate from college in the future and have a life that is not poor. Now, she has five children who go to school and that she needs to support with a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":562790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hayde has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 12th cycle loan, in the amount of 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use on her general store. Merlita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

F. is a 50-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: rice and feeds retailing, and general store. She lives in Purak Genpas, Barangay West, Cauayan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nJosephena has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her rice and feeds retailing and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of P20,000.\r\n\r\nJosephena is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can purchase an additional stock of rice. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.

Lorelyn would like a loan to finance the repairs needed for the tricycle.  She cannot run a business right now because her children are very young (two years old and seven month old).\r\n\r\nWith loans through ASHI, Lorelyn hopes to one day purchase many tricycles for a transportation business.  By then she would need drivers to operate the vehicles. She would help many unemployed men in their village as well as their families. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":562838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase motorcycle spareparts and pay for tricycle repair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Patnongon, Antique","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1626.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159565359,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166774141,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":929.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172042847,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":929.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177333265,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182468263,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T10:03:03Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:54:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":212026,"name":"Kov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kov C. is 39 years old.
