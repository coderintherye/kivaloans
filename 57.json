K. Sareth, 41, and her husband, Kuch Von, have been married since 1990. Their four children, ages 6-17, are all attending local schools. Sareth and her husband have had a business of buying and reselling flowers and bananas for the past 27 years. Once a week, they drive 10 km to purchase their goods from local farmers before making the journey into Phnom Penh to resell at the large markets there. They currently sell seven varieties of flowers and two of banana. Von also farms tobacco and raises pigs to help support the family.\r\n\r\nSareth is requesting her third loan from MAXIMA in the amount of $1,200. She will use this loan to purchase a one-season contract at specific flower and banana farms. Previous loans were used for the same purpose. By this system, the wholesaler estimates the output per farm and bids on a contract for everything grown that season. Because of the high up-front cost, Sareth finds it difficult to save this money, which is why she is seeking another loan. These contracts for goods will provide the family with a stable income over the next many months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":99811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Buy flowers and

She will use this loan to purchase a one-season contract at specific flower farms. Previous loans were used for the same purpose. By this system, the wholesaler estimates the output per farm and bids on a contract for everything grown that season. Jasmine plants do not have a significant output of buds every day so Nheb collects these small amounts from many farms to sell in bulk. Sometimes she collects 300 grams, and sometimes up to 3 kilos. The local middleman comes to her house every day to make a purchase. Because of the high up-front cost, Nheb finds it difficult to save this money, which is why she is seeking another loan.

Mwangi M. is 25 years old and married with 2 children. James lives in a town called Ruai on the outskirts of Nairobi. James is a businessman. He runs a general shop which is situated at the Ruai Center. James started off as a waiter in a hotel from the year 2002-2003, but he decided to quit the job due to poor working conditions including a very low salary. In the year 2004, he started a green grocery stand with savings which he earned from his previous job. Through the profits that he earned from the grocery, he expanded his business and started selling cereals and stocking items like sugar, flour and salt.\r\n<p>\r\nJames's business has been doing well, although he finds that he has been unable to increase his stock due to lack of finances since he has a business to run and also a family to support. As a result, his business has come to a standstill while he has been wondering where he can get money since the few banks that he tried to approach charged high interest rates that he felt he could not pay. While still wondering about this, he noted that his friend and neighbor, Mary Wamaitha, who is a beneficiary of a Kiva loan, had suddenly raised her business from nowhere, and it was growing fast. He therefore inquired how she had managed to do it so quickly, and she informed him about Kiva. He was greatly impressed. Mary went further and brought him to the ANK offices so that he could also receive support. \r\n<p>\r\nJames is kindly requesting a loan of US$650 which he will use to stock his shop with cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar, and flour, among other items. He believes that, with this loan, he will be able to expand his business and increase the number of customers he has. This way, he will be better able to support his family. Since he is a young person, he also hopes that he will be able to expand his business up to a wholesale level over time.\r\n<p>\r\nThe repayment period for this loan will be 9 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":99820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase stock for a general store, including cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar and flour etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-15T15:06:01Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135692,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158282,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182975,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210469,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238604,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267485,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296683,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-16T07:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327299,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":66,"local_amount":4061.54,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4138.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360799,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-01T15:06:01Z","paid_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":28162,"name":"Sivorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. S.

Between 1999 and 2003 she opened three businesses: one selling charcoal, one selling fish, and a shop\/stall selling groceries. Rukia has already repaid two loans from SELFINA and now requires another to expand her first business, charcoal. These small, black and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to Sarah but to her customers who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. Which is good news for Rukia, who requires a loan of $1075 in order to add to her stock of mkaa and continue meeting customer demand. <P>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation for women.<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

He will use the loan to purchase 3 heads of cattle to raise and sell them.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

child orphaned by HIV\/AIDS. To help her husband out with the costs of daily life, she started a fruit stand in 2000. Seasonal fruit prices meant it was difficult for her to regularly stock her fruit stand, and she had to give up on the business. Her husband gave her the start up capital to begin another small business, this time selling charcoal. \r\n\r\nMost people in the rural parts of Kenya buy charcoal or kerosene on a regular basis as they have no access to electricity. Teresa now sells ten large bags of charcoal per day, each one with a retail value of about ten US dollars. The profits from her charcoal business have enabled her to start selling kerosene, which she buys in bulk from the oil companies and sells in small quantities to rural households.

M. is 52, has a college degree in economics, is married and has 10 children. Mamlakat is in the business of selling fabric that is used to create national female gowns. She cells on the central market of the city of Yanvana that is called \"Tidjorat\". She has been working in this business for the past 11 years. Currently she has purchased another sales location on the same market. Because she has used her savings to purchase this sale location, she is asking for a loan that will allow her to purchase goods to sell at this second sales location. She is planing to purchase children's winter clothing. This will allow the locals to purchase children's clothing on the local market, while Mamlakat will have an additional source of income that will help her take care of her large family. Her son helps her with the business.\r\nShe is planing to repay the loan within 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

Then she opens the sewing shop and devotes herself to sewing the garments her customers ordered, as well as others to be sold in the store. With this loan for $750 that she will repay in 6 months, she will invest in expanding her business by purchasing a new sewing machine, a mending machine that will give her garments a better finish, as well as fabrics, threads of every color, elastic bands, lace, etc.  <p>\r\nObertila is very pleased, she told us, because she celebrated her birthday in the company of her friends at the communal bank and with her loved ones.

His leadership abilities help him to be able to organize any type of committee to benefit his community.  Victor has worked in agriculture for around twenty years.  Recently the harvests were jeopardized by inclement weather but even with that he continued persevering with the sowing of potato, beans and oats.  He is motivated by his wife and 4 children.  He seeks to intensify his activities in raising animals so that they can become another way of maintaining his home.  To do this he will buy a cow to fatten it up and sell it later.

lives in the town of Saalti, in the Repbulic of Azerbaijan in Transcaucasia.  He is 39 and married with two children.  Arif is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market.  Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages.  He raises them with the help of his wife (see photo) in 8-9 months and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.  Today Arif is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family.  He plans to purchase an additional 5 calves per year.  To do this, he needs to invest an additional $500 in his business.

The two siblings have been operating their dirt hauling business for two years. Currently they have two horses and carts but would like to buy two more.

Each year during the monsoon, the river swells and deposits tons of silt along its banks.

He grew up with his parents and attended school until the 4th grade when he had to stop because of the war in 1982.  When he was 15 year old (1986) he began fishing with his father for six years and was able to arrange conditions for marriage in the church in 1992.  In the same year as is custom he went to South Africa where he worked for a fishing company for 8 years. He was able to save enough money that he came to Mozambique, bought a sail boat, and began fishing again.<p>\r\n\r\nHe asked for a loan through Hluvuku for 6.000,00MT to buy fishing nets.  With this work he is able to support a family of 8 people, his 5 children, his wife, and her parents.  With good management he was able to purchase 3 boats with motors and employ 4 workers plus others depending on the needs of the day.  When there are lots of waves (wind) he needs more workers to pull out the nets, and the number varies between 8 and 10 people.<p>\r\n\r\nThrough his experience as a sailor he was hired to be a boat driver by a tourist company that works in the area.  The job opened his eyes to offering transport services to take people and goods from Mozambique to South Africa and back, but he realized he did not have sufficient funds to pursue it unless he returned one more time to Hluvuku to ask for a loan of $1,200US to buy the vehicle in South Africa.  He will be able to hire 2 people, a driver and a helper.  Most likely he will consolidate his projects (fishing and transport) and be a reference in the community where poverty continues to affect more than 80% of the population.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p><p>\r\n\r\nDaniel Machecane N., de 36 anos de idade, natural de santa maria, posto administrativo de Machangulo, Distrito de Matutuine, Provincia do Maputo, cresceu junto com os pr\u00f3prios pais, tendo se escolarizado at\u00e9 4\u00aa Classe, onde deixou de continuar com os estudos  devido a guerra, isto em 1982.<p>\r\n   \r\nAos 15 anos (1986) come\u00e7ou actividade pesqueira junto do seu pai durante seis anos tendo conseguido criar condi\u00e7\u00f5es  para o casamento pela igreja em 1992, e no mesmo ano como costume da zona foi a Africa do sul, onde trabalhou numa empresa de pesca durante oito anos, dai poupou do seu sal\u00e1rio um valor que veio a Mo\u00e7ambique comprar um barco a vela e recome\u00e7ou a pesca em Mo\u00e7ambique.<p>\r\n\r\nTendo recorrido a Hluvuku pedir emprestimo no valor de 6.000,00mt para compra de redes de pesca.

how do you make bricks?

Then you make a wooden mold in which you will wet the earth, making mud and slopping it into the molds. When the mold is dry enough to keep its form, you release the bricks from the mold. You let them dry enough to be stacked. Create a 2ft x 2ft hole at the bottom of the stack . This is where you will build your fire. For three days you will tend the fire, not too, just smoldering, until all the bricks have been baked. After baking you will cover with straw so the rains don\u2019t erode away all your hard work. You will be able to sell each brick for about five cents. <p>\r\n\r\nSafina has been doing this for about 4 years.

From her earnings, she will be better able to support the needs of her children, such as their schooling, health and nutrition.  \r\n<p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\nN\u00e9e en 1966, Madame A.

People regularly talk to each other about how their farm animals are doing because a sick animal can have a large impact on a family, even a neighborhood. Annet has two pigs, and a goat. For now, she will use her loan to buy more supplies for her retail store, i.e. sugar, rice, paraffin, salt, etc."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":100649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Annet plans to use her loan to buy more sacks of sugar, rice, paraffin, salt, etc, for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-01-01T15:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-15T17:05:50Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107,"local_amount":176235.29,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":181472,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135985,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":107,"local_amount":176235.29,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":181472,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158687,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":107,"local_amount":176235.29,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":181472,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183399,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":104,"local_amount":171294.12,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":176384,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210945,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-01T17:05:50Z","paid_date":"2008-05-15T09:09:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":28574,"name":"Wo\u00e9vi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"At 27, Mrs. Wo\u00e9vi A. is a young married woman and the mother of 4 children.

Produce stands in rural areas are not nearly as prominent as in urban areas for the simple reason that almost everyone is a subsistence farmer and grow whatever they need on their own plot of land.<p>\r\nPeople in this part of Uganda do not want for food. People will tell you that the food is free, it grows everywhere. Most is planted, but there is plenty of wild mango, papaya, avocado, matooke, jackfruit, etc. With a few chickens, and a goat, you're set. Even the land is shared and Ugandans are also very welcoming.

B. is a perfect example of why microfinance works, and why the large majority of clients repay their loans.  A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or kiva.org) for the first time ask anxiously, \u201cbut how do you make sure people pay back?  Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d  The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually the poor) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people.  Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant for a number of reasons.  \r\n\r\nFirstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk.  More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive.  The incentive is for clients to be able to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026 The incentive is to have on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\nTwawiya began this journey in 2002 when she opened a shop selling a variety of foodstuffs.  Since then, she has received and repaid four loans of progressively increasing amounts from SELFINA, which she has used to expand her business.  Twawiya now purchases all her stock in bulk, which has enabled her to increase her profits.  \r\n\r\nThis time, Twawiya requires a loan of $1075 to purchase stocks of soda, flour and sugar.
