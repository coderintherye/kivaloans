They are still working these lands, but they are now far more productive, and their crops are high quality. What Balvina most enjoys about her work is the close relationship that she has with the land. She greatly enjoys watching her crops grow. She now has to work the land full-time because, thanks to the geography of the area, the state is building a hydroelectric power station where her husband is working in order to obtain extra money. She finds her greatest challenge to be caring for her land in difficult weather, since everything can affect the harvest. In the future, she hopes to have the necessary funds to purchase a vehicle. She belongs to the \"Pioneros de Cumutay\" communal bank and this is her first loan with MFP. She hopes for the support of each one of you in order to continue with her plans. Balvina, with your support, will invest the requested loan in the purchase of a bag of pea seeds for her next crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":813133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a bag of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835509,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T00:37:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316586,"name":"Alejandro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past three years Alejandro, a 79-year-old married father of seven, has owned his own small grocery store which sells a variety of products.

Among the different suggestions about where the saying comes from, some say that it comes from something that an English person originally said \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca is like London) owing to the abundant mist that frequently covers the city in winter, just like it does in the English

With this loan, Juana will buy more coffee seeds so that she can increase production.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":813267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy coffee seeds to plant on her available land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":306.36},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":315.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":326.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":339.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":350.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":361.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.44},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.89,"local_amount":306.36,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":314.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719273,"comment":null},{"amount":118.18,"local_amount":315.15,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":323.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350743,"comment":null},{"amount":122.49,"local_amount":326.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":335.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851108,"comment":null},{"amount":127.44,"local_amount":339.83,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":349.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666285,"comment":null},{"amount":131.3,"local_amount":350.13,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":359.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621434,"comment":null},{"amount":135.7,"local_amount":361.87,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":371.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T22:37:12Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316632,"name":"Edilson Vladimir","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edilson, vive con su familia, su esposa y un hijo, solamente este hijo depende de \u00e9l, su oficio es la ganader\u00eda, inicio con ayuda de su padre, no tiene un horario fijo establecido.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de ganado de repasto, esta compra le permitir\u00e1 crecer y ampliar el n\u00famero de ganado.\nSu aspiraci\u00f3n es ser un ganadero en grande, que produzca l\u00e1cteos, y proveer para su familia el sustento necesario.\n","en":"Edilson lives with his family, his wife and son; this son is his only dependent.

Teofila has previously worked in a number of different jobs, but always longed to have her own business. With her savings and the support of her partner, she therefore opened a clothing stall. Her stall is now well frequented by her customers, since she offers top-quality clothing and because she is a very attentive salesperson. She always welcomes her customers cordially and puts herself at their disposal while they make their purchases, and so they are satisfied customers.\r\n\r\nHer business is always kept tidy, which is appreciated by the clientele; she trades in the city of Quimbiri, where people pay attention to quality.

They are Denys, Lourdes, and Fatima, aged 19, 15, and 14 years old respectively. They are in school and one of them has started going to university. Her dream is to see them become successful professionals and to enjoy better living conditions to what she has had. For Teresa her children are everything and she works very hard to support them. She sells every day consumer goods from a small store that she has managed to establish in her own home. She is a trustworthy woman and she is very kind. This has helped her to earn the trust of her entire neighborhood. They prefer to buy from her because she always has whatever they need and above all they receive good customer service. Lately she has been going a lot of thinking on how to make her business grow. She has decided to stock her store with a variety of products that would be attractive to clients. Fro this reason she requests a loan from Integral (Kiva Field Partner). She will purchase the goods which are in highest demand: drinks, rice, beans, cooking oil, snacks, bathroom tissue, pastries, coffee, etc. This will help her to attract more clients and it will help her achieve her dream of providing her children with better

She is is 42 years old and married with a 6-year-old son who has not started his education yet. Her husband is a rickshaw driver providing transport services to passengers. He has been operating his transport business for the past 16 years. As a result, his rickshaw has grown old and on time maintenance is required.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, Khalida has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah for her husband who will replace his rickshaw body with a new one and also do some repair work so it performs better.

45 years old, lives in Capellan, Ilagan, Isabela. She has a sari-sari store ( variety or general store) that sells snack food, groceries, soft drinks, and other daily basic needs. Her entrepreneurial idea started with the help of her husband and daughter. She was unemployed and her daughter helped her to provide the starting capital for her store.

Most of the clothes they sew may not even be bought, if the price is not that pocket favorable. Most people would rather make do with secondhand clothing. This, however, was not a factor that could dampen Joyce's spirits 30 years ago, when she sought to earn her keep and obtain a footing in this business.\r\n\r\nShe has, by and large, had a chequered experience running this business. At the beginning, she was mostly sewing school uniforms for schools. With time, she diversified and starting sewing all sorts of clothes to sell. With orders from schools increasing, and her other clothes (mostly lady's clothes) selling favorably in her shop, Joyce knew that, with determination, she could make headway. The new lease on life in her business was translating into better sales profits. Given her nature, however, she could not rest on her laurels. This is one attribute which has kept her business afloat. Most of her friends say she is never complacent.\r\n\r\nWeekly, her business sales revenue totals up to 60,000 Ugandan shillings. This is modest by her standards but she remains upbeat. The economic status quo in the country as of now is adverse and she knows most people are facing it tough. Once the situation improves, she envisages better conditions for her business. For Joyce's group, this is their second loan cycle. Joyce says she is requesting this Kiva loan money to purchase more clothes-making textile materials. With this, she reckons she will be able to make more clothes and school uniforms to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":813659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase more clothes-making textile materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mpigi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.083333 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Specioza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edrisa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teopista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mastulla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6500000,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1631782.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248983,"comment":null},{"amount":1262.5,"local_amount":3250000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3263564.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868552,"comment":null},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1631782.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648386,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T00:21:39Z","paid_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316887,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Nasceu na Cidade de Maputo, provincia de mesmo nome, sul de Mocambique casada e m\u00e3e de 4 filhos de 9 a 25 anos de idade todos v\u00e3o a Escola.

She also saves some money in her bank acount (at BIM).\r\n\r\nVeronica has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also customers of this institution. This is her second loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 17,000 meticais, which she will use to buy products (Colgate, peanuts, Omo laundry soap, soft drinks and other items) to increase her inventory. The earlier loan was for 10,000 meticais and was used for business.\r\n\r\nVeronica will make her payments as scheduled, and in the future she intends to ask for more loans to buy a vehicle, and to do that she will ask Hluvuku for loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.39,"image":{"id":813709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy and sell products (Colgate, peanuts, Omo laundry soap, soft drinks, etc.).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2011-07-20T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":944.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":944.44,"processed_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":949.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227066808,"comment":null},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":944.44,"processed_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":949.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232827403,"comment":null},{"amount":34.73,"local_amount":944.44,"processed_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":949.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238639380,"comment":null},{"amount":96.16,"local_amount":2615.44,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T09:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245019282,"comment":null},{"amount":42.39,"local_amount":1152.91,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257740490,"comment":null},{"amount":53.67,"local_amount":1459.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1467.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263354213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-21T05:27:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316890,"name":"Florinda","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Nasceu na Cidade de Maputo, Provincia de mesmo nome, sul de Mocambique \u00e9 casada e m\u00e3e de 4 filhos dos quais n\u00e3o lembra as respectivas idades.

is married with children. She owns a business in the central market of Gafurov region where she sells fabrics for sewing national women's dresses. Shoira has been in this trade for about eight years. Her business has seen considerable growth since she modernized her vending facility using loans from IMON International. Shoira has been partnering with our organization for about eight years. Shoira is requesting a loan of 13,000 TJS to increase her assortment of inventory and boost her sales. She is ready to continue working hard to see her business grow and thrive. Her ultimate goal is to provide a better life for her family. She also plans to invest part of her profit in doing some basic remodeling of her apartment. She did not have any problems with previous loan repayments. We hope the current loan will also be repaid without any delinquencies, and we are excited to promote the further expansion of Shoira's enterprise. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Moreover, the dried fruit is as a rule served during all the family occasions like wedding parties, birthday parties and others.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

By this, he hopes that Kiva will offer him the loan to do well along with his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a widow with one child. She runs a small business in the central city market selling kid\u2019s clothing. Her vending spot is well known for her wide variety of inventory. The assorted clothing items Dilbar offers for sale in her kiosk are in high demand among her customers. Dilbar has been in this trade for 10 years. Dilbar\u2019s hard work, plain and simple, is the engine that drives her success. She is very consistent in her business planning. Now she is requesting a loan of 9,500 Somoni to increase her assorted merchandise in a recently opened vending location and to expand her trade. One of Dilbar\u2019s long-term plans is to launch her own start-up manufacturing and selling clothing and increase her stock turnover as a result. \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is now a decade in this trade for this happily married mother of six. Before taking root in this business, Flavia was engaged in a retail trade. She dispensed with it in time. The last 10 years have been years of mixed fortunes in her business transactions but she says the successes outweigh the failures. That, in many respects, explains why she is still in this business.

began his New Iberia, Louisiana-based business, Big Dooley\u2019s Express, to fulfill his long-time goal of working for himself instead of someone else. Six years ago, after five years in the carrier business, George decided to pursue an opportunity to purchase a FedEx truck and route from another FedEx contractor. By becoming a FedEx contractor, George was able to work for himself while guaranteeing the business stability of a large, established company.\n\nHowever, becoming a contractor for FedEx was not easy, says George. Firstly, breaking into the world of FedEx contracting is extremely difficult. Of this, he says, \u201cStarting out without a route makes it hard to obtain another contractor\u2019s business. When you have four or five routes and trucks, you have the income and reputation needed to secure new routes.\u201d Contractors with more than one route also have access to yearly bonuses that single-route owners do not, allowing them more freedom to expand.\n\nAdditionally, George says that securing and maintaining employees with only one route is extremely difficult. \u201cWhen you only have one route, you cannot really pay your employees the top dollar that you\u2019d like to, so keeping reliable work around is difficult at this stage in the game.\u201d He currently has one employee, but he says the turn-over happens more quickly than he\u2019d like.\n\nHowever, according to George, these problems can all be easily resolved by growing his business to include more routes. Not only will the additional routes bring in more capital and give him access to quarterly bonuses from FedEx, it will also allow him to pay his employees more and provide them with health insurance. Ultimately, he\u2019d like to have \u201cenough employees to sustain a smoothly running business.\u201d\n\nAfter being denied a loan at a commercial bank, he came to Kiva Partner MFI, Accion Texas-Louisiana, and was able to secure a loan in enough time to buy the new truck in anticipation of using it to fulfill the needs of a new route. He will pounce on the opportunity to buy a new route from another contractor as soon as one presents itself, he says. With the addition of this route, he will be able to secure a new employee along with the bonus capital, which he will use to finance higher pay for his employees and even more route expansions in the future.\n\nWithout this loan, George says that he might have missed out on the opportunity to purchase his new truck. He hopes, with the help of his loan, to continue serving his New Iberia community with reliable carrier service for years to
