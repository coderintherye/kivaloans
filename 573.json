She wants to buy new land, so that she can increase her production. This is her 10th loan with MFP. She knows that she must make her payments punctually and is ready to do so. With the 1,009 nuevo soles that she has requested, she will buy manure for her land, so that the new plantings will bear good fruit.

is 58 years old, single and has an adult son. He lives with his elderly mother in the district of Pacora, a rural area, and has recently acquired access to electricity and drinking water. His community is small with approximately 200 families. Eduardo earns a living providing show repair services. His business is situated within his house. He has more than 20 years of experience in this trade, which he learned from his father, meaning he knows it perfectly. He is very well-known in the area and has an established clientele. He has continued to invest in his business, which has shown continual growth over the years. \r\n\r\nEduardo has requested a loan of 1,500 PEN to invest in the purchase of materials and equipment that he uses to repair shoes. He would also like to use a part of his credit to make some repairs to the floors, walls and door in the part of his house where he attends to clients. With this investment, he can provide a more professional service to his customers. Eduardo has very good personal and work references. He is a hard-worker and responsible.

B., 54, exerts her best efforts as she manages two micro-businesses at the same time. Her poor educational background of not being able to reach college doesn\u2019t factor much into her current position, considering the amount of entrepreneurial training and Biblical encouragement she receives from CCT*. Victoria is married to Leonardo, part of the maintenance personnel. They have two children; one is in college while the other is in elementary school. They presently reside at Sta. Cruz 1, Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite. \r\n\r\nRunning a \"carinderia\" (food stall) is Victoria\u2019s daily task. Often, she prepares the menu and cooks the meals. She also does the serving, as she has no employees at present. She is quite knowledgeable about her customers\u2019 preferences, based on her seven years of experience in this kind of business. Also, she sells \"Yakult\" (is a Japanese probiotic milk-like product made by fermenting a mixture of skimmed milk with a special strain of the bacterium Lactobacillus casei Shirota) drinks to her neighbors. Altogether, she is able to earn PHP 8,000 as a net income monthly.\r\n\r\nShe exerts another effort to level up her business in terms of applying for a loan amounting to PHP 11,000. This will greatly help her grow her business. It will enable her to purchase quality ingredients and expand the meals she cooks for her customers. Improvement of facilities and utensils will be paid attention to as well. Victoria acknowledges that the loan will impact the profitability of her business and will allow her to save up for future use.\r\n\r\nIt is Victoria\u2019s desire to be successful and for her family to have a better standard of living. That is why no matter how hard the challenges are she strives to give her best efforts to attain the best she can be.

She is 58 years old. Normalita is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Normalita O.'s Group\".\r\n\r\nNormalita is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Normalita owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for breeding. Normalita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Normalita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Normalita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Normalita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 12th loan taken out by Normalita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She buys the animals from her neighbors, who raise and subsequently sell the chickens to the general public at the local market. With the proceeds, she is able to cover her personal expenses and help her parents with the family expenses. She would like to increase her stock by purchasing more animals to sell. For this reason, she thinks that it is opportune to request a  500.00 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa. Maria gives thanks to the Kiva lenders for their support in helping her business grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":742931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase more animals to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":82.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":84.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.14},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":90.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.84,"local_amount":77.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":86.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206138486,"comment":null},{"amount":64.48,"local_amount":161.18,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":181.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210722,"comment":null},{"amount":33.8,"local_amount":84.51,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":95.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488981,"comment":null},{"amount":70.88,"local_amount":177.2,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":199.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181904,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T04:02:48Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287164,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita L., 58, runs her own variety store together with her husband Wyler.

Wilma B., the more blessings one receives, the more that person is enabled to give. Wilma, 47, focuses on making her shop grow but more than that, she sees to it that she does help other people. Wilma is a life partner to Nicomedes, an overseas Filipino worker (OFW), and mother to two children. One studies in high school, while the other is in elementary.  They presently live in Malaria, Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nWilma\u2019s business is two-pronged. First, she is into direct sales. She sells items like clothes and shoes which go along with the taste of the customers. Also, she has a computer shop which she manages. It is located in the extension of their house and profits remarkably. Every month, Wilma earns an estimated net income of around Php 13,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase two sets of computers, so that the shop can accommodate more clients.  Also, with part of this loan, she will purchase some cosmetics ordered in advance by her customers.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season hampers Wilma\u2019s business. Nevertheless, she refuses to be hindered by business challenges from helping others, especially youth. Even as she meets the daily needs of her family, she desires to help others to meet their needs, too. For her, this is the way to become a successful business woman.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":743110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for additional two computer units and cosmetics ordered in advance by customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":190,"local_amount":7999.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8279.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123591,"comment":null},{"amount":126.67,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5519.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194956,"comment":null},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":6666.7,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6899.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474049,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T19:09:08Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287182,"name":"Choem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Choem M. is a 57-year-old village woman who has had a job as a rice farmer since she was single.

She is 51 years old. Florentina is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Florentina S. Group\".\r\n\r\nFlorentina is married and has three children. To make a living, Florentina owns & operates a business venture in the services sector providing waste management services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating tricycle transport waste-management services. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Florentina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florentina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to pay for registration, franchise and licenses. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the 9th loan taken out by Florentina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The official name of this borrowing group is Tita M.'s group.\r\n\r\nTita is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Tita owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Tita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Tita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Tita from ASKI.

C. is from the village of Barucboc. She is 44 years old. Juanita is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is Juanita D. C. Group.\r\n\r\nJuanita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Juanita owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Juanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita is requesting a loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Juanita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Sheryll has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Sheryll is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients to make pork and chicken barbecue to sell. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Sheryll from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":736217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The official name of this borrowing group is Gemma R. Group.\n\nGemma is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma owns & operates a food stall near the school.

Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional soft drinks and bread to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a small entrepreneur who sells groceries. Toir is always on the go. He is very determined and knows how to achieve his goals.\r\n<p> \r\nToir launched his business over three years ago. He and his son have a lot of experience working in this type of trade. Toir\u2019s business is known for its reasonable pricing policy and free delivery service.

He is hoping to use the generated profit to finish remodeling his apartment, which he hasn\u2019t completed due to financial constraints. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International \r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Habibulo wants to sustain his farming business and hopefully grow it so he can eventually have a hectare of farmland to cultivate and provide for the future of his family.  \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She takes advantage of the Sunday fairs in the city of Pichanaki to sell her products because she knows there is great demand for DVDs.  Her business has profitable results.  What she enjoys most about her job is having time to work without neglecting her household duties, thereby allowing her to be independent.  She has been in this business for three years and considers the most difficult part to be carrying her DVDs with her, but she knows that this is part of her job and is willing to do it.  Later on, she wants to open a video store so that she can generate more income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Alejandrina is willing to complete her payments on time because she does not want to cause problems for the other members of her Communal Bank.  She is an active participant in her group.  The loan of 600 PEN that she requested will be used to buy more DVDs so that she can offer her customers a wider variety.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":743418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more DVDs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":631.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850797,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T08:45:36Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287349,"name":"Alejandra Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra Cristina tiene 31 a\u00f1os, por lo que tiene 3 hijos que est\u00e1n a su cargo.

In the beginning he also sold agricultural products.\r\n\r\nJulio Cesar's current goal is to expand his sales of minutes and to invest in buying cell phones because a lot of customers want to upgrade.  In the meantime, Julio Cesar continues offering his telecommunications service which makes him a sales percentage of at least 29%.  He is applying for a Kiva loan (his first through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) because he would like to expand his working capital.  He will use it to buy cell phones and accessories that he has ordered."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":867.82,"image":{"id":743499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cell phones and accessories that he has ordered","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-04-03T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":133209},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":152373},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":155293},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":158270},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":161303},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":164395},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167546},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":170757},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":174030},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":177366},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":180765},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":204693}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.6},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.07},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.06},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.6,"local_amount":133209,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":134443.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230545,"comment":null},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":152373,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":153784.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509394,"comment":null},{"amount":83.47,"local_amount":155293,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":156731.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673615,"comment":null},{"amount":85.07,"local_amount":158270,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":159736.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320174,"comment":null},{"amount":86.7,"local_amount":161303,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":162797.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803308,"comment":null},{"amount":88.36,"local_amount":164395,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":165917.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614391,"comment":null},{"amount":90.06,"local_amount":167546,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":169098.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568360,"comment":null},{"amount":91.78,"local_amount":170757,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":172338.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779703,"comment":null},{"amount":93.54,"local_amount":174030,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175642.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188124,"comment":null},{"amount":95.34,"local_amount":177366,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":179009.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-12T03:03:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287388,"name":"God Bless Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cGod Bless\u201d group.

","en":"M\u00f3nica L. B. is 30 years old and lives in the municipality of San Jacinto in the Bol\u00edvar department. The region is well known in Colombia for its traditional textiles and vertical weaving, a method of weaving on vertical strands of thread on an upright loom. M\u00f3nica is keeping this tradition alive by making handmade backpacks and bags. She generates additional income by preparing and selling Boli (frozen natural fruit juices) and popsicles, and occasionally works as a photographer's assistant. \r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica lives with her husband, who works at a local radio station, and their 7-year-old son. She has high hopes that her son will have a successful career and a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nThis is M\u00f3nica's second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the previous loan, she was able to save money for home improvements and to slightly increase her household income. She plans to invest part of this loan from Kiva in thread, yarn, and accessories for completing backpack orders, and the rest of the loan in repairing the floor of her home, which is in poor condition."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":541.1,"image":{"id":743529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To

Despite having no budget, she manages to buy the goods she sells by the dozen,  so that she can have a great variety of products in her store, which is what her clients demand. That's why she'd like to stock more products for her shop. Eventually she also plans to modify the window bars in her store to increase the space available in her premises so as to be able to sell other products such as school supplies and provide a photocopying service.

She is a very direct, sincere and good woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 64 year-old Hildebrand, and two of her three children.\r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years, Maria has been making and selling tamales.  In the winter she also makes chicken soup and 'picarones' (a type of doughnut) which are sold on a street corner not far from her home.  Her business has done well.  This is how Maria makes her additional income and with her profits, plus your help, she will be able to buy a color television set so that her customers can enjoy themselves while they are eating the dishes that she sells.  Maria also bought a refrigerator which she is paying for in installments.\r\n\r\nMaria carries out her business with a lot of joy and she feels very happy with what she has accomplished.

She lives with 48-year-old Mario with whom she has three children.  They live together in a house that they own.  As a young child, her parents taught her to work the farm.  Zenaida is a farmer and has four hectares of farmland where she grows coffee, cacao, barbasco (an inedible yam) and coca leaves, plants native to the jungle of the Apurimac River Valley.  She has worked on her own lands for eleven years and during the harvest, she hires workers to pick the fruits.  What she likes most about her work is the harvest, as she feels as though the months of hard work pay off with the quality of her fruits.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products from the farm to the centers in the city of San Francisco where they pay her the best prices.  Another difficulty is not having enough income to pay the workers ahead of time for the help they provide during the harvests.  This is why she is turning to the loans provided by MFP.  However, planting more coffee plants is her priority at this point because she has an uncultivated hectare of land.  This is her eighth loan with MFP and she feels that this will help her greatly to progress in her work.  She is very well-liked by her fellow group members at her communal bank, as she is very supportive.  With the 500 Peruvian Nuevos Soles (PEN) requested, she will hire workers to provide support during the

This is a village which is inhabited by Mixtec indigenous people.  It is a village whose inhabitants work making handicrafts on looms such as 'enaguas' (traditional skirts) and napkins.\r\n\r\nThis group has 11 members who all work in different businesses.  Albina and Elana make 'enaguas' (traditional skirts), Rosa and Sofia sell 'antojitos' (traditional Mexican snacks), Juana, Maria and Leonarda sell groceries, Elvira, Gisela and Adela make napkins and Catalino makes pizzas.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is Rosa H. M. who is married to Jacobo Hern\u00e1ndez and has two children who are attending elementary school.  She requested this loan so that she could buy supplies such as corn for making tortillas, meat, tomatoes, chilis, etc. since she sells snacks such as golden chicken tacos, beef tacos and enchiladas in the elementary school in her village.\r\n\r\nAnother of the group's members is Juana Jim\u00e9nez G\u00f3mez who is married to Rogelio H., a farmer.  They have three children who are in school.  Juana's business is making napkins and traditional skirts using a backstrap loom.  This is an activity that she learned when she was very young since it was an inheritance from her ancestors.  It has helped her to cover her family expenses.  This is a very laborious task but the result is very beautiful and her handicrafts are recognized throughout the region.

","en":"This group is called Aldama and is located in the community of Jantetelco, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. It has 5 women members who are neighbours and know each other. Maricela is going to buy blouses, trousers, shirts etc. with her loan. For their business, Ana Mar\u00eda, Irma and Francisca are going to buy catalogue beauty products to sell, and Luc\u00eda will buy tortillas, chicharrones (pork scratchings), cueritos (marinated pork rind), cheese, cream and vegetables for preparing food and selling snacks. Luc\u00eda is a member of the group and is 46 years old. She attended primary school until the 6th year and achieved her secondary education certificate in the INEA. She lives with her common law husband who works in the fields, and they have 2 children: Miguel \u00c1ngel is 22 years old and works, while Ana Miriam is 16 years old and is studying for her Bachilleres (high school qualification). Luc\u00eda runs a food business, and requested her loan in order to buy meat, tortillas, teleras (crusty bread rolls), pork scratchings, marinated pork skins, cheese, cream and vegetables with which to prepare snacks. Her business is opposite the 'Acuario' spa in Jantetelco and from her home she offers her customers tortas (crusty sandwich rolls), prepared pork scratchings, tostadas (topped crispy tortillas), dobladas (folded and stuffed tortillas), sweets and fruit cocktail. Luc\u00cda started her business 20 years ago with a loan provided to her, which she invested in stock. She learnt from her mother who used to sell food, and she used to help her prepare it. Her business is important because it allows her to pay the loan back, eat and provide what her daughter needs for school. She is proud of her business and enjoys preparing the food her mother taught her. When her sales are up, she saves the profits in Banco Azteca for emergencies or illness. She is planning to buy sweets to expand her business and she is hoping to do so with this loan. Her plans and hopes are to move forward through her work, and that her daughter continues studying. Group members would like to give Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad the following message: \"thank you for supporting us with this loan to invest in our business. We will pay it back so that we can receive another, and we thank you in advance for your help\". Jantetelco is a pretty town where they make crystallized sweets like jamoncillo, sweet potato, chilacayote squash, fig and bishop's weed. They also grow sweet potato, maize, beans, sorghum, cucumber and nursery tomatoes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":742758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy meat, tortillas, chicharrones (pork scratchings), cueritos (marinated pork rind), cheese, cream and vegetables for preparing food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JANTETELCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-04-04T08:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10591.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160788,"comment":null},{"amount":443.75,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5295.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233662,"comment":null},{"amount":443.75,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5295.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512481,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T17:01:19Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287432,"name":"Julyssa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julyssa naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco, ella tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene su pareja con quien todav\u00eda no tienen hijos.

She says that she has to get up at 5:00 every morning to begin work because in her community people still eat hand-made tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy fertilizers for her lime trees and also to buy a few replacement pieces and make some repairs to her corn grinder. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":743480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cultivate limes and repair her corn grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Paso Rincon, San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-04-04T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":2500.2,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160815,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":2499.8,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2535.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233689,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2535.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512508,"comment":null},{"amount":102.93,"local_amount":1210.91,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1228.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223159,"comment":null},{"amount":32.1,"local_amount":377.68,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":383.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227202008,"comment":null},{"amount":77.47,"local_amount":911.41,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":924.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807762,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-04T19:49:40Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":287496,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\nEn la Cuenca del Papaluapan existe una comunidad llamada Paso Rincon la cual se caracteriza por ser productora de limon, en este lugar existe la costumbre de que toda la familia trabaja en la cosecha desde los hijos hasta los padres y abuelos.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Rosa R.

This is also the place where the famous Panama hats are made.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the group have participated in two loan cycles.  They formed this Communal Bank and are committed to staying together as long as the loans improve their standard of living.  The members engage in different business activities involving trade, services, and crafts.  They also have factory jobs in the city of Manta.  \r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place that one can find Sra. Guignia Esmerida R..  She is 45 years old, married, and has four children.  Three are grown and the youngest child is a 17 year old daughter who still lives with her.

In her store, she sells rice, sugar, oil, detergents, sausages, meat, chicken, fish, and other products.  She works every day from 6am to 8pm, and sometimes much later.  Her daughter occasionally helps with her business.  Guignia buys her products in Manta and most of them are delivered to her store.  She says that her store has been open for five years and her bar has been in existence for one year.  Both businesses are doing well.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to increase the inventory of her store.  She will buy rice, sugar, oil, beverages, and other products.

The community in which the members live is quite beautiful because of the variety of animal and plant life that exists.  In addition, there is a river that runs through the town.  There are eleven members in the group who engage in the following activities:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tAura sells automobile cleaning products.\r\n\u2022\tHortencia and Mar\u00eda sell snacks.\r\n\u2022\tCirila, Vianey, and Sara sell products through catalogs.\r\n\u2022\tHerminia prepares and sells tortillas.\r\n\u2022\tYsaura sells natural medicines and dinnerware.\r\n\u2022\tNatividad sells household goods.\r\n\u2022\tSocorro sells fish and soft drinks.\r\n\u2022\tHortencia sells tamales.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group representative is Sra. Hortencia S. A..  She is in a common law marriage with Sr. F\u00e9lix Raviera.  They have five children who are either high school or elementary school students.  Hortencia sells snacks such as tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, and \u201csopes\u201d (fried tortillas topped with refried beans, onions, and hot sauce).  She started this business fourteen years ago out of necessity because her husband did not have a job and they were in need of money.  For this reason, she started a small business.  Hortencia is requesting a loan to buy more supplies such as meat, vegetables, and other products that she needs.  With her earnings, she is able to sustain her family and provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother member of the group is Sra. Socorro.  Even though she is an elderly woman, Socorro works every day to provide for her daily needs.  She is single and has a grandson that she has been supporting since he was little.  Socorro is an admirable woman who knows how to press forward despite her age and the number of illnesses she has had to endure.  She currently suffers from hearing loss, but she does not let this impediment keep her from working and getting ahead.  Socorro has a small business in her home where she sells fish and soft drinks.  She is requesting a loan to buy more products because she is out of inventory and does not have sufficient funds to acquire more.

Do\u00f1a Petrita is well-known in her town, and she has been engaging in selling bread for more than 40 years. She says she sells her bread door to door, and that sometimes she receives orders. She is a widow and she lives alone. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy firewood and bags, flour, sugar, dough, eggs and milk to prepare bread. She aims at gaining more customers for her activity as well as making herself known in the big cities. She plans on saving the money she will earn, in order to buy wood and sheet steel to add a roof outside her house where to sell her bread.

The official name of this borrowing group is 4 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.05.4 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 ).\r\n\r\n\r\nTuy\u1ebft  is married and has one school-aged child.  To making a living, Tuy\u1ebft  owns & operates a general store selling  products for daily use, such as shampoo, soap, & toothpaste.  Tuy\u1ebft  has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tuy\u1ebft  joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tuy\u1ebft  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,159,600 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Tuy\u1ebft  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

In this village there is a group called 'L. Abundancia' (Abundance).  They chose this name because they live in a region that produces a lot of sugar.\r\n\r\n20 year-old Silvia is one of the members of this group.  Silvia has only an elementary school level of education and in a few months time she will become a single mother.  For this reason, she decided to start working in her own business selling fast food, Mexican snacks (stuffed chilis, tamales, empanadas, stuffed corn cakes, tacos and sandwiches) and pizza.  She makes her sales door to door to her friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nSilvia hopes that this investment will increase her sales because she tells us that she has premises in her home in which, in the future, she would like to set up her business.\r\n\r\nCiriL. is another member of the 'L. Abundancia' group.  She is 56 years old and tells us that she started her business selling meals more than a year ago because her husband's earnings didn't stretch far enough to cover all their household expenses.\r\n\r\nCirilia provides lunches to some of the day laborers in her community and she tells us that in the future she would like to set up a small inn where she could sell her meals not only to the workers but also to anybody else who would like to eat there.  She would also like to invest a little in making sweet treats.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group need a loan to invest in buying supplies (cabbage, tomatoes, chilis, onions, beans, meat, cream, cheese, tortillas, corn, eggs, rice, bananas, potatoes, oil and gas) with which to make their meals that they will then sell.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are: Jose Domingo, Guadalupe, AdeL., Alejandro, Albina, Ceferina, Maria Alba and Patricia (who everyone calls Paty).
