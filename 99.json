She used her loans to raise pigs which yielded good profit so she continues to do so in later rounds of loans. Her husband, Mr M., works as a laborer and he helps her taking care of the weekly payment. The revenue from the pig business is sufficient to provide education for their children: their eldest son has graduated and the other 3 are still in high school and primary school.

After a year, things went well for her: it was easy to make the weekly payment and her family income has increased. So Mrs Ngh\u0129a  started to take out bigger loans. After 3 years, she has been able to buy all the basic goods for her household and also a motorcycle. Her family income from the fishing business is 100-130 USD a month. She also exploits her rice paddle and raises livestock to increase her income. This time she is seeking 375 USD to buy fishing net and tools.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb Ngh\u0129a, 55 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 c\u00e1c con t\u1ea1i Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng, Thanh H\u00f3a.

Her family has 5 members: the parents and 3 grown-up children. Before, her main activities were working on the field and breeding animals. Mr. Thiem, her husband, bought the pigs and sold the pork to retailers. Three years ago, Mrs. L. borrowed money so that her husband could buy more pigs and sold pork to not only food shops but also local people. Mrs.L. \u2018s pork is very popular and therefore, her income increases. Currently, her average income is 200 USD\/ month from selling pork.

Even though she already had 1 hectare of field, she wanted to buy more land for sedge cultivation. She decided to borrow 375 USD to buy land to plant sedge. She calculated, after harvest, her average profit from the sedge is 120 USD. The profit is high, and she also has good material for weaving sedge mats. Currently, the main activity for Mrs. D. and her husband is to weave sedge mats. Their average income is 150 USD\/month. Besides being able to send the children to schools, she was able to buy a new TV and a closet last year. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Di\u1ec7n, 33 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2003.

Among her three children, two of them are still at school age.  H. and her husband plant sedges.  After each harvest, they sold the short and not-quite good sedges, and keep the good ones to make sedge mats.  Good materials and Mrs. H.'s cleverness bring beautiful mats, and all of the mats made are sold very quickly at good prices.  After joining TYM Fund, Mrs. H. has more money, so she is able to make more sedge mats.  Each day she makes 4 to 5 sedge mats.  Her income is about 6 USD per day, which is a huge improvement compared to what she earned before joining TYM Fund.  Mrs. H. was able to buy a closet, a T.V. and other furniture for her house.  This time she applies for a loan of 575 USD to buy sedge to make sedge mats.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1ea3i, 43 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean tham gia n\u0103m th\u1ee9 5 c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng. 2 trong s\u1ed1 3 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con c\u1ee7a ch\u1ecb hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang trong \u0111\u1ed9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u1ebfn tr\u01b0\u1eddng.

Since Ms. M. joined TYM Fund (KIva Partner in Vietnam), she has more fund to buy materials.  Thus, she is able to make more mats and the profit also increases accordingly.  After 4 years, Ms. M. is able to rebuild her house.  Each month her income is about 130 USD.  Ms. M. told us what she thinks about TYM Fund and microcredit: \"I was able to borrow money, give back the repayments, improve my income, and above all, my child is able to go to school and get a better life.\"  This time she wants to borrow 450 USD to buy more sedges and to invest on breeding poultry.

She has a boyfriend and a 3-year-old daughter. \r\n<p>\r\nJulieta moved with her family to Matola, a village 15Km away from the capital city Maputo, when young. She studied until 7th grade and stopped in 1993 because she moved to South Africa to live with her sister. Julieta lived in South Africa until 2005, and there she worked with commerce, selling products and food in the street. Julieta met her boyfriend and moved in with him a few months later. Julieta decided to come back to Mozambique because according to her \u201clife in Mozambique is prettier and nicer\u201d. She has a small stand in the street where she sells food, such as tomatoes, rice, peanut, onions and garlic. Julieta makes between MTn 500 to MTn 1,000 per day. Julieta\u2019s best business is the wholesale products of things she brings from South Africa. Julieta goes to South Africa at least once a month and brings many products that clients request and others that she knows she will easily sell, such as crackers. Julieta has to accumulate at least 3,000 Rands to make sure she can buy enough products, pay the transport and also the customs duties. Every 3 months Julieta benefits from her business in South Africa and goes visit her boyfriend who still lives there.\r\n<p>\r\nTogether with her boyfriend (a Mozambican man from Maputo), Julieta bought land in Matola and started to build a house. The first MTn 8,000 loan with Hluvuku was used to pay half of the salary of the construction workers. They were asking MTn 16,000 and Julieta just had half of the money, and preferred to use a known institution than any man in the street. With this second loan of MTn 10,500 Julieta plans to continue building her house. She will buy windows, doors and 10 aluminum-roofing plaques to finish the bedrooms and the living room.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Julieta would like to get married (officially), finish her house with a bathroom and build a fence around her house. Julieta would also like to build a proper general store to sell many products and increase her daily

Lucia is married and has 5 children aging 15 to 1 years old. Lucia studied until 5th grade and stopped after the Mozambican civil war started, never returning to school again.\r\n<p>\r\nLucia has been working selling products for many years now. Since 2000 she has had a small stand at the Boane\u2019s central market where she sells food, such as tomatoes, onions, garlic, peanuts, coconut and basic products such as oil and soap. Tomatoes and oil are Lucia\u2019s best products. She buys the products in Maputo, going 3 times a week by public transportation. Lucia buys a box of tomatoes for MTn 250 and sells 4 for MTn 5. Lucia makes around MTn 800 per day, at the end of the month she makes up to MTn 1,200 in a single day. Lucia\u2019s husband works at their own machamba (small agricultural field) and helps with the household expenses and the children\u2019s school fees.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Lucia\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first one with Kiva. The first MTn 5,000 was used to buy merchandise and increase the products sold at the stand, attracting more clients and increasing her daily sales. The second MTn 10,000 was used to buy cement to keep helping with the construction of her new house. Lucia currently lives at a small house with her family, but is already building a bigger house on land they have recently bought. Lucia intends to use this MTn 10,000 to buy merchandise, possibly diversifying the products offered at her stand, and if money allows buy some bricks and more cement to continue the construction of her house.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Lucia would like to build a small henhouse at her new house\u2019s backyard so that she can raise chicks and sell them, improving her household income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe

K. is a head teacher at Weslean Primary School in Makeni town of Sierra Leone.  He has been teaching for 31 years but the salary is insufficient to enable him to build a family house.

Her husband passed away when her 2 children are still very little. Her life at that time was very difficult for her. Since her family did not own any valuable properties, she could not loan money from the banks. When the TYM Fund came to her area, Mrs. T. enthusiastically joined and borrowed money. The borrowed money is mainly used in buying sedge to weave mats. Her painstaking character together with a convenient working mechanism of TYM Fund make ways for her family economy to improve. After 5 years of participation, Mrs. T. saved enough money to build a well-furnished house with TV, fan, etc. Her current average income is 150 USD\/ month.

She spends her profit in sending her children to school and to furnish her house. Last time, Mrs. S. borrowed 375 USD.

She has a husband and two children.  Her first loan of 70USD was used to brew wine. After the first year, her profit was 100USD. In those next three years, she continued to take loans to brew wine and breeding pigs.  Last year, she was able to rebuild her house.  Now the price of materials for construction work is increasing, so Mrs. Q. discussed with her husband to borrow 950USD to buy some land and produce bricks.  This new job will bring more profit, yet it requires a lot of investment.  Mrs. Q. hopes that she will be able to borrow bigger loan in the next years.

The earnings from the kiosk is used to supplement her husband's income.  Her husband, Nengah Jasa, works as a truck driver in the Javanese route.  Since her husband's income is barely enough to cover daily living expenses, Rani started a kiosk with starting capital of $110.  Rani stocks her kiosk with merchandises like snacks, foods, drinks and others.  Rani opens her kiosk at 6 am and closes at 6pm.  Each morning, Rani goes tot he market to purchase goods to be sold.  She goes to the market at 5 am every day.  The market is not too far from her home.  She earns about $55 each day.  Rani saves her earnings for later days.  All her children has been married.

Untuk membantu suaminya , Nengah Jasa, yang bekerja sebagai sopir truk ke Jawa . Karena Penghasilannya sebagai sopir tidak mencukupi untuk kebutuhan ekonominya. Maka Rani membantu dengan membuka warung di rumahnya.Dengan modal awal Rp.1.000.000,- Rani melengkapi isi warungnya dengan bermacam-macam barang dagangan seperti makanan, minuman,sembako ,snak,dan lain-lain. Rani membuka warungnya pada pagi hari jam 6 pagi sampai sore jam 6 sore. Setiap pagi Rani juga pergi ke pasar untuk membeli keperluan dagangannya,sekitar pukul 5 pagi,karena rumahnya dekat dengan pasar negara. Keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar Rp.50.000,- perhari, Rani bisa mempergunakan untuk memenuhi kebutuhannya sehari-hari ,karena kebutuhan sembako harganya sangat mahal sekarang ini,maka Rani juga harus bisa menabung untuk masa depannya,karena anak-anaknya sudah semua menikah dan tinggal bersama suaminya. Pinjaman yang diperoleh dari Dinari dipakai untuk menambah modal usahanya agar dagangannya semakin banyak dan

The same thing happens with the young people in our village who also go to the town looking to connect to the internet. Since there is great demand for the internet, we would like to ask for your help in creating a cybercaf\u00e9 in the village which would fill the current gap in information technology in our area. Ever since our village got wired for electricity and connected to the telephone network, we have been looking to open a cybercaf\u00e9, not only in order to create jobs, but to take part in the development of our locality by allowing the populace access to information via modern communication technology. For this reason we have established two groups, each having the same objective.

With this new loan, which will be repaid within 4 months, she will purchase different types of clothing for women, men and children.

She joined TYM Fund in 2007. Her husband is a carpenter and while his income is steady and stable, she wishes to not be so reliant on her husband for financial support. Aside from working in her shop she is also a seamstress. Although enduring a painstaking craft, her skillful hands produce beautiful merchandise, which attracts many customers. Already in her second year of participation with the Fund, she finds that the loan repayment terms are very agreeable and convenient for her family. With the family income increasing and her children allowed greater education, she has noticed that her children are very well-behaved and receives high grades in school. Her monthly family income is around 200USD. This time around, she requests a loan of 575USD to buy  more goods for her small convenience store and more carpentry wood for her husband. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Trinh Quoc Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay, 35 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2007.

They earn a little more than $3 (US) per day through this business. They have three children together, all of whom are students. The family also raises cows, which the children are responsible for caring for when they come home from school each day. Their business loan will go towards supporting both of these sources of income for the family. Half the loan will be used to buy two females cows for breeding purposes.

A. lives in the town of Vahdat. He is married and has 3 children. He has secondary education and was trained as salesman. He started his own business by opening a grocery store close to his home. He imports his inventory. However, he would like to offer not only food, but also a number of other products needed in households. To increase the assortment of his goods and purchase additional inventory he needs funds. Expansion of his store will also help local residents purchase all of the necessities in their town without leaving it.  For this reason, he decided to apply for a loan, which will help him achieve his goals. He plans to pay off the credit within the next 10 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

Ergashevna M. lives in the city of Tursun-Zoda. She is 21 years old and has a high school degree. Matluba has a small bakery at the local market of Tursun-Zoda where she bakes rolls and filled savory pastries (pirozhki). Her parents are old and she is their sole supporter. Currently the prices for flour have been rising steadily and Matluba decided to purchase a large batch of flour from the wholesalers to keep the price of her baked goods low. To purchase a large batch of flour Matluba needs money and that is why she wants to take out this loan. She is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva
