He is 31 year old and lives with his wife and 2 year old daughter who doesn't go to school yet. He finished 9th grade but had to drop school to start working. He lives in a rented house with his wife and daughter plus a niece that lives with them. He never left his hometown, and he has been working for the past 15 years at Hotel Libombos as a waiter daily either from 7AM to 3PM or from 3PM TO 11PM, and he makes around U$100 per month, that he uses to support his family and tries to save, since his wife works too.\r\n\r\nHe never had loans with other banks and he's asking for U$450, which she will use to try to get himself a piece of land. He's committed to pay that loan back so he can ask for more in the future and start building his house, so he won't need to rent any longer.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

N. was born in Changalane, a town about 38km from Namaacha, Maputo Province, Mozambique. She is 41 years old and has 3 children with ages between 6 and 19, all of them students. She lives with her own house with her family and also helps her mother by sending her U$90 every month. \r\nMarta owns a grocery store. In previous days she owned a tractor and worked in the farms where she was able to save some money to start her own business; later on there was some family dispute over her late father-in-law's properties, and she ended up declaring bankrupcy. She heard of Kiva from a cousin and she's asking for a U$600 loan, which she will use to improve her business. \r\nShe travels once a month to get more products for her store, and her best selling products are sugar, rice and beverages. She makes about U$175 per month and she's been able to save U$40 every month. She counts with the help of her husband who own 32 cows. \r\nThis is Marta's third loan and she's using it to buy more merchandise like sugar, rice, flour, beverages and others, so she can sell more and have more profit. She's confident she will be able to pay the loan back before the deadline, and ask for a new loan to expand even more her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is 63 years old, is married, and has seven children between the ages of 10 and 40.  Only the three youngest attend school.  Alberto finished sixth grade in the old educational system; he did not continue because of financial difficulties.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nAlberto found work as a cargo loader for STIVA, and because of his dedication and willpower he was promoted to manager.  He worked there for 20 years, receiving 25,000 meticais monthly, but when he was informed that he would be retiring he immediately built a market stall in his house.  Today he is retired and receives 8,5000 meticais monthly, which does not meet his needs.  He spoke with his wife, who is a customer of Hluvuku, about our services and approached us to request a loan of 15,000 meticais to stock his business.  His business is important because he supplies basic products to the community, reducing the distances people used to have to travel for the same items.  Alberto travels once a week because he is the only one with a market stall and because he also has transportation.  He makes 2,500 meticais in profits and manages to save 1,000 meticais, which will help greatly in tough times for his business.\r\n\r\nThis is Alberto's second loan with Hluvuku and Kiva.  With this 15,000 meticais loan, he intends to buy products for his stall (peanuts, beans, sardines, pasta).  The previous 15,000 meticais loan was used to increase his inventory.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan ahead of schedule and ask for another loan to begin raising chickens.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":544840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of peanuts, beans, sardines, pasta","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto Miomo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":203068,"name":"Kyarutanga Twetungura, Ibanda Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Putting up his hand at the extreme left is A.

B. is from the village of Agoho, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 51 years old. Lurcille is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Lurcille owns & operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Lurcille has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lurcille joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lurcille has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Lurcille is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Lurcille from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":544842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Presently he is the father of three children. Yakubjon must continue providing them with the conditions necessary for their scholastic development.\r\n<p>\r\nHis reason for coming to IMON International is to obtain a loan with which he will buy seeds and fertilizers for his crops. Yakubjon and his family will benefit a lot from this loan, and so he is waiting for his request to be granted, and in this way he will have the financial capital to continue with his business in agriculture.  \r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is 32 years old, is married, and has two children who are 3 and 8 years old.  The eldest goes to school.  Ab\u00edlio finished seventh grade but did not continue because of financial problems.  He lives in his own house and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nAb\u00edlio has never left this District and lives with his wife.  He owns a mechanic's shop which is in his house, and he relies on the help of two employees who each receive 2,000 meticais per month.  To increase his family's income, he used his savings to open a shop where he sells basic items, namely beans, rice, peanuts, crackers, flour and some refrigerated products.  He works from 7:00 am until 8:00 pm and makes a profit of 5,000 to 6,000 meticais, which he uses for household expenses and for work.  He approached Hluvuku and Kiva to ask for a loan to add to the products he now carries and meet his customers' needs during the time of pilgrimage (a religious ceremony that takes place annually).\r\n\r\nThis is Ab\u00edlio's second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 12,000 meticais was used to buy agricultural supplies for his machamba (a large garden or small field).  These 15,000 meticais will be used to increase his inventory and meet the needs of the pilgrims.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan ahead of schedule and ask for another to begin building a chicken coop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Many vehicles from other cities pass through Palmar de Varela on their way to other regions within Colombia.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":539296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase bicycle & motorcycle parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Palmar de Varela (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tibisay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66572},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75598},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77173},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78780},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80422},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82097},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83807},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85553},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87336},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89155},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91013},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102494}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.95,"local_amount":66572,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":69512.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636205,"comment":null},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":75598,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":78937.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850300,"comment":null},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":68492,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71517.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688187,"comment":null},{"amount":414.4,"local_amount":789338,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":824205.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427424,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-27T04:31:28Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":203127,"name":"Kipkorir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kipkorir is 25 years old.

Based on his understanding of the retail perfume business and his talent for working with the public, he knew he could run a successful perfume store.  He even knew where he wanted to open his store - in a kiosk at a mall.  But this Brazilian native wanted to be smart about financing his business.\r\n\r\nRonieri could have used credit cards to finance the purchase of his new kiosk and his initial inventory, but he was well aware of the high interest rate he'd have to pay.  So he contacted a government loan program and began their loan application process.  Unfortunately, they weren't used to dealing with a smaller retail start-up business, and asked for mountains of paperwork and documentation.  Ronieri was getting frustrated by the time and effort required to borrow money.\r\n\r\nThen he decided to contact ACCION USA.  Since he had so much of his paperwork already in order, his loan approval was quite quick.  He set-up his kiosk and has already hired part-time help.  Ronieri is hoping, one day, to expand into a storefront in the same mall.  When he does, he hopes to have another positive experience working with ACCION USA to get his financing.\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA: \r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

This young man of twenty-eight years sells goods, and he also has a kiosk where he sells cell phone minutes.  Selling cell phone minutes is quite common in this area.  He's a very active young businessman, always on the lookout for opportunities. Thanks to the hot climate he can also sell men\u2019s and women\u2019s sandals.  In addition, he makes pandebonos (a bread made with cheese and corn meal) in his and his brother\u2019s oven, and sells them on the street.  \r\n\r\nDavid has applied for this loan so he can buy more merchandise.  He plans to get four dozen pairs of men\u2019s sandals and four dozen pairs of women\u2019s sandals that he has orders for, as well as a sack of meal, twenty-four pounds of cheese, and assorted ingredients for his pandebonos business.\r\n\r\nDavid went into business twelve years ago by getting pandebonos from the supplier and selling them on the street.  He says it was hard at first because he didn\u2019t have enough capital and the work was hard, so he really had to sacrifice to keep it going.  He kept on saving and managed to buy his own oven, in concert with his brother.  Later, with his new savings, he started bringing hand-made sandals from San Jacinto, a municipality in Bolivia, to distribute in the towns of the Atl\u00e1ntico department.  He added yet another business to increase his income: selling clothing and other goods, and he even succeeded in putting a cell-phone-minutes kiosk in his house so his wife could work.\r\n\r\nThis is David\u2019s second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Since starting out with the organization he has been able to open new markets and expand the range of products that he offers.  Looking to the future, he hopes to continue working to improve the quality of life for himself and his family by getting their own house, his greatest dream and biggest challenge.

La zona se encuentra ubicada a una hora de camino de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica desde hace mas de cuatro a\u00f1os a la crianza y venta de animales: ella cr\u00eda aves de corral y ganado ovino en la parte posterior de su domicilio, los alimenta con polvillo y pastos naturales y cuando ya han alcanzado un buen punto de desarrollo los vende a los negociantes que visitan el lugar semanalmente. Eventualmente Santos tambi\u00e9n vende pollos para consumo a las personas que tienen bodegas por la zona y tambi\u00e9n verduras que compra a los agricultores del lugar para venderlas en las tiendas del pueblo.\n\nLos ingresos que percibe de estas actividades son utilizados para ayudar a su esposo, que es agricultor, en el sostenimiento econ\u00f3mico de su familia. Santos desea comprar alimento balanceado para mejorar la crianza de sus animales y percibir mas ganancias al momento de venderlos, por ello ha solicitado a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles.\n\nSantos es una mujer activa y que distribuye su tiempo entre las labores de su vivienda y en su trabajo, ella desea crecer como empresaria y seguir apoyando a su esposo en el sostenimiento de su hogar.

The district is located in Lambayeque Province, which is an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nSantos has been raising and selling animals for more than four years.  She has a pen for raising poultry and also has a designated area behind her house for raising pigs.  Her animals are fed ground meal and natural grasses to ensure their development so that they can be sold to the merchants who pass through the village on a weekly basis.  Santos also sells chickens to store owners in the area and is a vegetable broker who buys crops from the farmers and sells them to the stores in town.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe earnings from her business activities are used to help her husband, who is farmer, maintain the family\u2019s finances.  Santos wants to buy balanced feed to improve the growth of her animals so that she can generate more income when it is time to sell them.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2000 PEN.\r\n<p>\r\nSantos is an active woman who divides her time between her household activities and her work.  She wants to grow as a businesswoman and continue supporting her husband with the household maintenance.  Santos has worked previously with Edpyme Alternativa and demonstrated that she is prompt and responsible when submitting her payments.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":545279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"El Romero -

E. is from the village of Yumbing, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 41 years old. Emely is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Emely owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business is the sale of Avon, Fullerlife, and Natasha products in the local community. Emely has been engaged in her business for over 12 years, and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from these activities. She also has a food stall, where she sells specialty foods and snack foods.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Emely joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and ability to engage in business activities. Emely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Emely is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Emely from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:<br>\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

The official name of this borrowing group is 02.09.05 Hoang Hoa (02.09.05 Hoang Hoa).\r\n\r\nNgoi is married and has three adult children. Ngoi operates a family member's livestock business. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale. Ngoi has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 700,000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Ngoi joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Ngoi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. She is now requesting a new loan, her fifth, of 5,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Ngoi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1. L. T.

T. (79) is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Hoang Hoa, Thanh Hoa.  Tham is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 04.10.06 Hoang Hoa  (04.10.06 Hoang Hoa).\r\n\r\nTham is married and has 3 children.  To make a living, Tham owns & operates a business venture making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community.  Tham has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 2.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Tham joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tham has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  This will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Tham plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  N. T.

Vivian S. B. is from the village of P1 Gango, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 53 years old. Vivian is married and has five children -- three are grown up and two are teenagers.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Vivian owns and operates a business making and selling snacks. She makes a snack called \"Biko,\" which is a rice cake made from Malagkit rice. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vivian joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.\r\n\r\nVivian is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers for her family's riceland. The remaining amount will be used as additional capital for her Biko-making business. Vivian plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. She will use some of the revenue to meet her family's basic needs, and save some for future use and house renovations.\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n <b>Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. was born on January 7, 1952 in Parakou, in the North of Benin. She is married to Henry Yango and is the mother of three children, all of whom go to school. However, none of the children are dependent on her. Evelyne lives by herself and supports herself independently. About a dozen years ago, she moved to the Allomey district in Allada, in the Atlantic Prefecture of Benin. She has been selling ice cream and soft drinks in Allada for about five years. As a secondary business activity, she also sells jewelry. She purchases her goods in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Evelyne has already been a client of ALID\u00e9 in the past: she had obtained three loans, all of which were duly repaid.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC, and is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. This will be Catalina\u2019s 10th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: \n\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":552595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.  \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rosario joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be Rosario\u2019s 1st loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

T. is from the village of Iniawan, Poblacion, Kadingilan Bukidnon. She is 32 years old. Retchel is married and has an infant. To make a living, Retchel raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Retchel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Retchel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Retchel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise. \r\n\r\nRetchel is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional piglets to raise. This will be the second loan taken out by Retchel from HSPFI.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the future success of her business, Amelita has applied for a PHP 9,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying raw ingredients needed for her recipes.

H., 35, is making sure that her family members have enough to fulfill their daily needs.

She has been managing her own ice cream business while selling sticky rice cakes as a sideline.\r\n\r\nAna has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends the group's weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she has been able to borrow several times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is able to pay her dues consistently because she used her previous loans to expand and improve her ice cream and sticky rice business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Ana would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This will be used as added capital for her expanding business so that she can buy ingredients needed to continue production of her sticky rice cakes.

She has been managing her own direct selling business for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nTeresita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her direct selling business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 17,000 Philippine peso (PHP) loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying advance orders of toiletries, cosmetics and clothing that have been ordered by her customers.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Cristina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Cristina from HSPFI.
