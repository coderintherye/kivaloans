As they are old, he is lovingly caring for them in his own house, located in the town of Yapaz Bajo, San Luis de Shuaro district - Chanchamayo. Elvis has one son, Airton, of 17 years of age. Although they don't live together, Elvis loves him and does everything possible to provide him with a high quality of life. \r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that, 15 years ago, Elvis bought 10 hectares of land, where he plants coffee and bananas in large quantities. What he likes most about agriculture is being in the fields, growing and taking care of the plants that will soon bear fruits. During the harvest season Elvis stocks up coffee, thus he buys and sells to a production company. This way he gains extra money, on top of trading his own beans. \r\n\r\nBut the activity on which he spends most of his time is his shop of internet booths, phone booths, and movie showing booths. He is doing very well, as there isn't any other such shop in the area; he is the only one in this trade. For that, he is thinking every day on how to improve customer support and the level of service.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his fifth loan received from MFP. Elvis counts on its collaboration to be able to realize his plans. He commits, one more time, to fulfill the payment for his installments, as he did with his previous loans. He is also pleased to be a member of his communal bank \"El Palomar al \u00c9xito\", as all its members are responsible people.  \r\n\r\nElvis, when obtaining this support, will invest the requested money into paying for his machines' maintenance. He will also buy some sacks of organic compost, to fertilize his coffee plantation.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1018024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for his machines' maintenance and to buy sacks of compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-01T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-01T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-02T22:19:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403317,"name":"Ing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ing and his wife are farmers.

Before starting to sell fabric, Khady sold bread from her home. As the profit from selling bread was very low, she switched to a different business in the hope of increasing her earnings. So she began selling women's accessories: fabric, shoes, bags, etc. She has been involved in this activity for six years. Khady has already received a loan of 100,000 CFA francs, and is asking for an increase of 50,000 francs in order to gradually expand her business.

His responsibilities include looking after his two beloved children, as things worked out so that he has been a widower for a year. Now what he most wants is to be able to give his children a better quality of life. Lidio is a man who earns a profit. He carefully tends his coffee plantations, work that he has been doing for more than 30 years. During harvest time he has the help of daily laborers, and so he can rapidly harvest the beans and then sell them in the center where all the farmers take their coffee. Here he gets a good return on every kilo of coffee. The difficult thing for him is to transport his sacks of coffee beans to the collection center where the buyers congregate. In time, he wants to buy more cocoa and coffee plants to increase his plantings and he is prioritizing buying these as they will bring him good returns in his next harvests and he will use the profits to give his children a good life. This will be his fourth loan from MFP. He is very happy with the confidence they have shown in him and is ready to make his monthly repayments as this will enable him to access other loans.

She is Alejandro\u2019s wife, and he is 42 years old. They are the parents of two beautiful daughters, Tania who is 18 years old and Maydelin who is 8 years old. They live in their own home. Claudia is an optimistic woman and always thinking of her family. \r\n\r\nSome time ago she considered opening a ceviche stand in her neighborhood to offer a good service. She began fixing up her facility so that she could make a good appearance and attract the attention of people, and now, since then, she has the help of her husband and both are dedicated to giving her customers good service.\r\n\r\nShe is in her stand very early and people passing by always get to try the tasty rich ceviche with a drink. This is how Claudia attends to her customers and why people always return to Claudia\u2019s Ceviche Stand.\r\n\r\nAt first she began with few supplies for her business and now with the loan she is requesting she will be able to buy some supplies that she lacks in her ceviche stand. This will be her sixth loan through MFP. She is ready to make her payments punctually in order to request another loan. She is a trustworthy member of her communal bank and united with her partners. With the 2,500 soles, she will buy plates and serving dishes and everything necessary for her food stand."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1018811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy plates and serving dishes for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":216.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":218.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":226.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":236.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":245.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":252.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":280.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":289.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402147,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad, 35 years old and a single man, now lives with his mother after his father passed away. \r\n\r\nMohammad has his own business which is a humble store selling all sorts of home products, whether it be for kitchen or for the living room or even decoration pieces.

Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Albeiro busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de un caballo para transportar sus productos y no tenerlos que cargar en su hombro hasta el sitio donde los entrega a sus clientes.\n\nAlbeiro espera que de esta manera pueda transportar de mejor manera sus productos, y as\u00ed pueda conservar su salud.

From a very young age, he learned the work of the fields, since his parents always worked at this activity and they rapidly taught it to Albeiro. When his father died, he inherited the land where he now raises a great variety of fruits, and thanks to this he generates the income necessary to sustain his household. Albeiro is married and is the father of three children, to whom he has always wanted to offer a good education. In his business, he has a large number of customers, who guarantee him a very good level of sales. Nevertheless, Albeiro has the difficulty that he needs to deliver his products to his customers at a location that is very far from where he grows his products, and for this reason he has to carry them on his shoulders for a long time. Because of this, Albeiro has already experienced some health problems. With the spirit to improve this situation, Albeiro is seeking a loan, which will offer him the possibility of being able to purchase a horse to transport his products so that he won't have to carry them on his shoulders to the place where he delivers them to his customers.\r\n\r\nAlbeiro hopes that in this way he can transport his products in a better way, and thus he can preserve his health.

Doris learned this trade working in a dressmaking enterprise where after lengthy employment, she decided to become independent, as suggested by her husband, and began  working independently from her home. From this point on, Doris was able to combine dressmaking with her house work and increased her income considerably. This resulted in her family having a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nSince her shop began with very limited resources, Doris is seeking a loan that will allow her to buy dressmaking supplies such as thread, cloth, and buttons, among other things, and to perform maintenance on one of her sewing machines. \r\n\r\nThanks to the loan, Doris will be able to continue offering services of high quality to her customers, and will earn a larger income for her household.

She sends money to the city of Lima and from there, they send products which she attempts to sell in her city among friends and neighbors. Cherli has been working for some 9 years on her own, and she has built up a very good customer list. Some 6 months ago she began selling groceries and the new investment is going well.\r\n\r\nCherli likes the work very much since it leaves her time for other activities. What she doesn't like is that at times, people delay paying. But she always has customers and the good thing is that since she now has years devoted to the business, she knows who to give credit to and who not to. Cherli would like, later on, to establish a silver and gold jewelry store in the city.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 5th loan through MFP. Cherli is very content to know that she will have financial aid, since she will feel more secure advancing her business. Once again, she is committed to complying with her schedule of payments, as she has with previous loans. In addition, Cherli is very content to belong to her communal bank, since everyone is very responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,800 new sols requested, Cherli will purchase more silver jewelry, because she wants to keep her customers in style, and she will buy some groceries to continue in that business.

She has been doing this work for six years already and she is very well known.\r\n\r\n\"My children are growing up and I want them to study in a recognized university,\" she says.  This is why she works very hard.  But she does not feel alone because she receives the support of her husband, who works as an electrician in a well-known mine.  She has to go home every 20 days because her husband arrives to spend time with the family.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the La Florida solidarity group and this is her tenth loan with MFP, where she feels empowered because she gets the help to get ahead with her business.  This is why she promises to be punctual in making her payments.  In addition, she likes to work in her bank because they are responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nIf she receives her support, Mirtha will invest the requesting money in buying merchandise to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1019501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy floor tiles as well as lingerie.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T14:40:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirtha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":249.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":252.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":268.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":273.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":295.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":303.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":317.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":347.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":359.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399412,"name":"Blanca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca, de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer empe\u00f1osa y trabajadora, adem\u00e1s de ser amable y cordial, es separada del padre de su hija de 7 a\u00f1os de edad.

Her average production is 1,500 chickens every 45 days, which is the average time needed to raise the chicks to be ready for market. She has dome this job for approximately 5 years and it is something she learned little by little. She likes her work because it gives her time to do more things. She only uses half the day to be in her sheds and the rest of the day she is at home with her children helping them with anything they need. Every day she is more convinced that the work she does is good, since she has a lot of regular customers who wait for her monthly production because her chickens are big, plump and healthy. Now she is preparing to have one more shed and she is convinced that with her hard work she will keep growing. This will be her 13th loan with MFP. She hopes for your cooperation to continue with her goals. She is also committed to making her payments on time as with the previous loans. She also wants to keep working with the members of the communal bank because they are all kind and supportive. With the 4000 soles she has asked for, she will buy chicks to raise.

This family is united and loving and they live in a house of their own in the indigenous community of Yavirironi, R\u00edo Negro District, Satipo Province.  An\u00edbal has been a farmer since 1999.  He recalls that when he was a little boy he\u2019d head out to the fields with his tools to help his parents with their work.\r\n\r\nHe currently has two parcels of farmland where he grows good quality coffee since residents in his location are concerned with organic coffee production.  \u201cLast year I harvested 15 sacks and this year I will harvest about 20 sacks,\u201d he mentions happily.  The work is very tiring.  An\u00edbal must face intense rain that hammers his community and the crops during these months (January, February and March).  Otherwise he\u2019d not have the satisfaction of successfully selling his products.  His spouse gives him unconditional support but when the tasks are more intense he hires extra laborers to streamline the work.  An\u00edbal has two parcels of farmland that are still fallow so one of his plans is to plant more coffee.  \r\n\r\nThis would be An\u00edbal\u2019s first loan from MFP so he says that he will be responsible with his monthly installment payments.

He will use the loan money to buy 7000 coffee seedlings to start the plantation on the two parcels.  Each seedling costs 20 c\u00e9ntimos.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1019651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 7000 coffee seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-02T16:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-02T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anibal ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-06T06:03:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399501,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth de 39 a\u00f1os, convive con su pareja hace 18 a\u00f1os.

This will be his third loan with MFP, so he hopes for your collaboration in order to continue with his goals. He promises to make his payments on time, as with previous loans, and thus have a good credit record. \r\n\r\nWith the amount requested of 2500 nuevos soles, he will purchase pipes and teflon to make repairs to his networks and expand them to two new customers who will have water. This way, he will be able to provide better service to his customers.

He started his business by himself more than 15 years ago.  He started with his own capital and little by little, he increased his customer base through effort and dedication.  He considers his business to be profitable.  He has quite a bit of demand because of the growth of the automotive sector.  He likes his job because it lets him be in the comfort of his home.  With the economic income that it makes him, he can pay for his higher education.  On the other hand, he doesn't like it when some customers are late with their payments when he grants them credit.  But this doesn't get him down, and he continues working with the same eagerness.  Now he has plans to continue with his business and to make it grow.  This will be his third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He hopes that through it, he can make his plans concrete.  He promises to make his payments on time like he has done with his previous loans.

She is a very responsible woman and for that reason, does not permit minors to enter her establishment. Maria has always upheld social norms and respected her obligations. Her business is located in her house where she prepared a space for attending to her customers. Previously, her business was located in her parents' house, but because business was growing and she wanted to have her own house, for the last 2 years she has lived and worked in her house.\r\n\r\nMaria likes her work since it allows her to enjoy some moments of relaxation in which she can take care of household matters. Besides, she has good customers who bring her good earnings. She hopes to continue working as she has, in order to keep growing and increasing her working capital. \r\n\r\nThis will be Maria's 16th loan through MFP.

She is also happy and friendly.  She is in a common-law marriage with Eduardo, who transports cargo for a living.  He is the father of their 8 children, the majority of which are now independent.  She lives with her youngest son, Javier, who is 30, in their own home.  Elva raises chickens.  She has a small shed that has a maximum capacity of 200 chickens, which is located in back of her home.  There she raises them and sells them at markets in the area, managing to sell all of her production.\r\n\r\nElva stated her business with her own capital that was the fruit of her savings more than 33 years ago.  She also has the support of Eduardo, who is in charge of cleaning and feeding the chickens.  She considers her business to be rather profitable due to the demand that this product has.  It is consumed in mass as part of the daily diet of the population.  What she likes most about her job is being able to have extra economic income for her home's expenses.  On the other hand, what she doesn't like is that sometimes part of her production dies due to plagues, and she has occasional losses.  This is why she had to start over thanks to the support of Microfinanzas Prisma.  She has plans to continue her work and to make some repairs and improvements to her shed.  This will be her twelfth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she hopes that through it she can make her plans concrete.  She will make all of her payments on time so she can have a good credit record.  She feels very good about her communal bank.  She thinks the members are sociable and supportive.  With the requested amount of 1,000 PEN, she will invest in the repair of her shed's infrastructure.

During the fishing, she constantly monitors her workers via radio and cellular phone, in the zones that have a signal.  She does this to maintain control and especially to know if her workers are in need of anything.  During her five years in this work, Hildegath has learned a lot, so much that she went from not knowing what she was doing at all to becoming an excellent administrator of her boats.  Hildegath likes what she does, she earns a good income and her work on land is only laying out the day's catch for the buyers and the city's fish traders.  She hopes to keep working the same and down the line to expand by adding another boat to her fleet.  This will be her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy knowing that she will have financial support, which will help to assure her that she will be able to advance her business.
