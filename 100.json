Del Rosario Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cVirgen del Rosario\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and, as a very mountainous area ranging 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level, has many limitations such as the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVirgen del Rosario\u201d is located at approximately 2,500 meters above sea level in the community of Huanchuy, in the district of Chincho, province of Angaraes. The small town of Huanchuy is located at the border of the Cachi River and used to be an old colonial hacienda. Although the village politically belongs to the region of Huancavelica, all business is done with Ayacucho, the biggest city nearby. Most members of the group have never even been to the capital of their region!\r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the population are related to agriculture. The valley of Huanchuy has an excellent climate because of the relatively low altituD. and the availability of water throughout the year. The climate makes it possible to grow a great variety of products like tara and black corn and many fruits and vegetables like avocado, pacay, tuna (prickly pear cactus fruit), sugarcane, carrots, and lettuce. In higher altitudes, the population also grows potatoes. From the tuna cactus comes another product: cochinilla, a small parasite (insect) that is used for its powerful coloring for cosmetics (locals used it to paint their faces or lips in traditional festivals). Besides cultivating all of the mentioned products, most people dedicate their time to raising small animals like guinea pigs, chicken, ducks and rabbits; and bigger animals as cows and bulls. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,400 soles (about 1,225 US$). The loans range from 200 up to 600 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save. But all agree to save in the future for reinvestment in their businesses or maybe to buy a community sewing machine. The expectations of the members of the new village bank incluD. receiving trainings on \u201cmarketing\u201d (how to improve their business) and learning how to weave and stitch cloths. Besides that, they think the village bank will be an excellent way to share ideas and experiences.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Nancy. Nancy will receive a loan of 600 soles and runs a small grocery store in the community. With her loan, she will increase her merchandise, buying more soft drinks, beers, sweets, fruits and other groceries. Nancy\u00b4s dream for the future is to have her own sewing business. With FINCA Peru, she wants to learn to save so that she can improve her business and help her father.\r\n<p>\r\nMaura tells another story. She sells vegetables at local weekly markets, going from one to the other. But her main market is the one in Secclla. With her 600 soles loan, she will buy more vegetables like carrots, black potato, celery and onions. Part of what she sells comes from her own small terrain, but she also buys vegetables from other members of the community. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":162975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-25T05:42:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Nemensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edy Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-09T20:11:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3400,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-07-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262045,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-08-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290971,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-09-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321363,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-10-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":353685,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":200.84,"local_amount":557.43,"processed_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314370,"comment":null},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":566.65,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":567.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-26T20:11:57Z","paid_date":"2009-01-15T20:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":49632,"name":"Komla","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr. Komla G., aged 45, did not get a lot of schooling before entering the business world.

For this reason, Mrs. Ram\u00edrez seeks a loan to purchase the following products:  3 cases of Pepsi at $12USD each, 3 cases of Coca-Cola at $11USD each, 3 cases of bottled water at $8USD each, 3 cases of canned juices at $9USD each, 60 packs of bagged water at $0.25USD each, 3 packs of Ritz crackers at $3USD each, 6 packs of Chiky cookies at $1.50USD each, 4 bags of cliclin sweets at $2USD each, 4 bags of meneitos at $5USD each, and 4 packages of chocolates at $3USD each. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa microempresaria Maria Petronila Ram\u00edrez Z. tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera con dos hijos ambos menores quienes estudian en nivel primario.

Within this group, few of the members know how to speak Spanish.  This, however, is not an impediment to them in getting ahead with their businesses given that they know the local idiom of Maya Kachikel very well.  At the onset of the interview many of the women were intimidated by my presence and became very shy, since in their village they had never had a visit from a \u201cgringo\u201d.  Over time, however, and thanks to the support of the credit agent Marta Julia, they were able to gain confidence and share with me some of their experiences. <p>\r\n\r\nThe majority of the clients are in sales.  They will invest their loan into their small stores that stock basic need or convenience products.  One of them, Maria Teresa S., will invest her loan in the sale of wood.  Thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase twice as much that which she bought before and she hopes that this will help her business to grow. <p>\r\n\r\nThe other part of the group works in textiles, weaving traditional fabrics.  Two of the four craftswomen contract other weavers for labor.  Marcela S. currently has three employees under contract to meet the demand from her customers.  Meanwhile, Lucia L., one of the older members, has six weavers under contract. <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Friendship Bridge offers all the members savings products.  The women commented that they are very grateful to the institution because they will finally be able to put their earnings in safekeeping.  They want to reinvest their entire savings into their businesses.  Another reason why they are happy with the institution is that it is one of the few that has offered financial products to their communities.  When the women were asked why they chose to work with Friendship Bridge, they said simply that it was because they hadn\u2019t heard of any other such institution in their community.   <p>\r\n\r\nThe dream of these women is to grow their businesses and, in this way, have a stable a enterprise that will help support them and their families. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Patzuntzun II vienen de una aldea remota llamada Concepci\u00f3n en el departamento de Solol\u00e1.

Otra raz\u00f3n por que las clientas est\u00e1n contentas con la instituci\u00f3n es porque es la \u00fanica o una de las muy pocas que ha llegado a ofrecer productos financieros a sus comunidades. Cuando se les pregunt\u00f3 a las se\u00f1oras porque escogieron trabajar con Friendship Bridge simplemente dijeron porque no hab\u00edan escuchado de otra instituci\u00f3n en su

The amount she is requesting in this funding round is 625USD, to invest in buying more lemon trees and fertilizer to expand the lemon tree operation.  \r\n<p><b> Translated from Vietnamese by Chi N., Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Sinh, 53 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2002. 4 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con c\u1ee7a ch\u1ecb Sinh \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh.

in 1977 in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9, Miss Adjo A. spent a few years in primary school before undertaking an apprenticeship as a seamstress because of financial difficulties. Married with no children, she nevertheless has a heavy responsibility in the care of her parents and one of her sisters. The meager income from her poorly-equipped sewing workroom is not sufficient to cover the household expenses. Yet through her dynamism and impeccable work, she has been able to manage and reimburse the previous loan without any problem.  To meet the demands of her customers, Miss A. needs to be better equipped. She is therefore requesting a loan that will help her buy more sewing machines and work materials, as she is training four apprentices.\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e en 1977 \u00e0 Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9, Mlle A.

Very early on, he started working in the milling business.  An owner of a milling machine in his town, he is married and the father of four.  In addition, he has his mother to care for.  A very energetic and honest man, he figured out how to manage his initial loan and to repay it without incident.  Once again, he is requesting a loan for setting up another mill.  Thus, he is thinking he will increase his bottom line and therefore his income.  He will then be able to help more in improving his family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 le 14 juillet 1977 \u00e0 Kpov\u00e9 dans la Pr\u00e9fecture de Haho, Monsieur T.

Pedro's minibus has the capacity to transport 12 people.  As he is a member of the union his routes are defined by them.  He takes passengers to distant communities in the region.  While he has years of experience in this field, competition is quite elevated because of the increase of public transport vehicles and unions that offer the same service. At the same time, demand has increased due to the growing migration of people from the interior. The following application is to repair his minibus, which does not have an exact price as he fix it and he will use the loan to buy parts.  Previously he has obtained loans from the institution and demonstrated that he is a responsible person who is punctual with his loans.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nPedro tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene un minibus con el que trabaja en el Sindicato 10 de febrero de su localidad.\r\nSu familia esta conformada por sus tres hijos, sus dos padres y su esposa que realiza labores de casa.

is 34 years old and has four children: Ana Mar\u00eda, 12; Julieta, 10; Sergio, 8; and young Sebastian who is 5 years old. Cristina has a business set up at home where she manufactures shoes, sandals, and boots. Once she has manufactured the footwear, it is delivered to the stores and they finish the details. There is little competition in this field as the work requires qualified and specialized labor. With the present loan Cristina will buy three machines that will allow her to become more independent and to increase her income. She will buy two straight stitch sewing machines and a serger (overlock machine). This is Cristina\u2019s third credit with this institution and she has proven to be a responsible person, punctual with her payments. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCristina tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene una familia que consta de sus cuatro hijos Ana Mar\u00eda de 12 a\u00f1os, Julieta de 10 a\u00f1os, Sergio de 8 a\u00f1os y el peque\u00f1o Sebastian de 5 a\u00f1os de edad.

De Oro I Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>The women that make up the Corazon de Oro I group are from a town called El Jaibalito located on the shores of Atitlan Lake.  El Jaibalito is a small town located on a very steep hill.  Almost all homes are located on the mountain slope.  This small town is not connected to other neighboring towns by any roads due to the mountainous terrain and the volcanoes, which make it difficult to build a road.  You can only reach the town by boat.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually when a town is isolated the local culture remains intact and this is the case with El Jaibalito.  The women mainly speak Maya-Tzutujil, and as you can see in the photo they wear their traditional garb.  The lack of exposure to other cultures inhibits the townspeople when they encounter a \u201cforeigner.\u201d  The meeting between the women and myself was very funny.  They spend the entire interview laughing and it was a very entertaining moment.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the women that belong to this group are weavers.  They are going to invest their loan in the purchase of raw materials and different colored threads.  With this thread they are gong to make beautiful traditional costumes using ancient waist loom techniques.  The women in the region of Atitlan are taught how to weaved by their mothers at the age of nine years old. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The women believe the loan is useful because it will help them buy a large quantity of thread and with this they will be able to make more huipiles (embroidered blouses), whether their clients pay them on time or not.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group of women is always smiling and they deserve an opportunity to succeed as entrepreneurs.  Through this loan they can get this opportunity.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Sandy Ju\u00e1rez, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras que conforman el grupo Coraz\u00f3n de Oro I vienen de un pueblo llamado \u201cel Jaibalito\u201d ubicado a las orillas del Lago Atitl\u00e1n. El Jaibalito es un pueblo muy peque\u00f1o que est\u00e1 ubicado en una cuesta muy, pero muy, empinada. Casi todas las casas est\u00e1n ubicadas en las laderas de una monta\u00f1a. Este peque\u00f1o pueblo no est\u00e1 conectado por carreteras con los otros pueblos vecinos ya que la complicada geograf\u00eda de las monta\u00f1as y volcanes no permite que una carretera sea construida. Solo se puede llegar al pueblo por medio de lanchas.\r\n\r\n<P>Usualmente cuando un pueblo esta aislado, la cultura del lugar permanece intacta, y el Jaibalito no es la excepci\u00f3n. Las mujeres hablan mayormente el Maya-Tzutujil y, como se ve en la foto, ellas visten sus bellos trajes tradicionales. La falta de exposici\u00f3n a otras culturas inhibe a la gente cuando ellas ven a un \u201cextranjero\u201d. El encuentro entre las se\u00f1oras y mi persona fue muy gracioso. Las mujeres se pasaron toda la entrevista ri\u00e9ndose. Ese momento fue muy ameno.  \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras que pertenecen a este grupo son tejedoras. Ellas van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de materia prima, hilos de distintos colores. Con estos hilos, ellas van a elaborar bellos trajes tradicionales utilizando la t\u00e9cnica antigua de telar de cintura. Las mujeres en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n aprenden, de sus madres, a tejer desde que tienen nueve a\u00f1os de edad.\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres piensan que el cr\u00e9dito si les sirve porque les ayuda a comprar mayor cantidad de hilo y con este poder elaborar m\u00e1s huipiles, independientemente si sus clientes le pagan o no a tiempo. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras que cargan una bella sonrisa todos lados merecen una oportunidad de salir adelante como empresarias. Por medio de este cr\u00e9dito esta oportunidad se les puede brindar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":163416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

This is Ruth\u2019s third loan with the institution and the time of their business relationship demonstrates that she is a responsible person who is punctual with her payments.  \r\n<p><b>Translated

Two of her children already got married.  She lives with her husband and three other children.  Their main jobs are farming and breeding animals.  The types of animals she breeds are also varied: chickens, ducks, pigs, geese, and buffaloes, depending on each season, the condition of the economy, and the local weather.  Since investing in the farm brings good profit, each year Ms. L. is able to borrow more money from TYM Fund.  On average, her income from breeding animals is about 2000 USD per year.  Her three children are working and helping her whenever she finds difficulty with the repayments.  This coming loan cycle, Ms. L. applies for a loan of 625USD to buy more ducks, chickens, and their food.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Cao Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean, 51 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1997. 2 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ri\u00eang, ch\u1ecb Li\u00ean s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 3 con.

Her children attend higher education so the expenses are high.

Her life slowly becomes easier with time, 3 of her children have graduated from university and they all have a steady job. Today, Mrs C\u1ed9ng is still getting loans from TYM to get her youngest child through university. Lately people start farming a lot so her business has picked up.

the shores of Atitlan Lake.  This town is far from other villages.  Access roads are limited and you can only get there by boat since the uneven terrain does not allow for the construction of a road.  <\/p>\r\n<p>The people of El Jaibalito are traditional, and as you can see in the photo all the women wear the native traditional garb.  Except for one woman who speaks Spanish, the rest of the women only speak Maya Tzutujil.  This language is only spoken on the shores of Atitlan Lake and part of the Guatemalan coast. <\/p>\r\n<p>All the women in this group are weavers. They will use their loan to purchase thread, which they will weave into elaborate traditional textiles on a traditional waist loom.   You can also find women that participate in this communal bank that invest their loan in raising game and many of them also work in construction.  Women work as part of the work force involved in the construction of buildings in Jaibalito. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The women believe that the loan they are getting will help them expand their business.  The lack of funds doesn\u2019t allow them to buy the raw materials necessary to make the products that are asked of them.  This problem could easily be solved with the loan that they will be given. <\/p>\r\n<p>Members of Corazon de Oro II like working together because they know each other and where their partners live and they trust each other.  The size of the loan is small.  Many women are asking for similar loans and this similarity helps group consolidation because they are all at the same level. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These women deserve the opportunity to secure this loan and expand their business.

Cotay\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations as it is a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level). These limitations incluD. the cold, the difficulty of growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVilL. Cotay\u201d is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea level in the community of Cotay, in the district of Anco, province of Churcampa. The small town of Cotay is located where there once used to be an old colonial hacienda, and the people lived there to work on the hacienda. Most business is done with the city of Huancayo, the biggest city nearby and a 4-5 hour drive away. The main activities of the population are related to agriculture and incluD. growing crops like barley, wheat, corn, potato, oca, peas and beans. Most of the population also raises sheep, cattle and small animals.\r\n<p>\r\nThe bank is starting its first loan-cycle with 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 2,400 soles (about 875 US$). The loans range from 100, 200, 300, and up to 500 soles. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group already is in its third loan-cycle in over one year of existence. In their time with FINCA Peru, the members have worked very hard to save and to be more responsible with money and in their businesses. They want to improve the quality of their lives; they are especially motivated because they want their children to have a good education, to be professionals, and to have better opportunities. When talking about the future, these items are the most important ones.\r\n<p>\r\nIn FINCA Per\u00fa, what the members have learned and want to continue learning is how to know and understand each other better, how to share responsibilities amongst the members, how to be better entrepreneurs, how to calculate the gains of selling their products, and how to do family planning. When asked about their savings, most are equally-minded. Savings are for improving their businesses and for their children's education or their housing when studying. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Doris. Doris will receive a loan of 200 soles and has a small business of buying and selling small animals. Besides that, she also sells cereals and clothes. Her business depends a lot on the time of year.  Doris works to support her family, especially the education of her children. Before she did not do a lot. She was not working and depended completely on her husband. Now she runs her own little small business! She is creating her own opportunities and savings as well. Now her husband is jealous sometimes because her business is going well and she is the one earning the money for the household. Her dream is for her children to leave the community, to study to become engineers and that way give something back to the community in future, applying what they studied. (She is very sure her children will help). She has the dream of going to a place where she can run a bigger business. With her savings, she wants to improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\nViviana P. D. L. C. tells another story. She started her business making clothes for children. Together with her husband, they operate some machines for making the clothes and sell them at nearby weekly markets. Another business she runs is buying and selling cereals in Huancayo. When in Huancayo she uses her time to buy more materials for her clothing business. With her 500 soles loan, she will buy more materials in Huancayo. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business and in the education of her children. Besides that she is thinking about buying terrain in Huancayo in the future and a car to be able to move her product. Now that she is in FINCA Per\u00fa, she has learned to care for and value herself as she learned to save.\r\n <p>\r\nCipriana L. Montan\u00e9z has a small grocery store and sells shoes and clothes in the time the kids go back to school. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more supplies for her store. Her dream for the future is to improve her small store and for her grandchildren to study. (Unfortunately her children did not have the opportunity to study). As well the family is thinking about buying a house in Huancayo where the grandchildren can live when they are studying. In FINCA Per\u00fa, she has learned that women can work as well and that they, too, can change something in their lives to improve the quality. Besides that, she has learned to value herself. She wishes her late husband could be alive to see that she is ok!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":163539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy more

Anco\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level). These limitations incluD. the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cLas Rosas D. Anco\u201d, is located at approximately 2,300 meters above sea level in the community of Anco, in the district with the same name, province of Churcampa. Anco is located at the border of the Mantaro river and is one of the lowest places in the department of Huancavelica. Due to its relatively low altituD., the area has a warm, almost tropical climate. The warm climate and the vicinity of the river make the area very suitable for growing fruits like oranges, lemons, avocado, papaya and mango. Besides the fruits, most of the people dedicate their time raising guinea-pigs and chicken. They also produce alfalfa, the crop that makes the diet of the guinea-pigs. The town of Anco is situated on the main road between 2 prominent Andes cities: Ayacucho and Huancayo. Business is done with both cities, and also people stopping on the road use the variety of services in town.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 10 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,800 soles (about 1,750 US$). The loans range from 200, 300, 400, 500 and up to 600 soles. \r\nBecause the bank has been formed recently, it has no history yet. The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating now is for investing in their businesses or for the education of their children, whether to buy school uniforms, supplies, books, or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Flor D. Mar\u00eda Q. A.. Flor will receive a loan of 600 soles and has a small business selling food in a kiosk on the main road. Besides that she also raises guinea-pigs. She almost has 200, and business is going well. Her dream for the future is to have her own restaurant, to have a guinea-pig farm with more than 1,000 small animals, and for her children to study. With her savings, she hopes to open her restaurant and maybe go to a bigger place with her husband, somewhere where there is a university where their children can study, where it will be more easy to have a better business.  In FINCA Peru, she wants to learn and save more and learn to valuate herself as a person. \r\n<p>\r\nDoris Sara M. P. tells another story. She runs a small grocery store and has an internet cabin. Besides that, she serves meals to the employees of the district government.  In the future, she wants to improve her grocery store and send her children to study at the university, so they can be professionals. She would like to improve the number of computers. With her 300 soles loan, she will increase her groceries. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business, increasing her internet business, install a fax machine, and open her restaurant.  Now that she is in FINCA Per\u00fa, she hopes to to care for and value herself. Most women do not value themselves a lot. Fortunately now there is FINCA Per\u00fa which works only with women. She expects to receive trainings on how to improve business and how to work equally with men. (Her husband will do the cooking while she will attend the bank reunion and afterwards she will explain to him what she has learned!).\r\n<p>\r\nTabita Durcal C. A. has a small business selling an elixir of 7 seeds and is running a small grocery store. Besides that she buys and sells cereals and school supplies for the children. With her 400 soles loan, she will buy more supplies for her store. Tabita has many dreams, like improving the lives of her children. When her husband left her, she thought that she would never improve her life and get out of her misery.

To help family income, Satemi opens a foodstall in their house. Satemi also has steady customers, since in the area a plenty of brick making businesses. During rest hours, Satemi's food stall is visited by many customers. To increase business, Satemi hopes to get the Rp 1,000,000 (about US$125) loan. That loan would be used to buy glass rack from stainless steel for Rp500,000 (about $63), so that it would be more hygienic and looks more attractive, since today she is still using wooden rack.

Satemi bersama suaminya sudah tinggal di Bali selama 5 tahun. Hal itu dilakukannya karena ia ingin meningkatkan kesejahteraan keluarganya. Di Jawa penduduknya sangat padat dan sangat sulit untuk membuka usaha. Sekarang mereka tinggal disebuah rumah sederhana dengan lahan sewaan bersama 2 orang anaknya. Suaminya bekerja sebagai seorang pencari kayu bakar untuk dijual kembali. Dia sudah mempunyai langganan tetap sehingga pemasarannya tidak perlu dikhawatirkan. Untuk menunjang usaha keluarga, Satemi membuka usaha warung dirumahnya. Satemi juga mempunyai pelanggan tetap, karena disekitar lingkungan tempat tinggalnya banyak terdapat usaha pembuatan batu bata. Sehingga saat jam \u2013 jam istirahat siang, warung Satemi banyak dikunjungi pelanggan. Untuk meningkatkan pendapatan warungnya, Satemi mengharapkan untuk mendapat pinjaman sebesar Rp. 1.000.000.- Pinjaman itu akan digunakannya untuk membeli sebuah rak kaca dari bahan stainless seharga Rp. 500.000.- sehingga kelihatan lebih menarik dan hygienis, karena yang sekarang masih dari rak kayu. Sisa dari pinjaman itu akan digunakannya untuk menambah kelengkapan warungnya. Saat ini Satemi bisa memperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp. 25.000.- per hari dan Satemi berharap dengan adanya perubahan dan penambahan kelengkapan di warungnya, ia bisa meningkatkan keuntungan yang didapatnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":163976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy glass rack and add sales items (Membeli rak kaca dan menambah barang dagangan)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-26T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Satemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-09T05:19:32Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-06-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249978,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278568,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308066,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339204,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":234612.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-26T05:19:32Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50118,"name":"Jamshed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamshed G. is 33 years old.
