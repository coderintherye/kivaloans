Her husband helps her, staying to care for their still quite young children, helping with the business, and doing the household chores.\r\n\r\nWith this job, she has been able to buy some land, where she has been able to build, little by little, the house in which her family currently lives, and she has been able to, above all, pay for her eldest daughter's university tuition.  Her greatest wish is to buy a stand in the market where she works so she can stop paying rent and buy a taxi she can rent, which would provide additional income.

She started her business with her own savings that her husband gave her.  He works for a telecommunications company, and together they have been able to obtain their own home despite the many dificulties they face.  She has two children, both of whom study, and they hope to be able to provide the necessary support to watch their sons grow up to be good men.  Her goal is to make home improvements, since it is not all currently made of concrete.  This makes their home less safe because in their neighborhood, Ayapal, violence is increasing because of unemployment and economic instability due to the harvest drought.  This instability has arisen from the increasing prices of the basic household groceries.  In addition, they have a dirt floor, which they would like to replace with tile, because it is more hygienic.  With her last loan, Josefa bought a glass counter to better display her products, and with this loan, she will buy clothing and sandals, which are the products in highest demand.  She offers bi-weekly credit for payment, but unfortunately her clients do not always pay on the agreed date, so she has to front her own funds to buy more clothes.  She hopes that this loan will help her make a good profit so she can continue buying construction materials for her humble home.  She is thankful to AFODENIC for its support and the opportunity for this access to finance.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":420212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"The purchase of clothing and sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-04T18:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa Nuvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601735,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003180,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841336,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874251,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604149,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639614,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821388,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561404,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-23T00:39:46Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149791,"name":"Tamemsu Ii Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa M., Fatmata K.

The purpose of her current loan is to buy palm oil for bolstering her inventory. She is a merchant with highly diversified businesses. She has rented three twin stalls at the Guediawaye marketplace where she operates.\r\n\r\nBesides the palm oil that she markets, she also sells cloth and maintenance products, for example, detergents. She capitalizes on four years of experience in the field of poultry farming.\r\n\r\nShe supports the family because she is married and the mother of ten children, who vary in age from 9 to 31 years. Plus, she has another person in her care. For these reasons, she is more motivated during this period ahead of the holidays, such as Tabaski, Korite, or New Year's Day, when business is the most profitable.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to bolster her

Mabinuligon, Barangay Sampinit, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is 62 years old but still strong and healthy enough to earn a living. She is married to Nolito A., who is a farmer. The couple is blessed with eleven children, ten of whom already have their own a families but also help support their parents. Only one child remains single. Nenita and Nolito have ten grandchildren.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, Nenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could put up her own business and help her husband support their very large family. Because her husband was a farmer and there were many rice farms in their area, Nenita decided to put up a rice retailing business with the help of her loans from NWTF-PD. She bought newly-harvested unmilled rice from the farmers at a much lower cost and made money by having the rice milled and retailing the polished rice within her community and in the neighboring villages.\r\n\r\nThe income from Nenita\u2019s business was able to help her family a lot, enabling them to pay for tuition fees and other household expenses. Earning an average monthly income of PHP 5,000, the business helped improve the family's living conditions, and it became a crucial source of income when her husband got sick two years ago. It is now a major source of income for her family, but Nenita plans to restock and reopen her general store to supplement her present income.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan Nenita borrowed Php 18,000 for her rice retailing business. The loan was, as usual, fully repaid on time without any delays. Now, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing Php 18,000 for her business and to reopen her general store. She intends to use the income to pay for her husband's medicines and support her household expenses.\r\n\r\nNenita is considered as one of the pioneers of NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bago Branch. She is a very active member and consistently maintains her record as a good repayer. Nenita is shown in the accompanying photo posing with sacks of rice from her rice retailing business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams, earning the respect of people in their community. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - to be called Honorable is a mark of respect that everyone hopes to attain in one\u2019s lifetime.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":419887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To invest in

Buenavista, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is 51 years old and married to Francisco P., a farmer. They are blessed with three children, one of whom has a family already while the other two are still attending school. One of Nieva's dreams is for her two children to finish their education so that they are able to earn a good income and help her in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nWhile her children were growing up, Nieva realized that she could not rely totally on the income her husband earned from farming. This is because it could sometimes be very volatile and dependent on so many external factors, including the weather, that may affect the volume of production. Added to this was also the increasing expense of educating her children. This is why Nieva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could access capital to start a general store. Using her loans over the next few years, Nieva continued to expand her operations, and began to include frozen products. She now earns an average monthly income of 12,000 PHP \u2013 a very respectable income that has been a great help in improving her family's quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her last loan, Nieva borrowed 11,000 PHP, which she used as additional capital for her general store and frozen products. She paid off that loan on time each week until it was fully paid. This time, she is borrowing another 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use to restock her general store and purchase more products to sell. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" \u2013 to be called \"Honorable\" is a mark of respect that everyone hopes to attain in their

Carlos has been working as a welder for 10 years, a business he started with his own funds. He is a widow and has seven adult children who support him. The difficult part of this business is that sometimes there is no work and money becomes scarce, making it difficult to carry out plans. Due to the economic crisis that is happening in our country, that is hurting the economy, the prices of basic groceries have increased and sometimes it is even difficult to put bread on the table. With this loan Carlos would buy construction materials to build a side wall on his house because there is a lot of crime in the neighborhood and it is necessary to take precautions. Sometimes one can sacrifice a lot to earn their possessions and then out of nowhere they are stolen. For this reason it is necessary to close off the side of the house.

In addition, he spends a few hours transporting passengers in his motorcycle taxi, which he has been doing for 13 years.   \r\n<p>\r\nFederico enjoys the fact that his store has provided income to cover some of their household expenses.  However, he says providing good service to his customers is what is important.  The competitive environment is favorable because he is the only one in his area with this type of business.  In the future, he hopes to build a mini-market where his neighbors can come to make their daily purchases.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Federico\u2019s tenth loan with MFP.  He enjoys working with his Communal Bank because all the members are close and supportive of one another.  The money he requested will be used to buy more consumer staples so that he can continue to manage his business properly. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":420319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Increase his inventory of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T04:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Federico","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":174.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":183.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":192.64},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":195.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":207.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":212.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.49},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":166.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":169.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843150,"comment":null},{"amount":117.06,"local_amount":334.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":340.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734728,"comment":null},{"amount":2.71,"local_amount":7.73,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124090,"comment":null},{"amount":64.1,"local_amount":183.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959793,"comment":null},{"amount":67.42,"local_amount":192.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":196.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992639,"comment":null},{"amount":68.48,"local_amount":195.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":199.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717423,"comment":null},{"amount":72.49,"local_amount":207.12,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":210.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751180,"comment":null},{"amount":74.35,"local_amount":212.42,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":216.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933735,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T04:51:45Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149825,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana (37 a\u00f1os) es madre soltera, tiene 2 hijos; uno estudia en el colegio y el otro es un peque\u00f1o de 2 a\u00f1itos.\n\nElla es muy buena en la elaboraci\u00f3n de zapatos para damas, los mismos que adorna con bijouteria (piedras, perlas, cintas, y otros).

He started with his own funds from his work as a bricklayer.  They cook soups in big kettles and solid food, which they sell to the people working on construction projects.  They give their customers credit until payday because it is stable income.  They have two children, eight and twelve.  The children are in elementary school.  \r\n\r\nTheir wish is to be able to give their children a good education.  They did not finish their education because of their parents\u2019 lack of economic resources.  He lives in the Sierrita de Santo Domingo neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he will buy a large pan to prepare the food.  They will also buy basic grains, meats, vegetables, and fruits to make the refreshments.  In the future, he wants to set up a covered patio where they can cook.  Now they cook on a burner on the patio, and this is difficult on winter days.  Also, they would like to be able to get new customers and to sell more to improve their income.  One of the problems they have is that sometimes their customers do not pay them because their customers have not received their pay.  This is due to the lack of funds in the economic crisis that is occurring in the country.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to Afodenic for the loan he was given.

Two times a week she prepares the chicha, and she sells it to the inhabitants in the area.

Her daily time is split between knitting girdles, preparing and selling chicha, and caring for her special son who is 15 years old.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa a credit of 1,000 nuevos soles, which she plans to use in the purchase of necessary items for making chicha de jora (corn, sugar, firewood), as well as thread for making girdles.\r\n\r\nSixta is a responsible mother and devoted to her family.

is Erlinda M., 44, with her five children and her husband Mercelito, an auto mechanic.  They live in Malaria, Caloocan City.  The couple opened their auto repair shop two years ago along the national highway in Bankers, Tala, Caloocan City.  Over time, their shop has gained prominence thanks to their satisfied customers sharing their good experiences with other motorists.  They now make at least P12,000.00 net income a month.<p>\r\n\r\nDolores joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative last year to have access to loans to infuse more capital into their business.  She recently applied for a P8,000.00 loan to improve their business.

Aside from that, he also cultivates the small farm at the back of their house to have additional income. His desire to acquire more income motivated him to borrow a loan in the amount of 6,000 PHP from some lenders for additional working capital in his business.

C., 59 years old, and her husband Nolasco, also 59, have been farming for forty years now. Nolasco also drives for a living. They have six children. They live together in the breezy town of Silang, Cavite.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they are in season, Esmeralda trades bananas, pineapples, and other crops from their farm in the nearby market. But while waiting for the harvest to come in, she gets to attend to her general store (as shown in the picture). She is earning close to 26,000 PHP a month. She uses her profits and other savings to send her children to school; they still have two college students. Esmeralda is proud enough to declare that four of their six children finished college out of their earnings. She was also able to purchase a jeepney, which they are now using to deliver fruits and other crops to the market. \r\n<p>\r\nEsmeralda joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005.  She loves the camaraderie of the women entrepreneurs. She is applying for a new loan in the amount of 24,000 PHP, which she will use to fund the next pineapple crop. She will purchase fertilizers, pesticides, and other farm tools. Some of the funds will be used to purchase grocery items to sell at her store.\r\n<p>\r\nEsmeralda wishes to get rich so she can help her poor neighbors and relatives. Her usual prayers include good health and harmonious relationships amongst her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About CCT:<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missions in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n<p>\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

G., 31 years old, has two primary businesses: a cell phone kiosk and transportation for hire with his pick-up truck. He operates out of a market setting in Kangemi town, and his kiosk offers \"top-off' cards for cell phones, M-Pesa payment capabilities as well as other cell phone accessories. In addition to his two businesses, John has a garden where he grows cash crops of maize, beans and potatoes. His business challenges are security for the kiosk and a lack of funds for expansion.

M. is 31 years old and is married with three children aged 1, 4 and 7. Jaqueline and her family live in Rwaza district in the Northern Province of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nJaqueline has a small shop selling a wide variety of products, such as: rice, sugar, biscuits, water, cooking oil, juice, cosmetics products, candy and bread, to name a few. Since she has been in business since 2006, this is her third year of successful operation. The hours of her shop are from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.\r\n\r\nJaqueline is requesting her fourth loan from Vision Finance Company and Kiva lenders in order to expand her business through purchasing some other attractive products.

Also, the shop inventory purchasing requires credit and capital which these loans have provided her.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Jaqueline has paid back all previous loans on time and in full. The loans are allowing her to grow her business slowly and put aside money so that she will be able to pay school fees for her children as they grow older.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":420059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"BURERA\/RUHENGELI","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T18:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782210,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169307,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008309,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037528,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760201,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022632,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781717,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709599,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T06:16:05Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149908,"name":"Mary Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Rose is 40 years old and is married to Jessie.

B. is from the town of Calaran, Calamba, Misamis Occidental. She is 51 years old. Perla is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Perla sells food and other delicacies in the local community. Perla has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Perla joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase items for resale. Perla is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional items to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Perla from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

They live in polygamous families in the neighborhood of Djaka (Kirango) in Markala, fourth administrative region of Mali. The group members know each other through links of family, marriage, friendship and neighborhood. They make a living from buying, processing and selling fish. Eager to better serve its customers, the Dembagnouman Group has decided to join the credit program offered by SoroYiriwaso. This is the Group's fifth solidarity loan, after having repaid the previous four loans on schedule.\r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy 72 baskets of fresh fish and 100 ice bars, provided by carriers coming from Bamako. They get their fish supply on the banks of River Niger, then they dry part of it on gravel, on straw or on \"seccos\". The fresh fish will be sold on location in Kirango and in Diamarabougou Markala, or kept refrigerated in ice and sold at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and in Bamako. The dried fish will partly be stockpiled until the water level of the river drops in winter and they can sell it at a higher price, and partly be sold in Dougabougou, Siribala, N., Shango and Boussin, as well as at the weekly market in S\u00e9gou. They also sell smoked fish, mainly in S\u00e9gou. Most of their sales are for cash to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n<p>\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 75,500 CFA francs which they will spend on small household expenses and use to take part in social events (baptisms, weddings and funerals). Their ambition is to buy livestock so as to build houses for their children in future, because their father's house belongs to them all and nobody has the ownership of it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":420633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T15:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeratou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bafanta                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baminata                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nana            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaya                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bamass\u00e9                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan        Foun\u00e9              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":875000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":285.71,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873790,"comment":null},{"amount":285.72,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763520,"comment":null},{"amount":285.71,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152335,"comment":null},{"amount":285.72,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991189,"comment":null},{"amount":285.71,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021456,"comment":null},{"amount":285.72,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746256,"comment":null},{"amount":285.71,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":126346.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778828,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T02:31:08Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":149959,"name":"Djiguifa Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Djiguifa est un regroupement de femmes toutes mari\u00e9es, vivant majoritairement dans des grandes familles traditionnelles.

The Nyetaa Group is on its fifth group loan, having paid back the four previous loans with no problems.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will allow them to purchase 40 baskets of fresh fish and 12 blocks of ice. They stock up on fresh fish locally, on the banks of the Niger River. A good portion of this fish is dried, either on stones, straw or \"seccos\". The rest is sold in different ways: the fresh fish is sold locally in Kirango and Diamarabougou Markala; the fresh fish conserved on ice is sold in S\u00e9gou (at the castle market) and Bamako; the dried fish, some of which is kept until the waters recede when it is worth more, is mostly sold in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin and at the weekly fair in S\u00e9gou; the smoked fish is mainly sold in S\u00e9gou.

On average they are 31 years old with 4 children and live in the Djaka (Kirango) neighborhood of Markala (4th administrative Region of the republic of Mali).  This group is united by bonds of kinship, marriage, friendship, and neighborhood.  They are members of the traditional \"Traor\u00e9 Ton\" association that gave its name to their current association.  Their activity is the sale of fish in various forms.  Sabougnouman is a group that collaborates with Soro Yiriwaso and that is on its 5th loan, after having repaid the preceding ones well.  This new loan will be used to buy 10 baskets of fresh fish and 50 blocks of ice (furnished by the carriers coming from Bamako).  They supply themselves with fresh fish on the spot by the river Niger.  A good part of this fish is dried on gravel, on straw or on one of the \"dryers\". The fish is sold in various ways: the fresh fish are sometimes sold on the spot by the river, in Kirango and in Diamarabougou Markala in the market or on foot in the neighborhoods.  The fresh fish is packed in ice and sold in S\u00e9gou (in the market house).  Part of the dried fish is preserved until winter, when they earn more money and is sold in the markets of Dougabougou, Siribala, Boussin and S\u00e9gou. They generally sell the fish themselves to a cash clientele composed of women and men.  They hope to realize a monthly average profit of 37,000 FCFA that will serve to satisfy their small family needs.

She says that she visits her customers in their homes.  They are her neighbors, but she also has customers in other communities.  She started this business when her cousin visited her.  Her cousin offered to let her help selling quilts that she could bring from Oaxaca.  C. Maria wants this loan to increase her business in order to get the income to buy her children the necessities like books, uniforms, milk, diapers, and medicine.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Milagros, is part of the Las Sirenas Group.  She is 23.  She helps with her mother\u2019s business, which is cooking from home.  She needs the loan to buy corn, flour, chilies, tomatoes, cheese, and cream.  The customers come to the house at all hours of the day to buy her food.  She sells things like tortillas, \u201cgorditas\u201d (a small thick tortilL. maD. from corn flour, split open and usually filled with chicken or meat, accompanied by salsa), and empanadas.  They want this loan to increase their business in order to get earnings to some day create another business like a grocery store.\r\n\r\nJaquelin M. V. rents out tables and chair for events like weddings, \u201cquincea\u00f1os\u201d (celebration of the 15th birthday), and baptisms for babies.  There can be 200 people at each event.  She is asking for a loan to buy more chairs and tables because sometimes customers ask for her services on the same day.  This way she could serve them better.\r\n\r\nThe other members are:\r\n\r\nConsuelo V. V.:  Sells shoes\r\nYoshelin G\u00f3mez A.:  Makes handicrafts\r\nConsuelo L. D. L.

It is comprised of nine members, seven women and two men who work in commerce.  \n\nRaquel C. R., Roberta T. P., and Jose Luis P. C. sell clothes.  Porfirio R. G. and Angel P. F. sell cosmetics and perfumes by catalog.  Araceli P. C. sells shoes by catalog.  Pared Uriel C. G. sells silver in towns bordering his community.  Reyna C. V. makes outfits, blouses, pants, and handicrafts.  Antonia G. M. sells fruit and vegetables, and she will tell us a little about it.\n\nAntonia G. M. is 59 and married.  Her husband works as a taxi driver.  They have a common law marriage.  They have seven children, but none of them live with them.  Their children are all married, and now they are raising their 16 year old grandson.  Their daughter left him when he was one.  Antonia has raised him since then.  She has been part of the Capilla Development Cooperative since it started.  The group has worked with us for six cycles.  She tells us that the group was started by a loan representative who was with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She had some contacts from Anenecuilco, and she went to visit them.  One of the people she visited was Raquel, who was interested in the project.  She decided to look for other people like Antonia, the Godmother to one of her children.  She invited her and other people, and that is how they started.\n\nThe first loan that Antonia asked for was for $4,000, which she invested in her fruit and vegetable sales.  Then she stopped selling fruits and vegetables and started selling snacks and \u201cdobladas\u201d (folded over tortilla).  That did not go very well for her, and she decided to return to selling fruits and vegetables.  Her current loan is for $3,000.  She did not want more until the crisis we are in improves.  She will use the loan to buy tomatoes, onions, chilies, avocadoes, green beans, apples, bananas, oranges, and vegetable pears to stock her small, great business.  She has a small stand in her house, which is located on the 3 de Mayo street, number 45 in the Capilla Colony in Anenecuilco Morales.  That is where she has her vegetable sales, but she also goes to all of the colonies in Anenecuilco to be able to finish selling her merchandise.\n\nShe tells us that she has experienced many problems like her house being robbed twice while she was out selling.  They took money and appliances, etc.  Even though the neighbors see, they do not say anything.  They keep quiet because, being a town on a hill, they are afraid that the robbers will do something to them afterwards.  At times her husband has not had work either.  They have to find a way to get ahead.  She says that her biggest wish now is that her grandson finish his studies to show his mother that leaving him with his grandmother was worth it.  Antonia says she can do it with the loans, and with her husband\u2019s support.  She will continue until she achieves everything she wants to achieve.\n\nIn the future she hopes to be able to enlarge her business and also sell a few groceries.  They are hardly any of these businesses in her community.\n\nLastly, she thanks the company for giving loans to people who truly need them.  More than anything, they offer the confidence of knowing that they will be paid.  She is grateful to Kiva for associating with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  It is a very serious, and above all, honorable company.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives in a rented house that has unreliable access to running water (not potable) and electricity. \r\n\r\nThis will be Hilcia's first loan with Esperanza.  She plans to use it to start a retail business selling clothing.  She will purchase pants, blouses and skirts to sell out of her home to the others in her community. \r\n\r\nHilcia wants to use the profits from her business to help improve the living conditions for her family.  She will be able to buy clothes, shoes, and books for her children so they can attend school.  She hopes to be able to save enough money to purchase a computer and someday to purchase her own house. She thanks you for your support!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":420720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Sadly, Reylda lost her mother when she was young. When her mother died, her father abandoned their family, and Reylda and her siblings were forced to work in order to move forward.

Her husband works as a delivery driver in order to help with the household expenses.  The couple has one dependent child.  Jacquelin\u2019s plan for her family includes providing a good education for her child as well as a decent home.  She has been working as a domestic employee for a year.  She easily tires from having to cook, clean, and iron for different people, but she does whatever it takes so that she can have a larger home in the future.  Jacquelin previously worked as a cashier and dispatcher at a grocery store before her employer went bankrupt because of low sales.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not being able to purchase all of her construction materials at once because she does not make enough money and her husband\u2019s salary is used to cover their daily household necessities.  Jacquelin thanks AFODENIC for approving her second loan.  She will use the funds to purchase materials such as stone and cement.  Her first loan was used to buy enough materials to finish a room, but she would like to complete the construction of the entire house so that she can provide better security for her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":420767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T22:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaquelin Sugey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":890.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":920.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601742,"comment":null},{"amount":40.52,"local_amount":810.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":838.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003187,"comment":null},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":699.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":723.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841343,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874258,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604156,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639620,"comment":null},{"amount":56.4,"local_amount":1128.03,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1166.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821393,"comment":null},{"amount":23.6,"local_amount":471.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":488.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561409,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770371,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204278,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T12:18:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150018,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 28 years old and runs a business hawking tea leaves (going door-to-door).

Although divorced and childless, he strives to provide a better quality of life for his parents.  He lives with them and a cousin in a large house located in a populous district of Lima.  This hard-working man has sold clothing from his home for the past 15 years and has done quite well.  He buys clothing at wholesale and then sells to his customers who pay him at the end of the month.  This activity has allowed him to suffer no deprivations and has allowed him to buy the necessary appliances to furnish his home with a measure of comfort for his elderly parents.  Because C\u00e1stulo is an enterprising fellow, he also sells beer from his home, especially on week-ends when this beverage is more popular among his neighbors and friends.  Such is this man's life who learned very young to be a businessman and has learned to grow honestly thanks to his efforts and lots of work.  Nothing dissuades him from reaching his goals in life; he wants to become a great merchant and have his own clothing line as well as a well-stocked liquor store.

She is a very dedicated woman in everything she does, including her business which is being a beauty consultant.  Three year ago she began selling cosmetics from a well-known international brand.  Not only does this produce profits from her sales but the company also offers her growth opportunities to become a big businesswoman letting her incorporate various beauty consultants who want to work for the company.  They train her for this, depending on time at work, and she likes this because she knows that other companies do not offer these opportunities to their beauty consultants.  She wants to grow economically as well as to grow personallly because she is a hard-working woman having learned this from a very early age and passing it on to her children as well.  Vitalina has a second job:  she is a pediatric nurse and works mornings at a children's shelter.  This peaceful activity also generates good income for her.  For the future, she would like to become a great businesswoman with this line of cosmetics because, as she herself states:  \"I want a career with this company that gives me the opportunity to do so despite my age.\"\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP and she will be very responsible with her repayments, as usual.

They have a son who is a middle school student.  His future plans for his family is to help his son with his studies so that he can go to university and become an upstanding citizen.  For the past 4 years, Oscar has been employed as a driver by ULTRANIC.  His greatest obstacle is that he lacks the necessary funds to build his house once and for all.  He is grateful to Afodenic for approving his loan with which he hopes to reach his goal of finally having a more comfortable dwelling for his family since their present house is very small.

She currently lives alone with them, since her husband Roberto is working in another city in the field of agriculture.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, due to the circumstances of her life, Martha began selling charcoal in a market near her home. At first, the work was intermittent; she substituted for a woman who would leave the shop in her care. Over time, it became her permanent job, allowing her to help her husband with the household costs and other personal expenses. \r\n\r\nMartha enjoys running her shop, because she has no competition and it is profitable. In her own words, \"if she hadn't left it, I still would have continued, because it brought me plenty of income.\" \r\n\r\nMartha is able to run her business at the market and return home in the evening to see her daughters. She does not get tired, because she is an extremely hardworking woman with a strong desire to get ahead. She hopes someday to expand her business and sell charcoal wholesale in a large facility; thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit, she can already picture this in her mind. \r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fourth loan with MFP, and she is completely confident that she will repay it punctually, because she knows that she will have other loans in the future that will permit her to enhance her business. With the funds she is requesting, she will improve the infrastructure of the shop she currently operates, since it has deteriorated somewhat. She will begin by repairing the floor, so that her charcoal shop will project a better image to customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":420788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Renovating her charcoal shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T13:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":211.24},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":223.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":231.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":242.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":258.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":265.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":278.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":288.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":211.24,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":214.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843158,"comment":null},{"amount":152.27,"local_amount":435.05,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":441.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734739,"comment":null},{"amount":7.09,"local_amount":20.24,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124098,"comment":null},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":242.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":245.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959804,"comment":null},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":258.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992649,"comment":null},{"amount":92.94,"local_amount":265.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":269.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717434,"comment":null},{"amount":97.57,"local_amount":278.77,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":282.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751186,"comment":null},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":288.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":292.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933741,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-07T19:48:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150029,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alejandrina, a client of Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa, is part of a communal bank called Virgen Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n - Anta, consisting of 19 members.

Despite these difficulties, Carolina runs a successful business selling clothing to her friends and neighbors.

With this loan she plans on buying two dozen blouses, six dozen pairs of pants, and also a new case of perfumes. \r\n\r\nThis is Carolina\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International. She appreciates the opportunity of financing that her business now receives. Carolina\u2019s dream is to have a business big enough that she will need to hire two or three employees.

These two businesses are run out of her home in the Maica area outside the city of Cochabamba.<p>\r\n\r\nBecause things became a bit crowded, Hilda began constructing an additional room so that her small general store could be relocated there.  It still needs a roof, so with this loan Hilda will purchase the construction materials she needs to finish it.  Then she will move her shop to the room which will allow her to then begin providing more goods for sale through the shop.  <p>\r\n\r\nHilda looks forward to the future and the opportunity to improve her quality of life once the relocation of her shop is complete."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":420830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"The

It has been 15 years since he began in this trade, because he knew how to drive an automobile, and it seemed to him that it would be quite easy.  But over time he has found that all work takes effort, and now he has to double his efforts because to be a father is a big commitment from which one can never escape.  On the contrary, he loves the time he spends with the apple of his eye. \r\n\r\n Juan likes to go out with his taxi during peak hours, when it is very profitable.  With this work, he does not have economic problems and he is able to raise enough money to live comfortably with his daughter.  He knows that he must give his best, and for this reason he is planning to buy another car in the future and offer it for rent.  His main concern is for the education and future of his daughter.

After the baby was born, Sara\u2019s son developed a serious case of bronchitis. Being a good mother, Sara began selling prepared meals during his recovery so that she could purchase his medicines and look after her daughter-in-law and grandchild. \r\n<p>\r\nEven though this was a difficult time, everything turned out well in the end. Sara continues to sell meals out of her home because she found it to be an easy and enjoyable way to make money.

It's been 10 years that both of them have worked in detailing and painting cars and their earnings have been good because more and more customers come to them for their vehicle repair needs.  Esperanza has always enjoyed this kind of work and she works shoulder to shoulder with the two helpers they hired despite what some may think that, being a woman, she would not be able to handle such heavy work.  But they would be very mistaken for she is very good at her job and she does it happily.  Therein lies her greatest strength in that it is her detailing work that turns out to be the best.  She enjoyes her work more than housework but this doesn't mean she doesn't do it too for she has two school-aged children to tend to.  Even so she finds the time to enjoy her favorite hobby, as she calls it, since she believes that more than a job, it is a pleasant hobby that she thoroughly enjoys doing.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very punctual with her repayments and with her group meetings.  With these funds she will buy supplies for car repair such as:  sheet metal, paint, putty, etc. to be able to offer better service to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":420918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase materials for her car repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-06T00:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":455.32},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":466.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":484.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":507.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":552.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.36,"local_amount":455.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":462.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843163,"comment":null},{"amount":322.69,"local_amount":921.97,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":935.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734745,"comment":null},{"amount":10.2,"local_amount":29.15,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":29.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124104,"comment":null},{"amount":177.46,"local_amount":507.01,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":514.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959810,"comment":null},{"amount":186.87,"local_amount":533.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":541.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992655,"comment":null},{"amount":193.42,"local_amount":552.62,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":560.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717438,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T13:18:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150085,"name":"Josue Omar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio JOSUE OMAR, pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROGRESO DE LOS ANDES\u201d, es natural de la ciudad del Cusco.\n\nEl socia tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, vive actualmente en la ciudad del Cusco, el es bachiller en administraci\u00f3n de empresas y trabaja en la entidad bancaria Scotiabank, el tiene 2 a\u00f1os ejerciendo su profesi\u00f3n, el socio necesita el cr\u00e9dito para poder implementar una oficina para vender tarjetas de celulares pre pago y hacer llamadas virtuales, necesita comprar muebles, computadoras, etc.\n\nEl socio se encuentra agradecido por la oportunidad brindada mediante este medio y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir con el pago correspondiente al cronograma.  \n","en":"\r\n\r\nJOSUE OMAR, 38, is a member of the \u201cPROGRESO DE LOS ANDES\" communal bank.

Her companions are a group of people who are trying to improve their social and economic situations and have formed a strong friendship with respect and mutual aid which helps their families get ahead..\r\n\r\nMrs. Ana O. is one of the most cheerful members of the communal bank La Paz.  She lives in Quinta Chica, an area of the city. She is 46, the single mother of 3: 25, 24 and 19.  Her oldest son works and helps her with the household expenses.  The second is a married daughter, and her last is a son, a student at the University of Azuay.  Their father only educated the oldest and youngest.  The house that they live in belongs to her, thanks to her hard work.\r\n\r\nAna goes around the Central Market of Cuenca selling fruit, vegetables, fish, etc. depending on the season. She has been doing this for the past seven years and she says that she has good days and bad days, but you have to keep going to get ahead. She also knits sweaters which she sells to her friends and neighbors in the area.  Ana was a member of the communal bank for two years, then she left.  She then returned and this is her third cycle working again with the bank.  She assures us that the profits that she has earned she has  invested in her business. With the new loan that the institution has offered her, she will buy different fruit and  vegetables to better supply her business and to attract more customers\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":420882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy assorted fruit and vegetables to better supply her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-06T03:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":151.14,"local_amount":147.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":151.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789439,"comment":null},{"amount":73.85,"local_amount":72.21,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":73.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679896,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679897,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679898,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074459,"comment":null},{"amount":225.02,"local_amount":220.02,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":225.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910456,"comment":null},{"amount":74.96,"local_amount":73.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":74.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946065,"comment":null},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674468,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-08T00:18:51Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150098,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elena es una mujer perseverante y activa, vive en la ciudad D.

M. is from the village of Palacapao, Quezon Bukidnon. She is 38 years old. Marites is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling rice and corn in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marites joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Marites is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

The parents endure hardships and difficulty to earn a living for the sake of their children.\r\n\r\nAs a way of gaining income,  Arnel uses his jeepney to provide taxi services.

It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty.
