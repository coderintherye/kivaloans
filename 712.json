In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine Pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the unit. His regular customers are members of the local community. He earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue his business operations, Alfredo is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in his business. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nAlfredo hopes his business grows into a mini-grocery store and he dreams to be able to give his children a good, high quality education through all his hard work on the business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He expects his high transportation costs to go down with the funding from Juhudi Kilimo.\n\nHe mentions that transportation is very costly for farm produce, so the motorcycle will help him with cheaper delivery of his produce to the market.

 She lives in the town of Ijevan.  She is married and has three children: two sons and a daughter.  The daughter and oldest son live with their families and separately from Lyudmila, and the youngest son and his family live with the parents.  Lyudmila's husband is a retiree.  She and her husband have been involved in agriculture since 1990.  With their joint efforts, they breed cattle, pigs and chickens.  They also grow vegetables and fruits.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Phylis will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nPhylis is pictured with her group members in the above photograph. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":915230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phylis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":47600,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T10:24:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356832,"name":"Anabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anabel is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Josephine is the facilitator of the Imara A group. This group joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nJosephine is a mother of three children. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Josephine had an excellent maize yield harvesting 20 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Josephine was only able to harvest eight bags of maize on one acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Josephine and her group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Josephine will educate her children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Imara A group will each plant between \u00bd and one acre of maize. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":902871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":84000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T03:47:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356847,"name":"Shavkat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0428\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0415\u043c\u0443 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u0428\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044e\u043c\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432.","en":"Shakvat lives in the city of Tursun-zoda.

Her farm produces beans, maize and milk, which all go to the local market.  She has been in farming for 20 years.  She is 38 years old, married, and has three children who are all in school.  She also sells cereals at the local market.  The cereals are sourced from her farm and from other farmers in the area.\r\n\r\nMary has requested a loan of 30,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a bull cart. This is her second loan request through Juhudi, after repaying the first loan of 20,000 KES promptly.

He hopes the farming business will help boost his clothing business to wholesale levels. Fredrick mentions that poor infrastructure, coupled with limited finances, are his major challenges.\r\n\r\nHe says the income from the two businesses will help him with his children's education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":209.43,"image":{"id":915362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy poultry birds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T02:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3276.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3831.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6055.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244602386,"comment":null},{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":5101.27,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5148.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250816839,"comment":null},{"amount":55.63,"local_amount":5236.11,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5284.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257226010,"comment":null},{"amount":35.85,"local_amount":3374.52,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3405.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263364215,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T15:01:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356940,"name":"Maristela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maristela tiene 40 a\u00f1os D. edad, es madre soltera D. un hijo.\n\nElla se dedica a la costura D. ropa y a la elaboraci\u00f3n D. pupusas.

married and has an adult daughter, Marina, who is 20 years old.  They live in Nikipol.  Yelena is involved in retail sales of children's clothing.  She always carries quality merchandise to satisfy every budget and taste, and this is why her merchandise is always in demand, and she has regular customers.  Yelena started her business 11 years ago.  At that time, she worked at a market, but then transferred her sales from the market to a store.  Now her merchandise does not get worn and dirty, and she has more space to display the clothing.  Besides, Yelena carefully selects the merchandise she buys and, thus, established herself as an experienced and diligent entrepreneur.  Yelena needs financial assistance in the form of a loan of 6,000 hryvnia to pay for her daughter's second semester of university study.  Yelena does not have such a large sum on hand, but the payment needs to be made right away and in full.  Obtained funds will help Yelena to pay for her daughter's education directly, and then she will be able to repay the loan gradually.  Being a single mother, Yelena understands that she has no one to count on and, hence, relies on the loan from Kiva.

Cristobal is the only breadwinner in the family.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Cristobal is a fisherman.  For the past 15 years, he has been fishing on Lake Yojoa.  He goes fishing on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from 6am to 5pm.  Cristobal sells his fish to merchants who have vending posts next to the lake.  The lake is very picturesque and surrounded by mountains.  On the shore of the lake, there are many restaurants that serve fried fish.  The fish from this lake is known for being the most flavorful in Honduras.  \r\n<p>\r\nCristobal requested 5000 HNL in his previous loan from ODEF.  Now he wants to acquire a little more equipment and amenities for his fishing business.  Cristobal is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 HNL so that he can repair his boat and purchase equipment.  He hopes to generate more income so that he can cover the family expenses.  In the future, Cristobal wants to open a stand where he can sell food.      \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":109.63,"image":{"id":915417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to repair his boat and to buy equipment.

They live together in their own house. \r\n\r\nAngela sells meals, and has a restaurant that she opened in her own home, that she set up five years ago through a lot of effort and dedication. That was thanks to the first loan that she had with MFP, and since then, she has succeeded in attracting customers. Sometimes her son helps with the work, but normally there is a girl who she has hired to help her with the hard work in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is having her own business, and an income to help with the household expenses. In addition, she likes to feel productive.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to improve the infrastructure of her business by installing a cement floor; this way she will manage to provide more comfort for her customers. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP. She feels happy to have this financial support, as this way she will feel sure of moving forward in her business. Moreover, she is committed once again to making her instalment payments. \r\n\r\nWith the amount applied for, she will repair the floor in the restaurant, in the main room, and in the kitchen.
