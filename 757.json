Tamarakhan worked as an accountant at the local collective farm, and is now retired. In 1981, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Tamarakhan started her own business in animal husbandry with a starting capital of 10,000 somi (KGS). Thanks to hard work and perseverance, Tamarakhan's farm now brings in about 5,000 somi per month. To increase her quantity of livestock, Tamarakhan has come to Bitushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 somi (KGS) to purchase more livestock and forage. This will enable her to expand her farm and increase the quantity of livestock, thus making it, in her view, the best capital investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":981197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock and forage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Pervomaiskoe village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamarakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T15:51:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380705,"name":"Bizoza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Beatrice fait partie du groupe Bizoza.

In 2002, after a difficult divorce from her spouse, Natalya realized that she needed an additional source of income for her family, aside from work as a seller at a local grocery store. Investing 20,000 som (KGS) as start-up capital, Natalya started her livestock breeding business. Currently, her business brings in approximately 8,000 som in sales of dairy and meat products. In order to further expand her business, Natalya has asked Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a cow and feed.

Together they have 4 children. They have their own house where they live happily. Since he was a child his parents taught him to work on the farm, now he is a farmer and he has his own land where he grows cocoa trees. He has been working his own land for the past 15 years. During harvest times he has help from his children and other hired laborers to be able to pick the fruit more quickly. What he likes most about his work is harvesting his plants because he can see that his months of hard work have resulted in the reward of good fruit. The hardest thing is to transport his products from the farm to the warehouse that is located in the city of San Francisco; this is where he is able to get the best price for his grains and pineapples. His difficulty is that he does not have enough economic income to be able to cover the advance payments to the hired laborers that help him during the harvest. It is for this reason that he came to the institution of MFP. But right now what is of higher priority is to plant more cocoa trees in a hectare of uncultivated land that he has. This will be his first loan with MFP. Evaristo feels that the money from this loan will help him greatly in the progress of his work. In his community bank he is a member that is very well liked by the rest of the members; he is well integrated with them. With the loan of 1,500 nuevos soles he is going to buy cocoa trees, which will increase his production. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":981535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cocoa plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaristo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T19:24:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380868,"name":"Evelyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyne is 27 years old.

In this way, her children will have a better quality of life with economic stability that permits them to afford the best education possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.7,"image":{"id":981684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to improve the facility, expanding her worksite, and to buy raw materials in order to carry through with a contract that she has with a client\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":59456},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":61130},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62850},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64619},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66438},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":68308},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":70231},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":72208},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":74240},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":76330},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":78478},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":80687},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":82958},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":85293},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87694},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90162},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":92700},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95309},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97992},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100750},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103586},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":106501},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":109499},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":112581}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.7,"local_amount":59456,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":60104.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362161,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T17:01:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380935,"name":"Hector","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio se sigue dedicando al negocio de transporte,el tiene un carro que hace servicio de transporte,el socio trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 7:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio el socio quiere salir adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o del socio es tener un carro nuevo.El  socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar repuestos y llantas para su carro.\n El socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n","en":"The member continues working in the transport business.

That is how he decided to select a line to launch in the market.  This line was children\u2019s and women\u2019s sandals.  \r\n\r\nHe distributes them through his daughter in the city of Cali.  He also makes boots that he sells in the capital of Colombia, Bogot\u00e1.  He enjoys great acceptance from his customers in the surrounding stores.  He visits them to offer his products.\r\n\r\nHe currently does not have sufficient working capital.  His customers increase, and he needs to always respond quickly.

The farm, which started with the sum of 5,000 som (KGS) back in 1996, today counts one dairy cow and five sheep and brings in around 6,500 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. In order to further increase the livestock numbers, Djumakish sought help from Bai Tushum & Partners and asked for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).

Having started 13 years ago by buying sheep valued at 5,000 KGS, Saltanat has been able to expand her business, which now brings in a monthly revenue of 5,000 KGS from the sale of meat and dairy products. In order to further increase her livestock, Saltanat turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS. Saltanat plans to invest the resulting revenues in continuing to increase her live stock, and in the future she plans to buy a car for her family.

She started her business in animal husbandry 20 years ago with an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, Jukunay's business yields about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.  She also works on 3.12 hectares of land, where she grows potatoes and barley.  In the summer, Jukunay and her family travel to the pastures (\"jailoo\") of the mountain lake Son-Kol, where they set up a \"yurt\" - national felt house - where tourists and visiting guests can stop.  In order to further develop her animal husbandry business, Jukunay requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase three bulls and ten sheep.  She plans to invest the profits into further increasing livestock
