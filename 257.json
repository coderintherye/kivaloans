A. is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Mulifanua Fou 3.  She is married and has six school-aged children.  To make a living, Mariarosa owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruit and vegetables for sale.  Mariarosa has been engaged in this business for more than 3 years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mariarosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mariarosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Mariarosa is now requesting a new loan of 1600 WST, which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mariarosa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

M. is a 34-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiusu T.  She is married and has 0 school-aged children.  To make a living, Va owns and operates a handicraft business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Va has been engaged in this business for more than 2 years.\r\n\r\nVa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Va has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  Va is now requesting a new loan of 1100 WST, which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Va plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T.  is a 54-year-old woman living in the town of Malie JA.  She is married and has 9 adult-aged children.  To make a living, Teu owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruit and vegetables for sale.  Teu has been engaged in this business for more than 4 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Teu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Teu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1300 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Teu is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the seventh loan that Teu has taken out from SPBD.  Teu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

 P. is a 20-year-old woman.  She lives in the town of Moataa.  She is married.  To make a living, Tifa owns and operates a business venture. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from baking and selling pudding products in the local community.  Tifa  has been engaged in this business for over a year.  From these activities, Tifa  earns approximately 200 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tifa  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tifa  is requesting her first loan from SPBD, for 1000 WST.  This loan will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients.  Tifa  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. Tofilau is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Moataa.  She is married and has 4 adult-aged children.  To make a living, Lomialagi S. owns and operates a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.  Lomialagi S. has been engaged in this business for more than 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lomialagi S. joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lomialagi S. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.  Lomialagi S. is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings.  The loan will be the fourth loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Lomialagi S. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is a 34-year-old woman living in the town of Satapuala. She is married and has 3 young children. To make a living, Leone makes and sells baked goods in the local community. Leone has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nLeone joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leone has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Leone is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be Leone's 3rd loan from SPBD. Leone plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S.  is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Tulaele.  She is married and has 3 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Tise owns and operates a business venture, making and selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fried food  in the local community.  Tise has been engaged in this business for more than 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nTise joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tise has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to renovate the business.  Tise is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  The loan will be the fourth loan that Tise has taken out from SPBD.  Tise plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay her childrens'  tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. is a 64-year-old woman living in the town of Toamua. She is married and has 7 adult children.  To make a living, Susana owns and operates a clothing business in her community. Susana just started her business and she earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nSusana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Susana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional equipment and tools, such as needles and thread. Susana is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to renovate her business. This will be Susana's third loan from SPBD. Susana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her house.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S., age 49, lives in the town of Matautu Lefaga Tai.

Faapopo has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 650 WST per month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Faapopo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve  her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Faapopo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals.  \r\n<p>\r\nFaapopo is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 1,500 WST, which will be used to build shelter for her livestock. The loan will be the second loan she has taken out from SPBD. Faapopo plans to use the additional revenue she expects the loan to generate to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M., age 31, lives in the town of Matautu Lefaga Tai.

Vailaasia has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Vailaasia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Vailaasia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  \r\n<p>\r\nVailaasia is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be the second loan she has taken out from SPBD. Vailaasia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Malae has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Malae joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malae has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Malae is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out Malae from SPBD.  Malae plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This will be Otila's 5th loan from SPBD. She repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST that she used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Her new loan of 2450 WST will also be used to purchase fertilizer. Otila plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She plans to use the additional revenue to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n<br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":367851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase raw

Naite has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\r\n\r\nNaite joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. This will be Naite's 4th loan from SPBD. She most recently repaid a loan of 2250 WST that she used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. She will use this loan of 2750 WST to purchase more raw materials and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n<br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. (0) is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiusu. She is married and has five school-aged children.\r\n\r\nSolialii owns and operates a handicraft business, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 450 WST a month.\r\n\r\nSolialii joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,200 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.\r\n\r\nSolialii is now requesting a new loan of 2,950 WST which will again be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The loan will be her 5th from SPBD.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has seven school-aged children.\r\n\r\nKoleta owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting bananas for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nKoleta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD.

The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nLita is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 450 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Pepe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.\r\n\r\nPepe is now requesting a new loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Vaea  is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Mulivai Leauvaa.  She is married and has 10 school-aged children.  To make a living, Sesilia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sesilia has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 800 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sesilia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sesilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1200 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  Sesilia is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Sesilia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T.  is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Tuanai A.  She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Palepa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Palepa has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Palepa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Palepa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Palepa is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.   Palepa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Tiavea A.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Fofoaivaoese owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Fofoaivaoese has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fofoaivaoese joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fofoaivaoese has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  Fofoaivaoese is now requesting a new loan of 1200 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Fofoaivaoese plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

N.  is a 71-year-old woman living in the town of Ulutogia.  She is married and has 8 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Mamaioa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mamaioa has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Mamaioa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mamaioa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Mamaioa is now requesting a new loan of 3500 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mamaioa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

she was young, Ruzigul N.  has enjoyed the countryside. Her family dedicated themselves to cultivating fruits and vegetables and Ruzigul always imagined she\u2019d be in the business of selling produce.  Fortunately she has realized this dream. She began to sell vegetables in small markets.  Little by little, she saved money so she could set up her own shop. Thanks to her efforts and the love she has for this business, Ruzigul\u2019s business has been growing. Now Ruzigul believes it is the time to inject more capital into the business so that she can buy at wholesale and obtain better prices.  She is soliciting a loan of 1500 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Through her income from her shop, she was also able to put up a sari-sari store (community-based store).  She is doing her best to improve her businesses and as much as possible without depending too much on her children because she believes they will also have their own families in the future and it is good for them to start saving money.  Despite her age, Flora is still active and showing her strong determination to succeed in her own simple way. All she wants now is to have a sustainable business that will benefit her children and grandchildren someday.

When Sanavar got married, she stayed home for almost 2 years.  Her husband was against her selling at the market.  When he left to go work in Russia, Sanavar's mother helped with money.  With time, Sanavar convinced her husband to let her go and help her mother with the sales.

Liezel Camerinl is 37 years old. She is married to Mr. Aaron C. and lives in Central Tabao, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. The couple have been blessed with one child who is now 16 years old.\r\n\r\nLiezel used to be a plain housewife who depended on her husband's income to cover their  household expenses, but she noticed that sometimes her husband's income was not enough for their needs. This made her think of ways to help her husband support their family. When she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005, she decided to sell fish and \"ginamos,\" a local delicacy made from salted and fermented krill, to the surrounding communities and around the town. It now earns her PHP 13,000 per month. Her earnings have made a big impact on improving her family's quality of life and she has even started saving for her child's college education.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. is now borrowing PHP 17,000 to increase her working capital and enable her to expand her business. This is Liezel C.'s 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

She lacks the money to pay for her children\u2019s education.  With the help of her grown children, she hopes to increase the volume of crops that are planted.  When it comes to marketing her products, Basilia is an astute saleswoman because the consumers in Tarma are very knowledgeable.

Por eso, en aras de incrementar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos se ha avocado tambi\u00e9n a la siembra de flores, las cuales son muy rentables en los meses de mayo y octubre, pues llega a sacar m\u00e1s de lo previsto. Dependiendo de c\u00f3mo se encuentre el mercado, llega a vender la docena a 80 soles, en el caso de cada paquete (como nos muestra en la foto), los vende entre 6 a 7 soles. Entonces prefiere sembrar justo para que cosechar en las fechas de mayor demanda, ya que de ese modo ayuda econ\u00f3micamente a su madre y a su hermana menor en sus estudios, y eso lo llena de mucha satisfacci\u00f3n. Esta es la primera vez que tiene la oportunidad de acceder a un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y es debido a la invitaci\u00f3n de un integrante de un banco comunal quien lo recomend\u00f3. Por lo que Marcos hace compromisos de adherirse a las reglas y pagar puntualmente todas sus cuotas.

He lives with his mother and his sister whom he loves a lot. Five years ago he started to plant flowers (gladiolus) on his mother\u2019s small farm and other times on rented land. Since he was 18 he has grown peas which has gone very well. Therefore, in the interest of increasing his income, he started to plant flowers. The flowers are very profitable in the months of May and October, and he has earned more than he foresaw. Depending on how the market is, he can sell a dozen flowers for 80 soles. Each package (as he shows us in the photo) sells for 6 or 7 soles. Therefore he prefers to plant so that he harvests in the times of highest demand since he financially helps his mother and his younger sister in her studies, which gives him great satisfaction. This is the first time that he has had the opportunity to access a loan with MFP and it is due to the invitation of a member of a community bank who recommended him. Marcos commits to adhering to the rules and being punctual in all of his payments.

He lives in his own house with his wife and their 4 children. Since he was a child, he has grown potatoes, peas, and, in a smaller quantity, corn. Now, as an adult, he earns extra income by plowing his neighbors\u2019 farms with his in-laws\u2019 bulls. The activity earns him between 50 to 60 soles per day, depending on the land. From these earnings, which are distributed evenly between Miler and his in-laws, Miler only receives a third. This is because his in-laws offer him their support with their farms and their bulls. He plows all of his neighbors\u2019 farms happily and quickly, so that he is available to pursue other work with his neighbors\u2019 crops and to cover his household expenses. This is his fifth loan with MFP, where he has demonstrated a dignified responsibility. He is grateful for his community bank, where he was the treasurer.

For him, cultivating crops requires a lot of responsibility, so he is dedicated to succeed and to have good harvests. For this, he takes care of his crops with a lot of dedication; he fertilizes his crops and removes the land every time it is necessary. To get to his crops, however, his biggest challenge is to obtain a truck to transport the sacks of potatoes, since getting to the largest market in the city takes him an hour, and he must pay 2 soles for each sack. Other than that, he is very happy with his work, since he shares his earnings with his parents and siblings and also because he can get what he needs for the next harvest. This is his first loan with MFP, and he is very motivated to get involved in his community bank, so he promises to comply with all of the rules and repayments. Also, he is very thankful to the person who invited him to be part of the group, and he has promised this person that he will not default on the loan. With the money that he is requesting, Walter plans to invest in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for his crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":368307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-12T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":735,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-12T22:56:57Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128360,"name":"Tika Llajta Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los miembros del grupo \u201cTikallajta\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Margot y conformada por 12 miembros los cuales tienen diferentes actividades como la venta D. bebidas en licorer\u00edas, atenci\u00f3n en caf\u00e9s Internet, venta D. cristaler\u00eda, artesan\u00edas, cosm\u00e9ticos, abarrotes en tiendas D. barrio, elaboraci\u00f3n D. masitas y al servicio D. limpieza y pintura decorativa para casas.

She is married and has seven school-age children. To make a living, Tulagalua owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting cocoa for sale. Tulagalua has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Tulagalua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tulagalua has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Tulagalua is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This will be the second loan she has taken out from SPBD. Tulagalua plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD: <br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

K. is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiafai. She is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Fagalele owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Fagalele has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Fagalele joined SPBD to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fagalele has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Fagalele is now requesting a new loan of 1100 WST, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. This will be the second loan she has taken out from SPBD. Fagalele plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and\/or expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD: <br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This micro-entrepreneur travels all around the city of Bluefields offering his product mainly at primary schools, where many of the students buy sandwiches and hot dogs during recess.\r\n\r\nWe should point out that El\u00edas Jos\u00e9 has already received his first loan from Kiva.  He used the money to buy more ingredients to make his food and has enjoyed increased sales.  However, household expenses have gone up, so he needs a loan to purchase more ingredients including:  \r\n\r\n6 gallons of mayonnaise at US$15.00\/gallon, 30 loaves of bread at US$1.20\/loaf, 1 tank

He has a son who is of school-age, and he has worked for the past 15 years in the MINSA de Rama as a hospital assistant.  He is requesting his fifth loan to help him improve his home by putting tile over the floor, which measures 7x7 meters, and is currently made of dirt.  By tiling the floor, he would be able to offer better living conditions to his family; as it is now, the winter weather turns the floor to mud at the entrance to his home.  In addition to this, if the loan allows, he would like to make a small porch for his house.  In this manner, bit by bit adding to his house, he hopes to acquire the basic amenities of a proper home for his family.  It should be noted that Don Agustin has used the previous loans granted to him in order to improve his home, as he has stated.  Don Agustin's greatest wish is to be able to have a completed, beautiful home which his family may in time inherit from him.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva

Eager to help her husband in earning money to sustain their family needs, her hopes of having access to capital to start a business materialized.

Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 40 pieces of bamboo beds, 2 bamboo sets, 40 kilos of assorted dried fish, all for resale, and a gallon of cooking oil, sugar, bananas, and pork for her food vending business.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can reach her dreams of sending her children to school, having a rolling store, and repairing her house to make

A., 33 years old, hails from the island village in the town of Binagonan, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is married to Willardo and mother to two boys. She is a very industrious and hard-working mother. Her dream is to bring her family out of poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nWith her determination to rise above poverty, Cecilia joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and now KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2004. With her membership in ASHI, she hoped to have capital for her planned business. Her previous loans were used to pay for fishing gear that they sell to fishermen.  Just year ago, she shifted her business into having her own fish cage, where she raised fish until ready to harvest and sell at the market. She noticed that this business is more productive than her previous one.<P>\r\n\r\nJust recently, Cecilia is requesting a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish-cage business. Specifically, to pay for 2 bundles of nets, 30 pieces bamboos, fingerlings worth 5,400 pesos and to pay for labor and food for the laborer. <P>\r\n\r\nCecilia is hopeful that she can reach her dreams in the near future, considering that ASHI and KIVA are giving her trust and confidence. She dreams of having a bigger fish-cage, sending her children to school, and also repairing her house so it is more spacious and more durable.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":368551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for 2

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here is a story about Gulsaada, a fifty-three-year-old widow, who is the leader of this group. Having raised three sons, she still lives with two of them. Gulsaada married off her eldest son and now he lives separately. Her second son works in a local market, whereas her youngest son still goes to school. As for herself, Gulsaada is engaged in raising, feeding, and resale of cattle. This activity enables her to provide for the family's needs. Her youngest son, apart from going to school, also helps her look after the cattle. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter buying two sheep for about ninety dollars, six years have passed during which keeping cattle has been their main source of income. They have even saved enough money to buy a big TV and a fridge. Currently they are keeping a cow, two calves and four sheep. All this allows them to make seventy dollars a month. Gulsaada would really be happy if she were able to get a loan as she needs some funds to be able to buy three or four sheep.   <P>\r\n\r\nAigerim, Rustam, and Alina are Gulsaada\u2019s partners. In spite of their young age they are already making their first adult steps toward accomplishing their plans. Aigerim, 23, is engaged in selling flowers. She has a decent income, namely around US$ 360, so her plan is to lease another flower shop for about US$ 170, and equip it. <P>\r\n\r\nRustam, 19, is unmarried. He sells foodstuffs: vegetables, soft drinks, milk products, and also detergents. He started business at ten years of age. Now he earns US$ 360-400 a month. He would be happy to obtain a loan to purchase a certain amount of potatoes, onions, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers and soft drinks.<P>\r\n\r\nAlina, 20, is also unmarried. She is occupied with selling foodstuffs, candies, cakes, etc. She started business about a year ago when her mother bought her a small shop. Now Alina\u2019s monthly income is US$ 300-360. She needs a loan to purchase tobacco products and soft drinks. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<p>\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Atyrkul is thirty-eight years old. Being a mother to three sons, she lives the humble life of a shepherd\u2019s wife. Twenty years ago, her husband inherited some cattle from his parents and since then, he has been raising cattle and working as a shepherd. <P>\r\n\r\nAtyrkul, being a housewife, takes care of the household. She also actively helps her husband look after their cattle. Her daily routine begins with milking cows in the morning, then selling the milk to her neighbors. Besides cows, they keep some other livestock, too. So, Atyrkul has always a lot to do around the house. <P>\r\n\r\nHaving lived all her life in a rural area, she decided to send her eldest son to college, to live in the city. Two other sons live at home and help their parents. By selling some of their livestock, they managed to buy a house, though Atyrkul\u2019s monthly income from selling milk is just US$ 65. <P>\r\n\r\nNow, Atyrkul is desperate to buy another cow. One more cow means more milk for sale, consequently more daily income to save for their second son\u2019s education. For villagers every liter of milk is valuable, since it brings cash, which is a rare thing in a village area.<P>\r\n\r\nHere are Atyrkul\u2019s partners: Amanbu, Altyn and Nazira. Amanbu is fifty. With her husband she keeps livestock: one cow and twenty sheep. Her husband is an electrician, but Amanbu, being a housewife, meets her daily needs by selling milk. Now, Amanbu wants to get a loan to buy a calf and with the rest of the loan she would purchase sheep for fattening and resale. <P>\r\n\r\nAltyn is twenty-five. She is married and has three children. To help her husband, who is a welder, she sells foodstuffs and earns US$ 130. She needs a loan to include more vegetables, fruit, and salads in her assortment. <P>\r\n \r\nNazira is twenty-three. She is not married yet. However, for five years already she has lived independently in terms of finances, as she has been selling newspapers, magazines and some detergents. Nazira needs a loan to open a small shop to sell detergents out of. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<P>\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is 38 years old. Her husband is raises livestock. They have three children. Their son and daughter are 19 and 17 respectively and the smallest child is just 3 years old. Apart from taking care of her baby, Cholpon keeps a cow and sells its milk to purchasers. Cholpon\u2019s brother, working in Russia, once sent her money, with which she was able to buy five cows. Gradually she and her husband saved enough money to pay Cholpon\u2019s brother back. This is due to their 20-year experience in cattle breeding. Raising livestock, Cholpon and her husband have been able to buy some furniture for their house as well as some household equipment. Now, they need to obtain a loan. With this loan they would get an opportunity to purchase calves to send to mountain pastures, keep them and then resell after bringing them back. They want to increase the total population so that after selling some of the livestock they would be able to pay for their son\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nHere is Cholpon\u2019s team: Asilbek, Kadicha and Halima. Asilbek, 44, rents a piece of land, where he grows watermelons, onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Farming helps him provide for his wife and five children. Now he is in need of a loan to purchase fertilizers to grow more crops.\r\n\r\nKadicha, 49, is married and has raised seven children! Most of her children have gone to Russia for work. As for Kadicha, she sells vegetables: onions, potatoes and carrots. Kadicha needs a loan as she wants to begin selling fruit and thus expand her offerings. She also requests this loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nHalima, 26, is married and has one child. Her husband does odd jobs at a construction site, whereas she keeps two cows and sells milk and yogurt. They want to increase the amount of milk for sale by buying one more cow. To do that, the only way is to get a loan. They have already built a new shed for that. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept -- People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Now they are are all of legal age.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with hopes of having access to capital to start a business. Her previous loans were prudently utilized as rolling capital on her business of basket making made from bamboo. The business was tiring, laborious and time consuming considering her age. That is why, just recently, she shifted and ventured into a new business: the resale of charcoal and dressed chicken.\r\n\r\nNow on her tenth loan, she requests loan of 45,000 pesos as additional capital for her primary business of reselling charcoal and dressed chicken. Specifically, the loan will use to pay for 200 sacks of charcoal and 100 kilos of dressed chicken plus labor and transportation expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that her business will grow and may have space in the market.

(Remy) lives in the village of Madiangat in Quezon Nueva Vizcaya. She is married to Ruben and they have been blessed with two children: Verfred - 5 years old and Merliza - 2 years old. Remy and her husband are looking forward to a bright future for their children.  \r\n\r\nTo further help her husband earn a living for their family, Remy started a snack vending business. She sells cooked snacks like soup, \u201cpancit\u201d (noodles) and sometimes she also sells vegetables. Aside from farming, her husband also works as a part-time house carpenter in their village.

Th\u1ecb operates a family member's business providing general services to local community members. She is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Li\u00ean is married and has two school-age children. Li\u00ean has been in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1,800,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Li\u00ean joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities.  Li\u00ean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her seventh loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Li\u00ean plans to use the additional revenue to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nLi\u00ean (19) is the leader of a four member group accessing a loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 022 -Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.05.022).\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n1.  N. Th\u1ecb Huy\u1ec1n  is a 31-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business in the services sector (50).\r\n2.  H.

L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Hoa is a 26-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business making and selling food (17).\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nLi\u00ean N.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":368601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To improve the quality of her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam O.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105855,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022965,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868206,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757402,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146496,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984641,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-13T05:15:12Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128517,"name":"Z.

This is Aziza S. from Mbozi. She is 31, married and has one 6 year old child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphan.\r\nAziza has been selling used clothing and drinks since 2007. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers such as Aziza, who re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\nShe works 13 - 16 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by one employee and by her husband. Aziza currently earns about 210USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more clothes and drinks in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Aziza thanks you for your support!\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":368607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more clothes and drinks in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T03:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziza R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105856,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022966,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868207,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757403,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146497,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":104935.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984642,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-14T02:13:18Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128522,"name":"H.

A. is the picture of a woman who is very determined to cut the ties of poverty that hinder her way to success. She believes that business is a starting step to achieve something higher, provided it is properly managed. Now on her third loan, she is requesting 15,000 pesos as additional capital for her fishing business. Specifically, the loan will pay for two bundles of fishnets, 60 pieces of bamboo, and for the repair of her fish cage.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is a native of the island town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is married to Apolinario, who is a 57-year-old fisherman. She is the mother of two daughters: her elder daughter, Helen, is 35 years old and her younger daughter, Mary Ann, is 18 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, she joined Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with high hopes and aspirations to have access to capital for her business. Her previous loans were used as rolling capital for her fishing business and also, partly, as capital for her secondary sewing business. She is hopeful that with hard work and proper use of capital, she can make her business grow. She dreams of having more fish cages and her own sewing machine. She also wants to be able to improve her house into one more spacious and

This is 29-year-old Salome M. from Mbozi. She is married with two children, ages 4 and 6. Salome has been running a retail shop business since 2007.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":368633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase shop items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T06:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome A.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":368636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-13T07:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mygrate G.

Now she is applying for her first loan from Vision Finance Company in Rwanda for 500,000 Rwandan Francs. With this loan, she hopes to expand her business by buying more clothes for children and dishes for selling in order to get more profits than before. At this time, she is selling as a retailer because of poor investment but she hopes that once she gets the loan, it will permit her to sell as a retailer and wholesaler at the same time. By doing both operations, obviously she will get more profits than before. And with the increased profits, she expects to send her children to beautiful schools for higher education and get more food for her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her family members include a husband and three children. Her husband is an electrician working at the electric power station of Kant city. The eldest among her children is her daughter, who is a sophomore. Next is her son, an eleven-year-old youngster. The smallest is her next son, who is just two years old.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty hard to have three children and be an electrician. Nevertheless, Gulbara tries to help her husband as best as she can by selling milk. All these years she has been quite successful as she sells ten liters a day at twenty cents per liter, which is a significant source of income. Besides that, she sells eggs, a little over a dollar per ten eggs.\r\n\r\nGulbara needs to buy a two-chamber fridge for $440. However, considering the amount of money she and her husband earn, it is unlikely that they would ever be able to save money to do that. So, they hope that they will be able to get a loan.\r\n\r\nGulbara\u2019s partners are Suyunbek, Aigul, Sabyrkul and Uruila.\r\n\r\nSuyunbek is married and he has two children. While his wife looks after their children, he is occupied with raising livestock. He has been engaged in this business for thirteen years. He wants to obtain a loan and buy three sheep.\r\n\r\nAigul, 43, is the mother of seven children! Her husband sells motor oils in Bishkek city while Aigul is engaged in cattle breeding and selling milk. This activity has helped her support her family and marry her two daughters.\r\n\r\nSabyrkul, 53, is married and has four children. Both she and her spouse are farmers, growing and utilizing agricultural products. They obtained their land fifteen years ago from the local municipality. Sabyrkul needs a loan to purchase 150 bales of hay.\r\n\r\nUruila, 54, is married. Two years ago she saved some money and bought a milk cow. Now, selling milk brings her $55. She hopes to buy another cow to sell more milk.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As to Sainaya, she keeps two cows and sells their milk to the locals. Actually, one of her cows was given to her by her father and mother-in-law as a wedding gift.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her family live in Barangay Lamak Rizal, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. Ma. Fe ekes out a living for her family by selling fruits and vegetables. She admits that this is not an easy way to earn a living because it requires patience and a lot of hard work and dedication, but she is firm in her goal to help her husband move their family out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe has been an traveling fruit vendor for that last 10 years, going around the villages and neighboring towns selling different kinds of fruit, such as mangos, bananas, or whatever fruit is in season just to help her husband support their family and meet their basic needs. \r\n\r\nMa. Fe is thankful for the help of the loans she got from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She used the loans as capital for her fruit vending business, which now earns about PHP 5,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 16th loan, Ma. Fe is borrowing PHP 19,000 which she will again use as additional capital for her business so that she can pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Luzbella T. is a 59-year-old married woman with 9 children.

When she saw how heavy the burden was for her husband, she thought of ways of helping her husband, if only in just a small way, to lessen the burden of their family expenses.\r\n\r\nA fine cook, Luz, as she is commonly called, decided to make use of her skills and talents in cooking to supplement the income that her husband brings home. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 so that she could have access to unsecured or non-collateral loans to start her business, which currently nets PHP 2,000 per month on average.\r\n\r\nNow on her 11th loan cycle, Luz wants to borrow PHP 11,000 as additional capital for her food business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams.

in a hacienda (sugar plantation) is very tough. People work long hard hours for low wages that are not even enough to feed a family of four, much less a family with seven children. But Mrs. Marlyn C. of Hacienda Victoria, Tabao Rizal, San Enrique, Negros Occidental was determined to help her husband support their large family, and send her children to school.\r\n\r\nFor the past twelve years, since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marlyn has engaged in food vending, selling a variety of nutritious snack food such as sugar-coated fried bananas, commonly known as \"bananaque\" because the bananas are sold skewered on barbecue sticks, to her neighbors and the surrounding communities within the sugar plantation where she lives.\r\n\r\nIn addition to food vending, Marlyn has a \"sari-sari\" or general store which her husband manages while she goes around selling her snacks to the field workers and their neighbors. The income they jointly earn helps in sending the three youngest children to school.\r\n\r\nFor her 9th loan, Marlyn is borrowing Php 9,500 to purchase a \"trisikad\" - a bike with a side-car so that she can use to go around the neighboring communities a lot faster and reach further to sell her snack food. Some of the loan will be used as additional capital for her food-vending and for the \"sari-sari\" (general) store.\r\n\r\nExplaining the term \"trisikad\":\r\n\r\nFilipinos are fond of coining new terms for the practical gizmos we dream up. Some of you might have read some \"Only in the Philippines\" anecdotes - and the trisikad is another one of those. The term trisikad is a combination of an English and Hiliganon (a dialect in Western Visayas) word - tricycle because of the three wheels (the bike + sidecar) - but then the term tricycle is already used for motorcycles with sidecars so to distinguish it, and to emphasize that it is not motorized, the Hiligaynon word \"sikad\" meaning to kick or to pedal was used instead - resulting in the uniquely Ilonggo \"trisikad\".\r\n\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":371501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Jose Luis has worked as a driver for the MINSA del Rama for 9 years.  He is asking for refinancing on his sixth loan so he can renovate his living quarters. He stays at his parents' house in a small room in the garage.
