Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of

Maria del Pilar esta segura que con su apoyo ella podr\u00e1 hacer crecer su peque\u00f1o negocio.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":6021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Prchase basic, hygienic and milky products ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Monterrey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.666667 -100.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T01:51:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-23T07:56:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-02-03T17:21:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-17T10:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6184,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-02-03T17:27:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-17T10:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6224,"comment":null},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-03-17T10:32:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-17T10:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10282,"comment":"scheduled payment"}],"funded_date":"2006-12-09T07:56:45Z","paid_date":"2007-03-17T10:32:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":2230,"name":"Laura Margarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margarita is a young woman of 26 year-old; she is married  and  has two children of 7 and 4 years old respectively.

Last year was an extremely cold winter in Moldova reaching as low as -30 degrees Celsius and Elena saw higher sales than expected. Elana would like to be prepared for this winter.  Most people don\u2019t like the cold, but when its cold outside it means money for Elana.\r\n\r\nIn order to save money Elana purchases her clothing in bulk twice a year, once for winter and again for summer from the Ukraine.  Within the last year it has been more difficult to buy cloths from Ukraine due to the importers having to travel further distances around an area of Moldova called Transnistria.  Transnistria is a breakaway state from Moldova, it was unofficially formed after a civil war within Moldova in 1992 after the Soviet Union collapsed. This area is not recognized by the United Nations or the United States and last year, Ukraine and Moldova\u2019s Governments induced a blockade on this region requiring heavy restrictions for goods leaving this area. Elana would like a loan to make a larger purchase this year to have a larger inventory for this reason and to meet demand and help keep her customers warm!

He played throughout childhood, studied music at Burgas University for four years and was subsequently in the Bulgarian military band for two years (1972-1974) during the cold war. After completing his military service he was a part of the Bulgarian National Orchestra, a small group that was allowed to travel around the Eastern Block highlighting Bulgarian culture.  During this period, Mitko had to work hard to get copies of the music of his favorite Western musician, Louis Armstrong, as no Western music or books were allowed in Bulgaria. <p>\r\n\r\nAfter the state orchestra was dismantled, Mitko returned to his Roma neighborhood in Sliven.  (The Roma, often referred to as gypsies in the West, are a severely marginalized group on the Balkan Peninsula of Southeastern Europe.)

places in Moldova are booming with construction, both residential and commercial. The city of Cahul is no exception. People here spend much of their free time renovating and improving their homes or working on a new one. Cinder-block and wood structures can be seen everywhere and power tools are a common sound. Vasile understands the pride Moldovans feel for their homes and knows that proper construction requires good material inputs, so when he was thinking of going into business it was an easy choice to open a construction materials store. He located in the central market, where his goods catch the attention of many shoppers, and began by selling a number of products for construction and for the home in general. He has noticed that his construction related products sell best and that many clients ask for specific and high quality items, so Vasile has decided to specialize in things such as dry cement, tiles, plastering tools, etc. and to discontinue his stock of household detergents and other goods. To purchase a shipment of all the construction supplies he wants to carry, he needs a loan. This will allow him to purchase from a vendor in the capital city of Chisinau and receive the exact products he thinks will be popular.

is a busy lady, caring for her six children and also managing the family farmstead, which includes raising ducks, chickens, and production of various crops.

Two years ago she decided it would be profitable to construct two greenhouses in which to grow produce for sale and for her family\u2019s consumption. With the metal frames erected and covered in heavy-duty plastic, her summer crop of tomatoes and winter crop of radishes both flourished and sold well at the local and regional farmers\u2019 markets. Ana and her family use a tractor and a tank trailer to fetch water from the village fountain to irrigate their crops, just one step in a labor-intensive production system. This year, however, the poly-plastic greenhouse covering reached the end of its life expectancy and began to deteriorate. Ana now needs a loan to buy and install new covering over her greenhouse frames and also to make small repairs to the farm\u2019s tractor.

When her husband recently retired from being the village\u2019s dentist, a position he had filled for ten years, Nina decided it was a good time to fulfill her dream of opening a place for young people to socialize. To make a viable business she came to the idea of opening a pizzeria that would attract youngsters from the area. She wants it to be a positive and safe place for youth, with current music and inexpensive food. The latter goal will be met by purchasing frozen pizzas from a Moldovan company and preparing them as they are ordered. She is also planning to have ice cream and of course various drinks. The whole family has been helping with preparing everything necessary, including renovating the building, and will continue to be involved.

This job not only provides a secondary source of income, it allows her to purchase medicine in bulk at wholesale prices. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Kennys is seeking the loan because she wants to continue to invest in new products. She sees the Christmas as a golden opportunity to make a good amount of sales. She will buy sheets, toys and more drinks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Kennys is the 37 years old and has 8 children. She moved to Guayaquil from Esmeraldas, a city with a predominantly Afro community. She has always worked as a maid in households, but this new business venture has allowed her to quit those jobs. Due to the strenuous financial circumstances, none of her older children graduated from high school. They do help her run the business when she is at work.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

They get back on their minibus with bags of merchandise for the next week that evening, and are back in Sliven Tuesday morning.  <p>\r\n\r\nAneta focuses on dresses, which are predominately worn at Roma weddings and other major events.

In fact, this village is the source of vegetables for the hotels in Cap Skirring.  The dissatisfaction of the hotels and the fact that the demand exceeds the supply drives hotels, for example the Club Med, to purchase their fresh produce in Dakar [Senegal\u2019s capital, a two day\u2019s journey from Boucotte Ouolof].

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.

We also conduct commercial activities, selling local products that we produce ourselves, such as palm oil, oysters, clams, etc.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Le village de Effock, est un village en reconstruction apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9cu plus de 10 ann\u00e9es sous le feu de la guerre avec le probl\u00e8me en Casamance.\r\nEtant en reconstruction, les populations nous avons besoin d\u2019un soutien financier qui va nous aider \u00e0 bien mener nos activit\u00e9s   pour mieux affront\u00e9e cette nouvelle phase que nous entamons. <p>\r\n Objectifs du Pr\u00eat : Lutter contre l\u2019exode, dans le cadre de la reconstruction du village, am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des populations. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Notre activit\u00e9 principale est : le maraillage c\\\\\\'est-\u00e0-dire que nous achetons du poisson aupr\u00e8s des p\u00eacheurs du village et que nous revendons \u00e0 Oussouye, sur la route nationale aux passagers et aussi dans les structures h\u00f4telier.\r\nNous menons aussi des activit\u00e9s commerciales en vendant  des produits locaux que nous produisons nous m\u00eame tel que : huile de palme, hu\u00eetres, mollusques etc. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":6877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of seeds, gardening equipment, a scale; setting up a storeroom for the produce","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Hassouka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T20:08:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madeleine Djipoya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-26T22:12:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1375,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T22:13:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13125,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16925,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16941,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16957,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:57:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16973,"comment":null},{"amount":-375,"local_amount":-375,"processed_date":"2007-06-22T07:19:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":-375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24864,"comment":"This is a correction of a previous payment posted in error."},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41444,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50187,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63340,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80046,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93783,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106882,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2006-12-12T22:12:29Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":2483,"name":"Ibrahima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a group loan to be shared by the six members of the Yakaar association, represented by Ibrahima F..  The Yakaar group describes their business plan as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cContext:  In earlier times this peanut-growing valley flourished.  Plenty of rain fell during the wet seasons and harvests were abundant.  The livestock here never knew feeding problems and lived peacefully. <p>\r\nThen rainfall became scarce, the soils became poor, and the fields no longer provided nourishment for the families.  Poverty established itself definitively. <p>\r\nFaced with this situation, the Yakaar group plans to start a sheep-raising business.  In the season before the holiday of Tabaski [a Muslim holiday known outside West Africa as Eid al-Kabir or Eid al-Adha, in which each family slaughters a sheep to commemorate the story of Abraham\u2019s sacrifice], our region of Diourbel offers excellent opportunities for fattening sheep because it is located in a grazing area and peanut-growing valley.  It is a very favorable context for fattening and marketing rams.  The requested loan will allow us to purchase a number of purebred rams in very good health.  <p>\r\n\r\nOverall objective:  To increase the income of the group members with the profit earned from sheep-raising, and to reactivate the production and sale in the local market of quality meat. <p>\r\n\r\nActivities:  Sheep-raising workshop<p>\r\nActivity 1: this will consist of purchasing thirteen rams in Djolof, which offers good prices on the rams as well as assuring their good health. <p>\r\nActivity 2: Purchasing sheep feed for proper feeding and phytosanitary maintenance, for a duration of two months in order to fatten them<p>\r\nActivity 3: Phytosanitary treatment. <p>\r\nActivity 4: A herdsman will be hired to guard and care for the sheep during the entire two-month period. <p>\r\nActivity 5: Commercialization:  After two months of fattening (with special feed) and caring for the rams, we will proceed to market them exactly on the day before Tabaski for our first cycle \u2013 just at a time when the demand is very strong and the supply of good-quality rams is often quite limited.  A quality product must be competitive on the basis of both quality and price.  <p>\r\n\r\nA total of four cycles are planned for the coming year.  Each cycle will generate a profit of 180,000 francs [about $350], so by the end of the year profits will total 720,000 francs [about $1400].  <p>\r\n\r\nStrategy:  Our strategy begins with the purchase of purebred rams; with a good diversified feeding regimen, at the end of two months the rams will be quite sleek and will be successfully during the preparations leading up to the holiday.  We will set up a methodical process for providing the market and grilled meat stands with quality meat on a quarterly basis (four cycles per year).\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n \r\n\u201cContexte du projet :  Autrefois le bassin arachidier \u00e9tait florissant.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.

Represented by their leader Fatou Ba, this group describes their business activities as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe village of Loudia Ouoloff is located in the department of Oussouye and it is the capital of the district.

It will allow us to invest in projects that we villagers have created ourselves.  Our group has engaged in commercial activities for a long time, with a focus on purchasing and retailing various types of merchandise.  Our group also specialized in other areas such as weaving mats, making fruit and vegetable preserves, handmade brooms, etc.  In order to restart these activities, the group requests a loan to enable us to allow fruits and vegetables to be made into preserves, and to pay palm-wine makers to provide us with the palm fronds we need to make the brooms and weave mats.\u201d  <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French : <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: le village de Loudia Ouoloff est situer dans le d\u00e9partement de Oussouye et il\r\nEst un chef  lieu d\\'arrondissement, i compte plus de 4000  habitants vivant autour d\\'un chef de village \r\nEt en parfaite harmonie.\r\nLe village de Loudia  Ouoloff est distant de 9 Km de la capitale d\u00e9partemental ; ces populations vivent de l\u2019agriculture. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : L\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consiste \u00e0 avoir un fon de roulement afin de pouvoir relanc\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s du groupement.\r\nIl s\u2019agit entre autre de pouvoir financ\u00e9 les projets que se sont cr\u00e9er les villageois eux m\u00eame. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Le groupement m\u00e8ne depuis longtemps des activit\u00e9s commerciales dont la plus remarqu\u00e9e reste l\u2019achat et la vente de marchandise divers.\r\n En outre le groupement s\u2019est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres domaines tel que le tissage des nattes, la transformation de fruits et l\u00e9gumes, la confection de balais, etc.\u2026.\r\nPour ce faire, le groupement sollicite un financement lui permettant de pouvoir achet\u00e9 les fruits et l\u00e9gume pour la transformation, pay\u00e9 les r\u00e9colteurs de vin de palme afin qu\u2019il puissent mettre \u00e0 leur disposition les rames de palmier pour la confection des balais et le tissage des natte. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.

Represented by Fulom\u00e9ne S., the group submitted the following business description: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Gninkando association is a group of women of the village of Djicomol in the ecovillage of Mlomp.  The village has a population of over 10,000, which is why an agricultural enterprise is a good way to help the women take advantage of what their environment has to offer.  The purpose of our group is to strengthen solidarity between our members, to promote emancipation and to work for the development of the land within the areas of their target business activities.  The business activities proposed by the group are: <p>\r\n\u2022\tAgriculture: This consists of gardening, where the investment needs are: inputs (seeds, fertilizer, phytosanitary products), and equipment (watering cans, rakes, hoes, wheelbarrows, pitchforks, etc.) <p>\r\n\u2022\tCommerce:  This is our group\u2019s main business activity; using local produce grown by our group, the members market their products throughout the region, especially in the surrounding villages.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

is a group loan to be shared by the members of the Katakal women\u2019s association, represented by Salimata D..  The Katakal group describes their business activities: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Katakal association is a group of women from the village of Siganar.  The village has over 3,000 inhabitants, which is why an agriculture project is a good choice for helping the women to profit from the potentials of this region, from which they have earned income for over ten years.  The purpose of our group is to improve the living conditions of our members and increase their income.  The business activities planned by our group are: <p>\r\n\u2022\tAgriculture:  This is based on gardening, where the needs are: inputs (seeds, fertilizer, phytosanitary products), and equipment (watering cans, rakes, hoes, pitchforks, etc.) <p>\r\n\u2022\tCommerce:  This is the principal business activity of the group; the women take local products [i.e. fresh produce from their gardens, and perhaps handicrafts such as pottery or mats woven from palm fronds, etc.] produced by the members of the group and market them throughout the region of Ziguinchor.  They also make preserves out of fruits and vegetables.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\u201cContexte du Projet : Le groupement Katakal est un groupement de femmes du village de  Siganar  Sa population compte plus de 3000habitants et c\u2019est pourquoi un projet d\u2019agriculture viendra au point pour aider les femmes \u00e0 exploiter les potentiels du milieu qu\u2019elles exploitent depuis plus de 10 ans. <p>\r\n Objectifs du Pr\u00eat : l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par le groupement est : <p>\r\n-  D\u2019am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des membres du groupement et d\u2019augmenter leur revenus. <p>\r\n Activit\u00e9s : Les activit\u00e9s que se propose le groupement sont : <p>\r\n- L\u2019agriculture : elle est bas\u00e9e sur le mara\u00eechage ou les besoins sont : les intrants (semences engrais, produits phytosanitaire), et le petit mat\u00e9riel (arrosoirs, r\u00e2teaux, p\u00e8les, houes, brouettes fourches etc.\u2026) <p>\r\n- Le commerce : Il est le principal activit\u00e9 du groupement ; de par les produits locaux produits par les membres du groupement qui assure elles m\u00eame la commercialisation de leurs produits au niveau de toute la r\u00e9gion de Ziguinchor, elles font aussi la transformation des fruits et l\u00e9gumes. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

is a group loan to be shared by six women who hail from the village of Youtou in the southern region of Casamance.  Represented by group leader Maguette S., the group submitted this business proposal: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  Youtou is a village in reconstruction after having experienced more than ten years under the fire of war with the [separatist conflict] crisis in Casamance.  Being in reconstruction, we need financial support which will help us manage our enterprises properly in order to better face this new phase that we are beginning. <p>\r\n\r\nPurpose of the loan:  To increase the women\u2019s income, improve the living conditions of the villagers with the purpose of contributing to the reconstruction of the village, and to be able to obtain the means to sell our products throughout the country of Senegal. <p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  Our group has always specialized in the production of palm oil.  We purchase palm kernels from those who produce palm wine, process the palm kernels in order to extract the palm oil, and sell the palm oil to other women who come from every horizon, and they in turn export the product in the interior of the country.  Our hope is to produce palm oil and to be able to market it throughout the country.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French : <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Le village de Youtou est un village en reconstruction apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9cu plus de 10 ann\u00e9es sous le feu de la guerre avec le probl\u00e8me en Casamance.\r\nEtant en reconstruction, nous avons besoin d\u2019un soutien financier qui va nous aider \u00e0 bien mener nos activit\u00e9s   pour mieux affront\u00e9e cette nouvelle phase que nous entamons. <p>\r\n\r\n Objectifs du Pr\u00eat : Augmenter le revenu des femmes, am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des villageois dans le but de contribuer \u00e0 la reconstruction du village, pouvoir obtenir les moins de vendre notre produit dans toute l\u2019\u00e9tendu du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. <p>\r\n\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Notre groupement \u00e0 toujours travailler dans  l\u2019extraction de l\u2019huile de palme.\r\nNous achetons aupr\u00e8s des r\u00e9colteurs de vin de palme les r\u00e9gimes de palmiste que nous traitons pour en extraire l\u2019huile que nous vendons \u00e0 d\u2019autres femmes venant de touts les horizons qui \u00e0 leur tour exportent le produit dans l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du pays.\r\nNotre souhait et de produire et pouvoir  vendre dans tout le pays. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This career which he has been practicing for ten years is not sufficient really to completely meet the family needs due to the insufficiency of his working capital. So he requested and got an initial credit of $500 which he has repaid without incident to strengthen his business of selling spares. With his sense of good management, Mr. Gadagodo S. deserves to be supported financially to increase his businesses. Thus, he is requesting a credit of $1,200 to buy spares in Nigeria and to resell them in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9. This project will increase his income allowing him to better take care of his family.\r\n\r\n<p><p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1963 \u00e0 Tabligbo, Monsieur S.

\u201cNovissi-D.\u201d Women\u2019s Association represents an eight-woman solidarity group.  They all run small businesses that bring in a modest income. However, these women and everyone in their village face a serious problem as regards drinking-water, which is desperately lacking locally. The consequences are severe, with continuing elevated rates of diarrhea and related illnesses, as well as infant mortality, in the area. \r\n<p>\r\nFor reasons of health and daily life, these women are requesting a loan of $2,000 to drill a hole for a well. The resulting drinking water will be managed by the Association and sold to the population. This project therefore has not only an economic aspect but more importantly a humanitarian one, which merits support and financing. The conviction of these women, and especially their ability to manage and make their business activities profitable, is evidence that this project will be a fine achievement for the well-being of the entire village and its surrounding area.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from French by Daniel KUEY\/J,V.

Elles ont toutes de petites activit\u00e9s sous la main qui leurs procurent de petit revenu. Cependant, ces femmes et tout le village sont confront\u00e9s au s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes d\u2019eau potable qui manque cruellement dans le milieu. Les cons\u00e9quences sont lourdes avec des maladies diarrh\u00e9iques et la mortalit\u00e9 infantile encore \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans la zone. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nPour les besoins de sant\u00e9 et de vie, ces femmes sollicitent un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 pour construire un forage. L\u2019eau potable sera g\u00e9r\u00e9e par le groupement et vendue \u00e0 la population.

La bonne foi de ces femmes et surtout leur capacit\u00e9 de g\u00e9rer et de rentabiliser leurs activit\u00e9s est une preuve que ce projet sera une belle r\u00e9ussite pour le bien-\u00eatre de tout

Massan A., age 45, who has six children of her own and two other children in her care, lives her life as if she has never had a husband. It is difficult for her to provide daily food for the the table. She lives with all the children crammed into a small hut, and she feels that the men from Togo's Pr\u00e9fecture du Golfe marry for their own pleasure and not to make their wives happy. Polygamy is their main ambition. \r\n<p>\r\nMadame A.'s salvation lies in the mats she weaves as her main occupation, and which provide her with a survival income. Despite all her responsibilities and her meagre income, Madame A. has always shown a certain honesty and good management with other people's money in the full repayment of her first two loans.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, due to the quality of these services and an ever-increasing market demand, Madame A. is asking for a loan of $900 to allow her to buy raw materials such as the coloring, high quality threads, and so on, in order to increase her production and therefore her income for the needs of her many children.

Akouvi N., who has very high moral standards, is about fifty years old and lives alone with her four (4) children and her granddaughter. She works selling coal. To get supplies, she travels around the country and brings back her supplies to Aneho, where she resells them. For a while now, coal has been rare and Akouvi wishes to build up a large inventory. This is why she is requesting a credit of $750 to buy and resell wood coal to avoid the upcoming shortage. She is at her 4th credit, which leaves no doubt as to her good faith and her sense of respect for the property of others. Given her mastery of her business and her rigorous management, Akouvi deserves to be supported once again.\r\n\r\n<p><p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nJouissant d\u2019une bonne moralit\u00e9, Madame N.

Abra N., an orphan, is married with no children but has charge of three children from her sister, who died two years ago.  Her long-unemployed husband has not really managed to provide for his family.  And so Mrs. N. feels that the entire weight of her family rests on her shoulders.  But because she has a business selling grain, she is doing the best she can to ensure that the basic needs of her family are met.  With a high school education, she figured out how to develop her business.  And she manages it rigorously ever since obtaining two micro-credit loans, which she has paid off without difficulty.  This demonstrates her honesty and dependability.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMrs. N. is reqeusting a $900 loan to lease a larger store for holding major stocks of grain.

Born in Togoville in 1960, Mr. Fran\u00e7ois N. lost his parents very early in life, which forced him to drop out of school to become a boatman on a dugout canoe.

As a boatman, he transports both people and goods from village to village along the river.  This work could help him make a good living if he owned a good canoe.  Having a dependable canoe is very important in this job because a minor mistake or problem could claim dozens of lives. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nHe is therefore requesting a loan of $850 to buy a new canoe for renting out and for transporting goods and people.

N\u2019\u00e9tant pas propri\u00e9taire de la moto, il n\u2019en tire pas r\u00e9ellement profit des fruits de son labeur.

He has many regular clients, including people from surrounding villages who want their goods brought to the market for sale. Several local businesses also subcontract to him when they need extra transportation. Unfortunately a car accident has caused some problems for Vasile\u2019s business recently, though thankfully no one was seriously injured. His car sustained damage and needed numerous repairs. Already some things have been fixed, including most of the body damage, but the vehicle still needs other repairs and part replacements to run well and allow Vasile to continue with his business. For this and also to be prepared to meet the expenses of scheduled maintenance in the near future he is requesting a loan.

Prices have been increasing recently to as much as 60Lei ($4.5), but in Pirlita, a village only ten kilometers away one can still get their haircut for 15 lei ($1) from Taitiana P..  Tatiana has been working as a stylist since she was 18 years old.  She used to work at a hair salon but decided that she wanted to start her own business.  She cuts hair in a room adjacent to her house with a separate entrance.  This room is clean and professional though bare because there is a lack of furniture and the lighting is not the best.  Tatiana would like a loan to buy equipment and instruments, additional tables and lighting for her salon. She believes that she will still be able to still charge 15Lei for a haircut and that business will be especially busy soon for the holiday season.
