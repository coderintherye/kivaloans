She has been selling tubers of yam, cereals like gari, and beans for four years now to support her family. She treks to farming communities to buy her stock from the farmers. This saves her from intermediaries who buy from the farmers and resell to her at higher prices. She also deals in the sale of scrap materials; she collects them in pieces and sells them to companies for further processing. She wants to use the loan to buy yarn, beans, and gari in bulk to meet the daily demands of her customers as they approach the Christmas holiday.

De esta manera Antonio, elabora un embutido artesanal, llamado \u201cButifarra\u201d t\u00edpico de Soledad \u2013Atl\u00e1ntico, donde la proliferaci\u00f3n de estas unidades artesanales ha ido disminuyendo, pues actualmente  ha sido copiado y forma parte de la l\u00ednea de producto de grandes empresas carnicas que son su m\u00e1xima competencia; aunque como lo expresa Antonio, a esas industrias no le queda este producto con el exquisito sabor coste\u00f1o y por eso su clientela sabe lo que come, lo prefieren y lo buscan en el municipio de Soledad, el cual se ha hecho famoso por este producto inspirador de t\u00edpicas y hermosas canciones compuestas por artistas de nuestra Regi\u00f3n Atlanticense e incluidas en \u00e1lbumes  \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d.\n\nAntonio, lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla, procedente de Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar su tierra natal, donde se dedicaba a labores del campo, pero su deseo de encontrar un mejor futuro hizo que se trasladara a la Capital del Atl\u00e1ntico; fue as\u00ed como trabaj\u00f3 en la venta de cocadas inicialmente y luego en una microempresa ubicada en el Municipio de soledad, dedicada a lo que hoy es su \u00fanico ingreso familiar \u201cla fabricaci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de butifarreras\u201d, actividad con la que ha logrado darle educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus esposa.

Desde ese momento el popular Antonio, ha recibido 14 cr\u00e9ditos, gradualmente aumentados en la medida de expansi\u00f3n de su mercado; su capacidad de trabajo y deseo de superaci\u00f3n permitieron que  en el a\u00f1o 1995 comprara un lote, para construir lo que hoy es su vivienda, la cual ha ido levantando poco a poco, con el producto de su trabajo en la fabricaci\u00f3n de la exquisita y muy Caribe butifarra. \n\nAntonio, es un experto en captar la atenci\u00f3n de clientes en espacios de gran afluencia p\u00fablica, con su hija vende al detalle en sitios muy estrat\u00e9gicos y es bien conocido como una persona responsable y honesta.

He ties the casings with string to form links.  He prepares it for cooking and later enjoying.  This is how Antonio prepares a delicious sausage called \u201cButifarra,\u201d typical in Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, where these small operations are going away and their culinary arts have been copied by large meat processing plants, which give great completion.  Antonio says that these companies\u2019 products are not as tasty, so his customers seek him out in Soledad and he has become famous for his product, which has lead to lovely inspirational songs by artisans form the Atlanticense region.  These songs have been included in the album \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d (Jewels of Columbian Music).\r\n\r\nAntonia arrived in Barranquilla from his native land in Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar where has worked in the fields, but his desire for a better life inspired him to move to Atl\u00e1ntico where he initially sold \u201ccocadas,\u201d (sweetened meat candy).  He later worked in a small factory in Soledad, which make butifarra.  This allowed him and his wife to provide for his three children\u2019s educations.  Although he did not receive a formal education, he learned to work and write so that he could educate his children because he believes that a good education will give them a better future.  He has been selling butifarra for 19 years.  His youngest daughter studies in el Sena and also sells his product.  He got his first loan for $30 through \u201cla Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo\u201d (The Santo Domingo Foundation) 17 years ago when he and four friends formed the group \u201cLuz de Luz\u201d (Light from Light).  Since then Antonio has received fourteen incrementally larger loans to expand his market.  His ability to work and desire to get ahead allowed him to buy a vacant lot in 1995. Little by little he built his home with the income he made from the sale of his delicious product.\r\n\r\nAntonio is an expert in attracting customers in wealthy areas.  He and his daughter sell in strategic locations and he is well known for being honest and responsible.  He will use the money from his next loan of $1,300 for supplies, especially beef, pork and chicken in order to offer greater variety and be able to sell in larger quantities and support his neighbors who also sell his product during the high season.  His next challenge is to continue improving his home, particularly the floors, bathroom and painting.  He says that his family\u2019s support in managing his business is important to seeing this through.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

They share their experiences with us.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Mar\u00eda Alicia C. has been active member of this Communal Bank for the past four loan cycles.  She lives in the area called El Carmen de Guzha, which is about 15 minutes away from the city of Cuenca, with her children ranging in age from 2 to 13 years.  Her oldest child is not in school and preferred to pursue a job working at a brass works shop.  The other school-age children attend classes at Aurelio Ochoa Elementary, while the baby is enrolled in day care.  As a result of her work, Mar\u00eda Alicia has managed to build her own home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe joined the Communal Bank upon the recommendation of a friend who told her about how it easy it was to obtain loans and make repayments.  Mar\u00eda Alicia has been selling fruit for fifteen years.  She does not have an established place for selling her goods, so she travels through the market offering her products every day without resting.  Mar\u00eda Alicia tells us that the loans have helped her increase her business and will use this new loan to buy more fruits such as papaya, watermelon, honeydews, bananas, apples, mangos, and other products to increase her assortment of stock to offer her to her customers, thereby generating more business.

She continues the family tradition by selling produce on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  She is devoted to farming during the rest of the week.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, Margarita will buy tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots, and other vegetables.

For about a year he has worked manufacturing refrigerators and ice chests, among other appliances. He has a large client base because he is known for the well-finished products that he makes.  He likes his job because he is accustomed to hard work and because he earns good income, which is enough to support his three children who are his reason for living.

These appealing designs make the garments more valuable at the market.  She is happy with her work because it gives her the freedom in her schedule to also cook and do housework.  Yajayra gets paid for each finished garment, so she tries to produce as many pieces in the shortest time possible in order to earn more money.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Yajayra promises to be very responsible and punctual with her payments because she knows this is the only way for her to get ahead.  She plans to use the money to purchase materials so that she can continue the embroidery work she enjoys.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":455048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase materials for improving her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-22T21:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yajayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124341,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960083,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992927,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717713,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751393,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":166.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933856,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T00:01:37Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164510,"name":"Hazel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Hazel G.

For the last two years she has run an eatery and a grocery store in her house.  This is very comfortable for her because she can care for her three children while working.  Her daily routine starts at 7am when she opens her store with her young assistant.  Later, she starts to prepare the meals she will serve in her eatery.  This way, she can tend to both businesses at the same time. In the early evening, the eatery becomes a chicken shop (a place where she sells grilled chicken).

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lumanai has many years of experience in this business.  Lumanai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lumanai joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lumanai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lumanai M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

H., 45, is married and lives with her four school-aged children and husband in Siem Reap Town, Cambodia.

Her husband is a driver for a private company in the town, earning an income of US$8 per day to help cover the family expenses. H. and her family members are seeking to improve their standard of living and generate a better income. Therefore, H. is asking for a loan of US$1,000 to purchase a motorbike to transport her fish and vegetables for sale in her village. She thinks that this expected loan will enable her to cut back on public transportation expenses and save more money. In the future, she hopes she will be able to make bigger improvements in her business.

C. is 32 and married with 4 children (ages 2 - 11).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Loisi has many years of experience in this business.  Loisi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Loisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Loisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\"The following social metrics for Loisi C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S., 32, is married and lives with her three school-aged children and husband in Siem Reap Town, Cambodia.

They have operated this business since 2000 and are able to earn an income of US $7 per day. S. and her family members are seeking to improve their standard of living and generate a better income. Therefore, S. is asking for a loan of US $800 to purchase a machine to help her in the craft. By doing so, she hopes that she will be able to produce more drums for her existing customers and generate more income.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Samalaulu has 6 years of experience in this business.  Samalaulu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Samalaulu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Samalaulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Samalaulu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Iulai has 10 years of experience in this business.  Iulai needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Iulai joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Iulai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Iulai T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 29 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, selling ice cakes.  Mafoe has 3 years of experience in this business.  Mafoe needs a loan of WST $1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 tala or US $146 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nMafoe joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mafoe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mafoe S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture raising cattle.  Naomi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 tala or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Naomi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Naomi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Liutofaga  has many years of experience in this business.  Liutofaga  needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liutofaga  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Liutofaga 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Liutofaga  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L., 36, is married and lives with his three-year-old child and wife in Phnom Penh City, Cambodia. He is a police officer for a local market in the city, and he is also a skillful blacksmith. He has engaged those jobs since 2003 and is able to earn an income of US $8 per day to help cover the family expenses. His wife stays at home as a housewife to look after his young children and the family. L. and his family members are seeking to improve their standard of living and generate a better income.

SPBD's loans are Vitolina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolina F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ofu has many years of experience in this business.  Ofu needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ofu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ofu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ofu V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives together with her husband and their two daughters, both of whom help her run the business, and two grandchildren. She sells ceramic jugs, grills and other ceramic and clay products, very typical in the Salvadoran culture. Eufemia enjoys a good client base and she sells to different regions of the country on a wholesale basis. She is requesting a loan to purchase more materials for her business, such as clay, ceramic and wood for firing. She hopes to improve the working capital to purchase more material.

F. is 41 years old and lives in Arce City, La Libertad with her husband and two of their grandchildren, whom they care for. Isabel owns a tortilla stand and a shop that sells products like propane gas, grain and candy. Isabel will use her loan to buy corn for making tortillas. There's a factory near her house, and the workers like to stop by for tortillas. She also wants to stock her shop with canned drinks, sodas, bread, and anything else that might help her increase her sales. She hopes this loan will help her provide for her grandchildren, and allow her to help her husband with their other household expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy,

She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Ene has 4 years of experience in this business.  Ene needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Ene joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Ene L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She sells cosmetics and perfumes as a street vendor, going from house to house offering her products. She buys her merchandise on a retail basis. She is asking for a loan to be able to buy more inventory since often her customers ask her for a particular item and she can't get it since she doesn't have enough capital. She is also asking for a loan because given the nature of her job and her customer base, many customers need to make their purchases using credit, something she doesn't have the funds to offer.

ription":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faalolo A. is 52 and married with 2 children (ages 29 and 37).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faalolo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Faalolo needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Faalolo joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faalolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faalolo A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 35 and married with 2 children (ages 8-months and 8).  She works in her 's business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Fiavaai has 4 years of experience in this business.  Fiavaai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fiavaai joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fiavaai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiavaai E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 42 and married with 5 children (ages 2-months - 16).  She works in her 's business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Karoline has 4 years of experience in this business.  Karoline needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Karoline joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Karoline's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Karoline etelo are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

D., 58, is not a computer techie but she knows how to run a computer rental station.  Married to Ferdinand D. and blessed with three children, she makes it a point to balance her role as a mother, a wife and a businesswoman. \r\n\r\nOfelia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was that she used almost all the money she borrowed to invest in her computer rental business. With the help of her business, she and her husband now earn PHP 70,000 net income per month. They also have two employees working for them.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used mostly as a source of added capital for her expanding business. She will buy upgraded computer accessories to provide additional services for her clients. The extra profit that she will receive from this loan will be used for her children\u2019s school expenses and to improve the quality of her family's life.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her computer rental business will continue to grow and that life will be more blessed through the years. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

S. is 59 and married with 7 children (ages 9 - 25).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ape has 1 year of experience in this business.  Ape needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ape rejoined the SPBD program so that she can financially support her business in regards of her request for a small loan. This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ape's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

is 56 and married with 6 children (ages 9-20).  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Eseta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Eseta's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

D., 41, is striving hard so that she can have her sandal making business be at the same level as it was before.  Her business was badly affected when Typhoon Ketsana struck Metro Manila last September living their home flooded with water.   Married to Angelito D., they are blessed with four children. Together, she and her husband strive hard to manage their business so that their family can have a better life.  They have been selling sandals and slippers for eight years now.\r\n\r\nEmily has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she has been consistent in paying her dues is because she has used almost all the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for their sandal making business.  Their business now lets them earn a profit of PHP 5,200 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital by buying the raw materials needed for the expansion of their business.\r\n\r\nEmily hopes that the extra profit that they will gain will let them save money so that they can finance their children's college education someday. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She has been breeding and selling pigs for ten years.<p>\r\nRosalinda has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow six times from CCT\u2019s cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed to buy feed for her pigs. Her business lets her earn a profit of 30,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) per month.<p>\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of 18,000 PHP. She will use this amount as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more feed for her increasing number of pigs.<p>\r\nShe dreams that she and her husband can save enough money so that her children will finish their studies and find their own career paths. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He and his family live in Khujand, Tajikistan. Islomdjon started his own small venture after his relatives suggested he should try his luck as a market vendor. Today Islomdjon runs a small business selling women\u2019s clothing. His vending facility has a very favorable location and offers a large assortment of merchandise, which attracts many customers. Islomdjon believes that financial support from IMON International has helped him boost his sales and grow his business. He would like a loan of 6800 Somoni to purchase inventory wholesale. Islomdjon believes this loan will help him further develop his business and get additional income to improve his family\u2019s living standards.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They live in the South Pelengana area of the city of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey know each other through marriage, community, and professional relations.\r\nThis group of women runs businesses selling various items (cosmetics, pagnes - a type of brightly-printed West African cloth, incense, embroidered fabric, plastic footwear, etc.)\r\nIt is with the hope of satisfying their clientele that they decided to join the loan program of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners), with whom they are on their 3rd solidarity (group) loan, after having repaid their two previous loans.\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy 3 sets of pagnes wax, 5 sets of embroidered clothing, 60 boxes of creams and ointments for skin and hair, 25 kg of \"gueni\" (a fragrant root), 3 bottles of eau de Cologne, 10 bottles of perfume, and 24 empty bottles in which to put incense for sale.\r\nThey get their supplies of embroidered clothing in Burkina Faso,their pagnes wax and ingredients to prepare incense at the grand market in S\u00e9gou, and buy their creams and ointments in Bamako.\r\nTo make their incense, they lightly grind the \"gueni\", then hand-pick and submerge it in eau de Cologne in a vase that they seal hermetically for a month, after which time they add a sufficient quantity of perfume and mix it well before putting it in boxes for sale.\r\nThe clothes are re-sold in Dioro, Markala, and the city of S\u00e9gou, while the creams, ointments, and incense are re-sold at home or door-to-door in the area.\r\nThe sales are generally made in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\nThey hope to realize an average monthly profit of 21,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan from Soro Yiriwaso, provide for social and family occasions (marriages, baptisms, circumcisions, and funerals), increase savings, and take care of certain family expenses.\r\nTheir ambition is to own individual businesses and become wholesalers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

On average, these women are 41 years of age and have six children. They live in the South Pelengana district of Segou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They came to know each other through neighborhood and family connections, and a traditional association of neighborhood women. This groups sells diverse products and makes traditional soaps. The women have decided to work with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution to better satisfy the needs of their growing clientele. This is their third group loan. The previous two were repaid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy 24 pairs of shoes, two 200-liter barrels of cooking oil, 2 barrels of refined oil residue, 25 kg of caustic soda, 30 packets of Omo, and 50 kg of resin. They get their supply of shoes at Cotonou, oil, caustic soda, Omo and starch (product derived from cassava that is used to make white garments smooth and shiny) at the Segou grand market, and oil residue from the Ba Mariama of Pelengan oil plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe native soap is made by cooking the oil residue for a long time, then adding caustic soda, a sufficient quantity of resin and the Omo. The mixture is blended until it is homogenous. This paste is cooled and shaped into balls while wearing gloves. These soap balls are then sold near home by walking through the neighborhood and in retail stores. The sales are done in cash and on credit to male and female customers. An average monthly revenue of 30 000 CFA francs is expected, which will be used to pay off the loan, buy school supplies and pay for certain family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":455758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase diverse products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami        W.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

up of four married women who are in monogamous marriages.  They average 41 years of age, five children and live in the Pelengana South neighbourhood of the city of Segou (Fourth admnistrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey know one another through being neighbours and by marriage.\r\n\r\nThis group of women sells a variety of goods and decided to join the loan programme of Soro Yiriwaso in order to satisfy customer demand, which is growing markedly.  This is their third group loan, having repaid their two previous loans in full.\r\n\r\nThis third loan will be used to buy two 30-metre rolls of bazin cloth, 10 pant and shirt outfits, 10 short and shirt outfits, 10 skirt and t-shirt outfits, 6 dresses, 24 bottles of perfume, a dozen lipsticks, 2 packages of earrings and 2 dozen wallets.\r\n\r\nThey buy the white bazin cloth from the main market and then dye it.  The children's clothing and wallets are also purchased at the main market of Segou.  The perfume, lipsticks and earrings are bought in Burkina Faso.\r\n\r\nThey generally sell their goods at the Ch\u00e2teau market in Segou, from home or on foot in their neighbourhood.  They sell for cash and on credit to both men and women.\r\n\r\nThey hope to make 32,750 CFA monthly with which they will repay the loan from Soro Yiriwaso and contribute to some of their household expenses as well as for a number of social events (marriages, baptisms, circumcisions and funerals).\r\n\r\nTheir goal is to be able to apply for greater loans in the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":455766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a variety of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah           S\u00e9tou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152486,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991326,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021601,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746391,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778931,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51762.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T22:47:01Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164817,"name":"Saliou Mbacke","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Saliou Mbacke S. is a \"commercant\" (a trader or vendor) in the main market of Bambey, which is a rural town about 100 kilometers from Dakar.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Munavvar is 43-year old loving mother of three children. For more than 17 years, Munavvar has sold fish in the central fish market of the city. \r\n\r\nWhen she started she had only $100 United States dollars (USD) in turnover. With time, her business expanded and today it is a quite stable business. Munavvar has requested a loan in the amount of $1,500 USD. She wants to purchase a quantity of fish at wholesale prices in order to have stock to sell during the New Year's celebration when fishing is prohibited. Munavvar has shown herself to be a reliable client and has been already provided with the loan by IMON. She would like to thank everyone for their support.  \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a regular income.  Ram\u00f3n now has a stall where he sells purses and wallets for women.  He sells wholesale and retail.  According to him, he gets greater income from this new field.

Judith M. is 28 years old and married. She and her husband have two daughters aged eight years and six months old. Judith owns a barber shop in the Tegeta community of Dar es Salaam and a beauty salon in Temeke, Dar es Salaam. She opened both of these businesses in 2005 after working for many years as a server at Steers, a local fast food restaurant. She says it was one of her proudest moments to finally be able to open her own business after saving for so long.\r\n\r\nJudith received her first loan from Tujijenge in 2008. Since then she has taken four loans and has been able to hire two employees at the barber shop and two more at the salon. She splits her time between the two locations, bringing her six-month-old daughter to work with her and caring for her while carrying out her work duties.\r\n\r\nWhile she was pregnant, Judith was worried about taking loans from Tujijenge because she was not able to work as much. Therefore, she did not receive a loan for the past two loan cycles. Now that she has given birth and is back to a regular work schedule, she is happy and excited to take another loan.\r\n\r\nJudith hopes to use this loan to invest in more supplies for her barber shop and salon. She will purchase items such as hair tongs, scissors, combs, brushes, hair weave (hair extensions) and other hair products. She says she hopes to use any extra profits to pay her children's school fees and medical bills. Right now, Judith makes a profit of about 615 US Dollars per month. Her businesses are especially busy on Saturdays and Sundays, or when her customers need their hair done for weddings.\r\n\r\nJudith will share this loan with the members of her group, Igembe.

She is 23 years old, unmarried, and has no children.\r\n\r\nBahati has owned and operated her own video library in the Mbezi area of Dar es Salaam for two years with no one assisting her. The video shop, where she rents and sells music and movies, is open from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m. daily. She has a mix of Tanzanian, Indian, and American films.

For 13 years she has been doing two activities that are essential for the livelihood of her home. First she began to manufacture artisinal guitars. She also offers the service of shows on the weekend in which she is the lead singer. She delights her audience with her melodious voice singing various songs. She has to work all week since she builds guitars with her husband, and weekends she sings with her musical equipment. She is also accompanied by a musical group whose members are her partners and they share the earnings after finishing the shows. Edelvina's dream is to have a factory with modern tools to produce her musical instruments in less time and more quality, in addition to having a consoldidated musical group. This is the sixth loan opportunity she has had with MFP. For the entire time she has been with the communal bank she has been very punctual with her payments. She will invest the money in the purchase of materials to build her guitars, such as varnish, wood, strings, among others.

La socia y sus compa\u00f1eras de negocio solo preparan este pan \u201cChuta navide\u00f1a\u201d para las fiestas de navidad. La socia requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mas insumos como harina, az\u00facar, manteca, frutas y pasas para preparar las \u201cchutas navide\u00f1as\u201d para esta navidad ya que por estas \u00e9pocas es donde se vende m\u00e1s. \n\nLa socia se encuentra agradecida por la oportunidad brindada mediante este medio y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir con el pago correspondiente al cronograma.\n","en":"Jaquelinne is 26 years old and is seven months pregnant. She has two children, Sandro, 7, and Anne, 4. Jaquelinne is a native of the city of Urcos, province of Quispicanchis, and department of Cusco. She belongs to the \u201cQori Orcco\u201d communal bank of the Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa. Urcos is 45 km. from the city of Cusco, about a 45-minute journey.\r\n<p>\r\nJaquelinne gets up very early to do her housework, such as making breakfast for her children and sending them off to school. After doing her household chores, she goes to sell bread in the Plaza de Armas of the city of Urcos. She says that from a young age, she helped her mother make and sell bread. She learned the lessons of her mother and now has her own business. \r\n<p>\r\nTwo years ago, Jaquelinne and her work partners had the idea to create a special bread that they called \u201cChuta Navide\u00f1a\u201d [Christmas Chuta]. It has the same characteristics as normal chuta bread (a large, soft, round bread with particular smell that is traditional in Urcos) with the addition of raisins and fruit. They only prepare this bread for the Christmas holidays. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is needed to purchase the ingredients for this season\u2019s \u201cChutas Navide\u00f1as,\u201d such as flour, sugar, butter, fruits, and raisins. Jaquelinne is grateful for this opportunity, and commits to making her payments on schedule.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":455976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Buy flour, sugar, butter fruit, and raisins for \u201cchutas navide\u00f1as\u201d.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-23T17:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaquelinne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":226.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":235.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":244.6},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":254.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":264.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":275.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":226.15,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":227.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034424,"comment":null},{"amount":82.32,"local_amount":235.19,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":237.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872520,"comment":null},{"amount":85.61,"local_amount":244.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":246.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905778,"comment":null},{"amount":89.04,"local_amount":254.4,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":256.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633252,"comment":null},{"amount":92.59,"local_amount":264.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":266.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667716,"comment":null},{"amount":96.29,"local_amount":275.05,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":277.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851458,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T18:53:54Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":164916,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth D., 34 years old, is a mother of two children.
