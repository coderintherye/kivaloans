She makes food for the teachers on credit.  What is hard is that sometimes she is paid a month later yet she has to invest.  What makes her feel better is sure money.  Mrs. Maritza\u2019s goal is to be able to offer her customers a lot of variety and be able to compete with the competition since there are other kiosks in the high school.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":477248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To buy: sodas, sweets, bread, baked goods, meat, milk products, vegetables and fruits to prepare food, hair clips,earrings, sodas, locks, to increase sales ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-26T01:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.19,"local_amount":1214.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1216.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841642,"comment":null},{"amount":58.05,"local_amount":1211.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874595,"comment":null},{"amount":56.34,"local_amount":1175.77,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1177.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604459,"comment":null},{"amount":58.16,"local_amount":1213.79,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639928,"comment":null},{"amount":58.72,"local_amount":1225.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821713,"comment":null},{"amount":55.54,"local_amount":1159.72,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1161.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561721,"comment":null},{"amount":58.42,"local_amount":1219.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1221.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770646,"comment":null},{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":1184.77,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204538,"comment":null},{"amount":57.58,"local_amount":1201.61,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1203.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330248,"comment":null},{"amount":57.23,"local_amount":1194.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T03:09:43Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171481,"name":"V\u00edctor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"V\u00edctor B.

As the father of a family, he wants the best for his son. He has worked as the driver of a truck for the last two years, during which he has been able to make improvements to his home. When he started this job he drove a truck for hauling and was paid by commission, but now his wages are fixed. Even though he doesn\u2019t make much, it is enough for food, basic bills, and other expenses. With this loan he wants to able to properly close off his bathroom and latrine, which he has covered with pieces of tin and a curtain. This is uncomfortable, unsafe and not very hygienic, but he can\u2019t afford to put up concrete walls all at once. With the loans given to him by Afodenic he is making the improvements bit by bit. It is a great joy for him to be able to make the improvements which are a daily necessity for his family\u2019s hygiene.

Her husband works as a security guard.  Her business is the sale of dairy products, such as cheese, cream, buttermilk and cooked beans. She buys the cheese 100lbs at a time, which results a lot cheaper, and sell it by the pound and delivers it to the general stores.  She has been in sales for 12 years, previously she sold only tortillas and cooked beans, but as the need to increase her sales and income grew she decided to also sell cheese.  Thanks to the loans from Afondenic, she has been able to increase her inventory.  She feels happy to be able to help her husband, whose salary is low,  with the expenses.  With the money from this loan she will buy: cheese, corn and firewood so that she can continue to making handmade tortillas to offer to her customers.  Also at this time she does not have any cheese, which she sells daily in the mornings.

She has a small store where she sells pastries and tamales, along with other foods.  She says her products are well-received in her community because they are very good and of high quality.  She also says that she is very happy to be able to have her own business and that, thanks to this project, her living conditions and her family's conditions have gotten considerably better, and she says as well that she has grown as a person and has learned a lot.\r\n\r\nCristina is now asking for a microloan of \u00a2656,000 (six hundred fifty-six thousand colones), to expand her store and buy different materials that are necessary for making her products.  With this loan she hopes to increase her production in order to attract more customers, offer better service and make her business grow more and become a successful microbusiness.\r\n\r\nCristina is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal San Crist\u00f3bal Norte (SACRIN), one of EDESA's 100 member organizations in Costa Rica. She has received 5 microloans and has paid them responsibly.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Tab L., 54, lives in a big wooden house with other family members. Her house is along a river that has been affected by flooding. To earn a living, Tab L. and her husband always wake up in early morning to prepare and then go to the middle of the river in their own boat to fish.

A. is from the village of Mahinog, Camiguin Province. She is 57 years old. Luz is single. To make a living, Luz owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products like beverages in the local community. Luz has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Luz is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Luz from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Their ages range from 30 to 55 years and each woman has between 1 and 3 children. Their children's education ranges from primary school through high school. The Sari Usaha Group is located in the Nusasari Village about 5 kilometers from Melaya Village. The group is chaired by Ni Ketut Pertami. The group is getting a loan to expand their businesses in pig breeding. This loan will be used to buy pig food, repair cages or to buy piglets.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group representatives who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.  As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.  This collection of 10 women is a subset of a larger 60-woman community loan that is being offered by MUK.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please copy and paste this URL into a new browser window: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":477458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"used to buy pig food, repair cages or to buy piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T02:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Gusti Ketut Sri Astiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Pertami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A A Ayu Lipurniti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Ariyani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Mertiasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Westri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Eni Wirastiasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman Dertiasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh Sulastri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Sumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":13000000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":13000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1400,"local_amount":13000000,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":13076000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159663970,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T09:54:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:31:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171544,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther E. is from the village of Kinangay Norte in Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have a child who grows each day, along with their financial needs. \r\nShe began, some time ago, selling different products. She even had a home-made food shop which she had to close because of the increase in the shop\u2019s rent, and because the owners were asking for the shop. So, one of her friends convinced her to sell clothes and offered to take her to places where she could buy clothes at good prices. She followed her friend\u2019s advice and began to sell clothes 6 years ago. Her sales went very well after she started. She now has a fair number of clients. Mavluda asks for 4000 Somoni to purchase seasonal garments. She wants to take advantage of the dates and to have a more diverse variety of garments for her clients, which will allow her to increase her sales.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

F., 24, lives in San Vicente department with her sister, brother-in-law, and their children, because her parents emigrated to the United States.  Despite this, Mirna decided to forge ahead and set up her own business.  She sells clothing for men and women in a store that is located in downtown San Vicente, an area that has a lot of foot traffic and, because it is on the town's main street, sales are very good, escpecially on weekends.  \r\n\r\nThis is how Mirna earns her livelihood, working hard to improve her business' condition and increasing her stock.  This is the reason why Mirna is requesting funding; she wants to buy a greater variety of colors and sizes of fashionable clothing so that her sales will increase and she will have better economic stability.  She wants to continue to make progress, to be self-sufficient; she is always striving to improve and to set new goals for herself.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

Ella es una persona muy trabajador quien cuenta con muy buenas referencias por parte de sus vecinos, y quien siempre est\u00e1 buscando nuevas formas de mejorar sus ventas, ya que es consciente que solo de esta manera podr\u00e1 mejorar su estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"32-year old Linda Margaret R. L. lives in the municipality of Col\u00f3n which is located in La Libertad department. She lives with her sister and nephew. Linda owns a store where she sells perishable products and basic necessities. She has tried to better stock her store as time has passed, but it has been impossible since the majority of her income goes towards household expenses.  Her sister who is a single mother also contributes. \r\n\r\nLinda is asking for a loan to buy a bigger quantity of products such as rice, beans, sugar, and cold drinks. These items sell well in this location, and she wants to take advantage of that to increase her income. She is hardworking and gets good references from her neighbours. She is always looking for ways to boost her sales as she knows that this is the only way she will be able to improve her financial situation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg,

Their ages range between 25 and 50 years. They have two to four children each. Their children's education levels range between elementary school through high school. One woman has been able to finance her child's university education. \r\n\r\nThis group proposed a loan of Rp. 11,000,000 and each member will receive Rp. 1,000,000. This loan will be used to buy piglets and pig food. The group is chaired by Ni Kade Citra Dewi. They hold monthly meetings to share information about their businesses, to collect savings and as a social gathering.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as village banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group representatives who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.  As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers. This collection of 11 women is a subset of a larger 60-woman community loan that is being offered by MUK.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about village banking on Wikipedia, please copy and paste this URL into a new browser window: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":477539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Used to buy piglets and pig food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Kade Citra Dewi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Sudiani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wiartini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh Putu Arini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Sujani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh Budiasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Parwati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suryani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Tri Nioni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Setiawati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suwetri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":11000000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":11000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":11000000,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11208000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159663971,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T00:28:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:31:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171579,"name":"Rahany","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Rahany H. sells charcoal and bread in the market.

Her business is very profitable because, as she says, there is no competition in the area. She runs the business out of her home, where her customers come to buy the tortillas on a daily basis. Tortillas are eaten everyday, and up to twice daily with meals. \r\n\r\nGloria is asking for a loan to buy corn wholesale and take advantage of cheaper prices by buying at this time of year. It is very important to her to be able to sell more tortillas as her children are growing and will need extra things. As well, the cost of their education will get more expensive. In spite of these problems Gloria wants to be able to provide all the necessities of life for her family, so she wants to further invest in her business and increase her income.<br

","en":"Roucayatou Ab\u00e9bi I. was born October 9, 1963 in Calavi in Benin. She settled about 20 years ago in the Hlacomey area of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Married to Akangb\u00e9 OSSENI, Roucayatou Ab\u00e9bi is mother of four children, all in school. She lives together with her husband and children in Hlacomey. Roucayatou Ab\u00e9bi helps her husband with the household expenses, thanks to the income generated by her activity. She has not attended school.\r\n\r\nTo meet her needs over the past 15 years, Roucayatou Ab\u00e9bi has sold men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing through the distribution system. She gets her supplies from Togo and Nigeria, two neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nRoucayatou Ab\u00e9bi is a former beneficiary of ALID\u00e9, having already been granted three loans that she reimbursed in full. Her ambition is to increase her stock of supplies, to better satisfy her customers. However, she has been unable to gather the necessary funds to do so. For this reason she is now requesting a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

She lives there with her family, which is made up of her husband and two children, 9 and 4 years old, who are enrolled in the local elementary school.  Carlota requests funds hoping to help her business grow.  She will buy items like:  bread, eggs, basic grains, larger amounts of soft-drinks (which are her best sellers).  A grocery store is a very profitable business and she always makes good profits, as long as she is well stocked.  She hopes, therefore, to be able to buy all the necessary merchandise that will allow her to increase her sales.  Carlota has always dreamt of providing for her children a better life than the one she had; sufficient reason to work very hard every day to improve her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJulie is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Julie operates a store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Julie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the first loan taken out by Julie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

After four months of fattening her pig, she can sell it either alive or slaughter it and sell its pork per kilo in the neighborhood. The profit with this is not much but is fair enough.

A. is from the village of Hinaplanon, Iligan City.

While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Jordiana has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jordiana joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jordiana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. Jordiana is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jordiana from HSPFI. She plans to reinvest the additional revenue generated from the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie L. is from the village of Mozzozzin Norte, Sta. Maria, Isabela. She is 43 years old. Rosalie is the leader of a 15-member loan group offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalie owns and operates a business venture raising livestock. While this is not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Rosalie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. Rosalie is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock, feed, and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rosalie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Edna has a small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store in their village that sells the most common commodities to help her husband earn money to save for her weekly repayment to ASHI. Last year, Edna and her husband both agreed to buy a tricycle of their own so that her husband would no longer have to rent from other people. With that, income will increase, and they will have their own productive asset. Since Edna paid up her previous loan from ASHI early this year, she is requesting a much larger loan to materialize the business plan she and her husband agreed on. Through the profits they will make, Edna envisions that someday all of her five children, whose ages range from 11 to 23, including her month-old grandchild will graduate from college and have a better career. For herself, she wishes that she will be able to have money through her profits to spend on her dream of having false

Sary M. is 54 years old and she lives in Kbal Kaoh village in Kandal province. She and her husband, Mr. Ros Sim, are farmers who own a 2-hectare field to cultivate both rice and vegetables. For rice farming, they own a water machine to support their crop field. They face some problems because their field contains infertile soil and has a lot of insects. Thus, Mrs. Sary M. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides, and she would use the rest of the loan to buy gasoline to pump water to support the field.

M. is 38 years old, single and was ill for 24 years of her life. Just recently, she had the courage to undergo an operation to remove a cyst from her ovary. One of the reasons why she had to endure the ailment she had for so long was because she lacked the money to pay for the operation.  Moreover, she felt she had no one encouraging or supporting her morally.\r\n\r\nFilomina lives with her 69-year-old mother and she acts as a provider for herself, mother, and other close family relatives. It was through ASHI, one of Kiva's field partners in the Philippines, that she had savings which she used to spend for her operation. Loans from ASHI have also enabled her to start up and maintain a small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store business. Little by little, Filomina\u2019s business is growing, but it's not growing as fast as she'd hoped because  the living expenses incurred by her family and the cost of her medicine is almost equal to her income.\r\n\r\nFilomina\u2019s health is now in better condition after her operation, and she's gotten good post-operative results from her doctor regarding her condition. She is excited to grow her \u201csari-sari\u201d store. She wishes to increase the inventory of goods in her store for the convenience of people in their village, which is far from the main market.  Moreover, Filomina wishes for a better kind of life for both her mother and herself. Therefore, for her dreams to come true, she is  requesting to borrow a much larger amount from ASHI this time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":477698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

S., 52, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. Married to Armando S., a retired businessman, she makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that they can have a better life. Both of them have been managing their own variety store for a year.\r\n\r\nSalvacion S. has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT), a Kiva partner, for more than four years. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow several times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy added stock for her store. Her business lets her earn a profit of 6,250 Philippine pesos per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by allowing her to buy assorted canned goods, snacks, beverages and toiletries for her store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her store will continue to grow and become a mini grocery someday so that she can help with the schooling of her grandchildren. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":477687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying

A. is undeniably a happy woman.  Being a mother and a wife, she maintains her family\u2019s harmonious relationship. Her husband and her four children are loving and supportive to one another. No matter how busy Merlinda is with her business, she makes sure that she has time to attend to her family's needs, be it at home or in the schools of her children. <P>\r\n\r\nAside from her family, Merlinda\u2019s other inspiration is the opportunity of having been trusted with a loan through ASHI, KIva field partner in the Philippines. Through credit she has accessed since the time she became a member, her dream of having a fishing and fish-selling business has eventually came true. It started off very small and little by little, after each loan, it has grown and has been helping many fishermen in their village. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough Merlinda\u2019s loan she can buy a large volume of fish caught by other fishermen in their village.  Using a motorcycle driven by her husband, she sells the fish in other villages of their remote municipality in the province of Antique. Her customers from the two neighboring municipalities come to their house to buy tons of fish to sell once Merlinda calls them and informs them that she has plenty of fish. This happens about four times a week.<P>\r\n\r\nMerlinda\u2019s motorcycle is being paid for in installments every month. However, Merlinda would like to fully pay her remaining balance to maximize her profit in growing her business. Therefore, she is requesting a larger loan for that purpose; some of it will be used for additional capital since growing a business needs bigger capital. <P>\r\n\r\nDespite being a woman, Merlinda also goes fishing in the sea together with her husband, wanting to achieve her dreams of giving her children and grand-children a better life. She hopes that through her business proceeds she will be able to complete the house she and her husband are building for themselves, and that someday all of their kids will graduate from college and have their own careers and not the hard life she and her husband have had since birth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":477707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She helps her husband meet their family's needs with the income generated from her business. Delphine never attended school. To cover expenses, she sells various products (couscous, milk, eggs, rice, toothpaste, pills) from her home. She also sells liquor from her home, which allows her to increase her source of income.

He has been operating a \"duka,\" or shop, since 2007 where he sells items like oil, soap, sugar, tea, matches and other household items. His duka is open from 6am until 9pm every day. Iddy's shop is named \"Father D Shop\" and is located in the Kunduchi area of Dar es Salaam. This is a very popular area near the beach and Iddy, therefore, often runs out of stock. He buys more stock three times a week. Iddy is able to employ his younger brother at the shop and makes a monthly profit of 300,000 Tanzanian shillings (~$225 USD). \r\n\r\nThis will be Iddy's second loan from Tujijenge Tanzania, Ltd. He repaid the first one successfully. When asked about his future plans for his business Iddy says that he wants his shop to grow very big. He hopes that eventuA. he will make enough profit to buy a \"pikipiki\" (Swahili for \"motorbike\") to help him transport stock. Iddy says, \"I feel very happy about getting this loan because I was down before, but now I'm going up and up a little at a time\".

Murodbeg is 36 years-old. He buys and sells cattle from different market places and has been in the business for the last 10 years. His main customers are butchers and livestock farmers. He is requesting a second loan after successfully repaying a first one. With the previous loan, Murodbeg was able to increase the number of heads that he trades. Murodbeg is married and the father of three children. With the loan from Kiva, he plans to increase his herd of cattle for trading and, if possible, open up his own butchery. This, he says, will increase his turnover. He hopes to see his children complete higher education and to get good jobs unlike himself.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has been saving from her business; this is why her business has grown to this level.  Sarah needs this loan as working capital for her business. She plans to buy more kitchen utensils for resale.  She dreams of educating her entire family.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Sarah is the one holding the sign.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:<P>\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

Garmai and her family live and work in the Bernard Farm community on Kakata Highway, Margibi County, Liberia.  \r\n\r\nGarmai\u2019s business is the sale of general goods such as insecticides, candles, matches, torch lights,  etc. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail from a tabletop in front of her house to residents of Bernard Farm. She has been running this business for more than 18 years and hopes to own a shop in the near future.\r\n\r\nGarmai started selling in neighboring Guinea when she was there as a refugee.

Her highest level of formal education is the completion of 3rd grade.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant that has been working with Erika has described her as a hardworking, honest, sincere, noble woman with a battling spirit. This will be her first loan with Fundacion Mujer. Erika is applying for this loan in an effort to gain financial independence as well as to earn an income to help her sister Karol raise her child, who has special needs.\r\n\r\nErika's determination is exemplified by her daily work routine. She has dedicated the last five years of her life to selling newspapers in the morning while working as a masseuse in the afternoon. Recently, an opportunity to purchase the newspaper stand and license where Erika and her sister work, has presented itself. Erika plans to use this loan to purchase the newspaper vendors license from the Costa Rican government, for 250,000 colons, and also the newsstand itself.\r\n\r\nAs owner, Erika will be able to earn more revenues and better support herself, her immediate family and her sister. The newspaper stand is located diagonally to the Legislative Assembly in a densely populated pedestrian zone of San Jose where many locals have become accustomed to purchasing their daily newspapers.\r\n\r\nErika and her sister sell papers from 6 a.m. to noon everyday or until they run out of papers. In an average good month Erika can earn 290,000 colons selling papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nErika\u2019s goals are to earn enough money from the newsstand to provide a quality standard of living for her family. In the long term she would like to open a beauty salon.\r\n\r\nAlthough she would like to be able to sell more than just newspapers at her stand, this would require the purchase of another expensive license. Erika mentions this as one of the main deterrents to the growth of her business. The good news is that her papers are selling fast, and often she is sold out by 8 in the morning!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":477851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Sierra Leone. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

H., 34, lives in Cayultit\u00e1n in the department of La Paz. He lives together with his wife and his two younger children, who are students. Tomas sells tamales which are filled with chicken meat. This type of meat is very appealing to people in this area, as his business is located in Olocuilta, a place that is very famous for their pupusas (thick tortillas typically stuffed with cheese, meat, and\/or beans) and is visited by many tourists from all over the country as well as foreigners. These tourists allow Tomas to sell great numbers of tamales. He is asking for a loan so he can buy greater quantities of corn to make the dough for the tamales and so he can buy more chickens and vegetables. The loan will allow him to increase the number of tamales he produces and thus take advantage of his client base and increase sales. The tamales are his only source of income with which to support his family. It is for this reason that Tomas must be able to improve the conditions of his business, as his family is completely dependent upon the profits generated by it. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Tomorrow\u201d. This will be the group\u2019s second loan from Fundacion Mujer. The first was for 100,000 colones for each group member, and was paid back on time and in full. The members of this group live in Coto Brus, Puntarenas, a rural community located in the southern region of Costa Rica near the Panamanian border.\r\n\r\nThese women are in the business of animal rearing. They work with cows, pigs and chickens. This loan will be used for the purchase of animals as well as general investments in activities conducive to the healthy upbringing of animal livestock such as food, shelter and nutrients.\r\n\r\nCows, pigs and chickens are raised by the women until they are ready to be sold. Chickens are generally sold in the community, to neighbors, friends and acquaintances, whereas pigs and cows are sold to purchasers who travel to the community from nearby cities. These purchasers can be middlemen\/women who will resell the pigs or cows to butchers for final use. The purchasers may also be the butchers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe group members\u2019 families benefit greatly from their livestock businesses. In general, the women have the goal of rendering the earnings generated through their sales more stable by acquiring more livestock and seeking out new clients. An obstacle for the group has been the unpredictable effects of animals becoming sick. Changes in climate have affected the quality and quantity of grazing land for cows as well as the susceptibility of chickens and pigs to disease.\r\n\r\nJennifer P. A. is the 21-year-old mother of two who lives in Coto Brus. She had her first child when she was sixteen years old. She has a business rearing and selling pigs which she started with an initial investment of 100,000 colons. Jennifer appreciates the importance of providing a quality product to her clients in order to keep them coming back to her instead of choosing another producer. The values she expects her group to display are responsibility, solidarity and honesty.\r\n\r\nMaritza G. P. is a 32 year old woman who lives in Coto Brus with her husband of sixteen years and their four children. She has a business rearing and selling cows. Maritza says she wants her business to grow in order to improve her quality of life and that of her family. She comments that before she was approved for her loan she was afraid; with the loan, she feels secure.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":477970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coto Brus","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T01:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380952.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":419047.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":702.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":772.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":703.19,"local_amount":381388.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":384999.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763266,"comment":null},{"amount":13.47,"local_amount":7305.6,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7374.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850717,"comment":null},{"amount":758.34,"local_amount":411305.42,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":415199.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428430,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T03:05:15Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171793,"name":"Ulda Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ulda Maria tiene 38 a\u00f1os, esta joven tiene 4 hijos de los cuales solamente 2 est\u00e1n a su cargo.

They are all mothers and fathers, and are hard-working and entrepreneurial. They are involved in businesses like tinsmithing, blacksmithing, selling bread, chicken, cheese, food, perfume, appliances, and groceries, as well as providing services like teaching.

She is married, but given her husband's income, they don't have enough to pay for rent, basic services, and education for their children. That is why she delivers newspapers in the morning and sells hamburgers in the afternoon and evening, with the help of her small children.\r\n<p>\r\nThese loans will be used to buy ingredients, materials, and tools to improve their businesses and increase their incomes, so they can improve their homes and give their families a better quality of life. Although this is their first loan cycle, the members of this group already have experience with group loans and know that the group is necessary for them to have access to this economic support and they need to keep the trust of our institution. They have a strong desire to work and to get ahead, and they are united in this group.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

By placing and maintaining ATMs at hotels and other travel businesses in the Washington D.C. area, Don earns part of the convenience fee busy travelers pay.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019s ACCION USA loan will allow him to expand by adding another ATM placement.

Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

All the members of the group are mothers and fathers, so their children are their primary concern, especially their education and future. Many of these members have more than one job to cover the necessities for their children, since they have a lot of obligations. That is why they are requesting this loan to give them working capital so they can buy ingredients, merchandise, materials, and tools to help them improve their finished products and improve their businesses. This way, they will have better incomes that will translate into a better quality of life for their families.\r\n<p>\r\nThe majority of these members sell food, either in a market, in the evenings in their neighborhoods, or on weekends in local fairs. Others are weavers, or sell bread, soda and drinks, or provide public transportation in urban areas. For example, Herminia sells vegetables in the central market, and at night she sells hamburgers in the entrance of her home. She has to support her three children alone, since she is divorced. But she doesn't lack anything; she is able to provide for her children to help them get ahead, since she wants them to become professionals and have a better future. \r\n<p>\r\nCompetition is high in these commercial areas, but these members know how to get ahead. They are entering their second loan cycle, having demonstrated responsibility, honesty, and eagerness to get ahead by working to improve their quality of life and that of their families. \r\n\r\n<br

They all have their own businesses, either in their homes or in the market, like selling empanadas and soft drinks, groceries and cosmetics, and providing services like public transport and manicures. \r\n<p>\r\nFor example, the leader, Elizabeth, is a primary school teacher because she loves children. She is the mother of two children and is married. She strives to work hard, and gives private lessons so that she can earn more income to give her children a better quality of life. \r\n<p>\r\nIn regards to the business environment, it is very competitive, since the market is full of products that customers can choose. That is why these members find it necessary to leave the center of the city to go to the outskirts so they can make more sales. In the case of the women who sell cosmetics, they only make sales door-to-door, and the market is saturated with salespeople, so they have to be involved in an additional business, like preparing hamburgers that they sell from their homes. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to repair the homes of some of these members, to repair and reupholster their cars, and to buy materials and ingredients to increase their incomes and meet the basic needs of their families. Since this is a new group, they don't have much experience in group loans, but they trust their fellow members and know that they are hard-working, capable people, with a strong desire to get ahead. That is why the Agrocapital foundation is giving them this economic support to help them grow and improve themselves.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

Mar\u00eda Luisa and consists of thirteen members who are working parents who strive relentlessly to support their families through their businesses.  They are responsible and cooperative people who have demonstrated in their previous six loan cycles that they are capable of working together.  Now that they have had the chance to get to know each other well through their hard work, they look forward to continuing together as a group.  Among the retail businesses represented are the sale of food, handmade dresses, clothing, soft drinks, bread, groceries, cosmetics, and empanadas.  The men are engaged in the repair of air conditioners, refrigerators, and other appliances.  With regard to the competitive environment, the members do have any difficulties because they offer their products and services every day from strategic locations throughout the city.  Many of them have a loyal clientele that they have established as a result of many years of experience.   For example, the members who provide air conditioning services do not face financial difficulty because they have agreements with institutions to provide comprehensive maintenance.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to improve their home and businesses.  The members will purchase supplies and materials for making bread, snacks, empanadas, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salte%C3%B1as\" target=\"_blank\" >salte\u00f1as<\/a>, as well as tools and equipment to improve the services they provide.  Others wish to invest in new businesses by acquiring a variety of merchandise to offer.  Their expectations for the future are to see their businesses well\u2013stocked so that they can provide better service to their customers and improve their product offerings so that they can keep up with new market demands, which will help them earn more income so that they can provide a better quality of life for their families.  Most of the members are experienced in working as part of a solidarity group.  They are aware that the entire Communal Bank is responsible for any shortfalls caused by any member who is late or fails to make a payment.

He is very grateful to Kiva partner Ceprodel, which has facilitated four loans for him.  Franklin hopes to continue working with Ceprodel in the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva

She has been in business for more than 13 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vicenta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC, which she used to buy supplies to make more food. She is applying for a new loan, for 15,000 PHP, to buy additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to improve her living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is a leading cooperative in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita G. is 47 years old and married with six adult-aged children. She lives in the village of Mambabanga, a barangay of the municipality of Luna in Isabela province on Luzon. Carmelita is the leader of a ten-member group that received a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmelita owns and operates a retail store from which she sells seafood products, including fish and shrimp, to the local community. She has been in business for over three years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nThis year Carmelita joined ASKI to gain access to their financial services. She is requesting a loan, her first, of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and maintain working capital. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that one-on-one translations of entrepreneur profiles are costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":477617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She is 61 years old. Feliza is the leader of a 19-member group loan sponsored by ASKI. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFeliza is married and has 9 adult children. To make a living, Feliza runs a food stall where she sells fruits and vegetables. Feliza has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Feliza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Feliza is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Feliza's fourth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 36 years old. Lucrecia is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLucrecia is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Lucrecia raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Lucrecia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lucrecia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucrecia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the first loan taken out by Lucrecia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

M. is from the village of Magsaysay, Cabatuan, Isabela. She is 33 years old. Grace is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Grace owns & operates a general store where she sells both food & daily use products in the local community. Grace has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Grace joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Grace is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Grace from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Annielice R.' Group.\r\n\r\nAnnielice is married and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling eggs in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty-three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annielice joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nAnnielice is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 36 years old. Analyn is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAnalyn is married and has three young children. To make a living, Analyn raises pigs for fattening and for sale. Analyn has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Analyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the first loan taken out by Analyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 25 years old. Makenly is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Makenly B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nMakenly is married and has an infant child. To make a living, Makenly raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Makenly has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Makenly joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Makenly has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. Makenly is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the third loan taken out by Makenly from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeth M. is from the village of General Balao, Solana, Cagayan. She is 37 years old. Janeth is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<P>\r\n\r\nJaneth is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Janeth works in someone else's business venture in the retail sector, operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Janeth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Janeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Janeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<P>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

D. is from the village of Bagong Silang, Iligan City. She is 38 years old. Flora is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Flora owns and operates a business venture raising livestock in the agricultural sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Flora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Flora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Flora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a 26-year-old woman from the coastal town of Cardona, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. She is married to a jeepney (small bus) driver, Aaron James, who is 28 years old. They are blessed with four children. The eldest child, Julianne, is 7 years old and in grade school. The youngest son, Julian Carlo, is a 3-year-old. The couple is working hard to raise their family and give their children a better life.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Katlyn joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. When she received her previous loans, she invested the money in the preparing and selling of dried fish, and later expanded the business with more fish.\r\n\r\nNow on her 3rd loan, she requested 15,000 PHP as additional capital for her business. She is positive that her business will grow since she already has regular customers from other villages requesting orders.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a space in the market where she can sell her dried fish. She hopes for a successful business that can provide them with a good life that is far away from poverty. She also dreams of building a concrete house to live in with a happy family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":478358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"additional

is a 39-year-old married woman with five children aged between 18 and 25 years, all of whom go to school. She also takes care of additional family members. She resides in and rents a three-roomed house where she lives with six people. The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets two meals a day.\r\n\r\nJackline owns a fish stall and works in Naguru, a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of twenty-five customers a day, selling to all categories of people both wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nJackline incurs transport costs to and from buying fish from Gaba landing site but her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are the transportation of fish from Gaba to her stall in Naguru, seasonality which makes her business difficult, and the rainy season which disturbs her a lot because she works in an open place.\r\n\r\nJackline has been in her business for ten years and with MCDT for eight years. She is servicing her seventeenth loan working with the same group members. Jackline joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women at the village level.\r\n\r\nJackline wants to use this loan to buy more fish. She is hoping to see her business grower bigger and to start selling wholesale

is 42 years old and married with six children aged between 10 and 23 years. All her children go to school. She rents a four-room house where she stays with eight people. Hadjah takes care of additional family members. The family has no access to electricity or piped water and gets two meals a day. She incurs transport costs to and from buying baking flour and cooking oil. Hadjah fries samosas and chapatti in Kawempe. She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala.  She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people at wholesale and retail.  Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, school fees for her children and rent for her residence. Her major business challenges are transporting the baking flour, cooking oil and cowpeas to her business premises; seasonality, which makes her business difficult; and the rainy season, which disturbs her a lot because she works in an open area. Hadjah has been in this business for 10 years and with MCDT for five years. This is her 10th loan working with the same group mates. Hadjah joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women in the village. She wants to use this loan to buy more cartons of baking flour, jerry cans of cooking oil and a sack of cowpeas. She hopes to see her business grower bigger and to start employing three people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":478394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":" To
