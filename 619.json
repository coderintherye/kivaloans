is a 71-year-old villager from Iyri-Suu village. He has worked as a mechanic for all of his life and was really eager to study so he could instill a love of learning in all of his seven children, three of whom became teachers. In 1960, in order to find an additional means of subsistence for his family,  he started his activities in a cattle-breeding business.  With the initial capital of 15,000 KGS, he managed to develop his business with the monthly profit of 3,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nBeing a very purposeful and positive person, Kalmyrza works hard to support his family, and today he has one cow, twelve sheep and seven horses at his farm. Kalmyrza plans to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to increase the number of cattle.

She lives in the Los Altos del Bosque neighborhood of the city of Cartagena with her husband and three children aged 22 to 26. She dreams that her children may fulfill their own dreams. They are her inspiration in the independent work she does, in which she makes clothing, especially women's clothing. She began her work looking for an income opportunity to support her husband's leadership in their home, without neglecting the education and upbringing of her children. This was the reason she went to school to study dressmaking, by which means she would achieve her two objectives. Finally she started up her venture, beginning with a dressmaking shop in her own home.

is a jack of all trades. From serving in the Army to working at Lockheed Martin to running his own business, one thing has remained constant in his professional life: the business of fire extinguishing. \r\n\r\nJohn first experienced the fire extinguisher business during his time in the Army. From 1963-1966, while stationed in South Korea, a medical issue prevented John from getting clearance to work in the field, so he remained on the base working with fire extinguishers. During this time, he got certified with the National Fire Protection Association to work with fire extinguishers, a fact which would serve him well in the years to come.\r\n\r\nAfter his release from active duty in 1966, John continued his work in the business. He got his state license to work with civilian fire extinguishers, which he says wasn\u2019t a problem because of his experience in the Army and the referrals he secured from that work. Shortly afterward, he began working for Lockheed Martin, and, in 1993, he added another full-time endeavor to his career. While continuing to work for Lockheed Martin, he began running his own fire extinguishing business, servicing clients as large as the University of Texas.\r\n\r\nFor medical reasons, John retired from Lockheed Martin and his business when he qualified for retirement benefits in 1998. He then spent several years working on a music career, working mostly with nursing and retirement homes. However, after the music equipment became too heavy for him to manage himself, he decided, in 2010, to get back into the fire extinguisher business.\r\n\r\nJohn started \u201cIt\u2019ll Work Fire Extinguishers\u201d in May 2010. In his own words, \u201cWe sell and service fire extinguishers to residential, commercial, restaurant, and industrial businesses.\u201d As a result of his previous experience owning a business, John says that it only took about one year for business to pick up. Though he says that \"It\u2019ll Work\" is operating with about 60% of his previous client base, business is growing along with the economy, and he anticipates significant growth in the coming years. \r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s loan will allow him to purchase a \"Supercan\" into which he dumps the fire extinguisher\u2019s chemicals after service. He will also purchase a Dry Chemical Extraction pail with a mechanism to fill the fire extinguishers. Finally, he will make a down -payment on his insurance, pay the state registration fee for the business, and, as he says, will \u201cprobably do mail-outs (advertisements) with the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan will take John\u2019s business a long way and will allow him to continue providing safe and reliable service to all of the clients in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1236.83,"image":{"id":796486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

Kyrgyzstan).  She is 49 years, a widow and has four children.  Sanabar was born in a simple family.  Being the oldest child in the family of ten children, she spent the majority of her time taking care of the household, such as looking after her younger brothers and sisters, doing household and caring for a small farm.  During her childhood, Sanabar dreamed of becoming a teacher, but her life forced her to pick a different destiny.  She finished school in 1980, and, according to an old tradition, her parents married her off to the Alay district in 1981.  The young family had their first child in 1983.  According to the sharia law, newlyweds remained living in the parents' home because Sanabar's husband was the youngest son.  Sanabar's husband diligently worked at a collective farm, and Sanabar took care of the domestic animals.  By that time, they already had two young children.  The collective farm allotted them very little land because at that time, one family got only 200 square meters.  It was impossible to grow anything on such a small plot of land, and the family's expenses exceeded the profits.  Years passed, and the family grew to six people.  Sanabar's husband was a leading farmer in his native village, but disaster fell on the family in 2002, when Sanabar's husband was killed by unknown men.  Five years later, Sanabar and her children decided to move to the Chui valley.  The family bought a house in 2007 in the Poltavka village and started a livestock breeding business with the purchase of one horse.  Four years passed since then, and the family experienced many challenges during this time, but thanks to Sanabar's persistence and hard work, her business became successful.

Ivan is seeking his first loan to buy supplies for his restaurant. His business began when he opened a very small restaurant with his wife as the cook. Her food is outstanding, but at the beginning they served only friends and acquaintances. As they learned more about running a restaurant, their business became well known and customers now seek them out. Right now, he continues to work with his wife and has hired a friend as a helper. Their business is going well because it has a good reputation. He hopes that this loan will help him increase his income.

The couple has three children, all at school and in their care. Z\u00e9nabou Titlayo and her husband live with their children. For almost ten years Z\u00e9nabou Titilayo has been selling cosmetics and underwear on a door-to-door basis; this allows her to provide for her own needs as well as those of her family. She buys her products in Togo and in Benin. In order to satisfy customer demand she is requesting a loan with the second member of the Adjenia group. This loan will allow her to satisfy customer demand more readily and to make more money.

She says that obtaining her license to practice public notary was the simple part; the difficult part was building up her reputation and gaining clientele.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways that Patricia has been able to build clientele is by offering several more services than the average public notary, including income tax filing, income tax preparation, mailing services and immigration paperwork. \r\n\r\nAs a native Spanish speaker, Patricia is also able to provide access to all of these services for the Hispanic communities in the Texas-Mexico border city of Brownsville, where her business is located. Because many of her clients are not educated in the complexities of the government documents necessary to stay and work in the U.S., access to translations of these documents is of the utmost importance to them. She partially attributes her loyal clientele to her ability to provide these much needed services.\r\n\r\nPatricia feels that her business has had two major successes so far. The first was the speed with which Loop Services was able to expand its clientele base. The second was a letter she received from the Internal Revenue Service thanking her for all of the people that she has helped with her business. Of this letter, she says, \u201c(the letter) made me really happy because I enjoy helping my customers in whatever they need, even if it is just translating something for them.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn the future, Patricia hopes to expand her business to offer still more services and employment to her Brownsville community. She hopes to begin offering payment services for bills, money transfers, and money orders. Currently, she employs one other person, but she hopes that the expansion of her business will allow her to offer more employment to those who need it.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Patricia bought a post box, painted her office, purchased two desks, and installed an office alarm system. She is in the process of dividing her office space into two different offices, reserving one side for public notary and the other for the services she wishes to add. The loan will also pay for the equipment and licenses needed for these new services. Finally, with the remaining money, Patricia will invest in publicity for her business to bring in more clients.\r\n\r\nHer experiences in business have led Patricia to advise new entrepreneurs never to lose hope. She says, \u201cI always saw my business as a job; you work to provide good customer service, and, if you\u2019re doing well, the clients will come back.\u201d With this simple, yet effective, business philosophy, Patricia hopes to continue expanding her business and serving the community around her.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1371.5,"image":{"id":798320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

The group's members are:\r\n\r\n*Mar\u00eda Isabel, who will use her loan to buy perfumes, make-up, jewelry, etc.\r\n*Mar\u00eda Teresa, who will buy bleach, air fresheners, Fabuloso (a household clearner) and liquid soap, by the gallon\r\n*Emilia, who will buy men's boots in different colors\r\n*Viridiana, who will buy ladies', men's and children's shoes and ladies' underwear\r\n*Yazbeth, who will buy individual items of Tupperware to fill orders and also buy some wholesale\r\n*Isindy Anahi, who will buy ladies' clothes, denim pants and different styles of blouse\r\n*Oralia, who will buy napkins and aprons by the dozen\r\n\r\nOralia is 35 years old and studied up to high school level.  She is married and has one son called Roberto who is 6 years old and currently in pre-school.  Oralia sells napkins for tortillas and for covering food.  She requested her loan to buy napkins and stock her business.  Oralia started her business three years ago.  It was her mom who taught her how to sell napkins.\r\n\r\nMany salespeople from different communities come to the Tepalcingo street market to sell their products.  It was there that Oralia saw napkins being sold by the dozen.  She used some savings that she had to buy several dozen napkins with which to start her business.  She started to sell her products in the Tepalcingo street market which is located in the town center, 15 minutes from her home.\r\n\r\nThis business is very important because it helps Oralia's family financially.  She feels proud to be able to work in her own business, take care of her young son and serve her customers in a kind and friendly manner.  She is happy to be receiving this loan from Kiva because she will use it to stock her business so that she can grow and have a range of different types of napkin to offer her customers, who are housewives.  Oralia uses some of her profits to re-stock her business and also uses some to cover her household expenses.  Her dreams and hopes are to get ahead in life, and for her son to study and get a good job.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Many thanks for supporting people who need it.

Su primer negocio lo tuvo hace 11 a\u00f1os cuando con un capital de $ 200 COP, invirti\u00f2 en ropa interior y consigui\u00f2 clientes generando sus primeros ingresos; a esta actividad fu\u00e8 agregando prendas de oro, luego calzado y bolsos, construyendo as\u00ed una buena clientela, que ha ido creciendo con el transcurrir del tiempo.

The children go to school, and they are the driving force for Martha\u2019s daily efforts.  She rents washers, and she sells varied merchandise via the credit system and installments that her customers have agreed upon.  \r\n\r\nShe gets income from these businesses that strengthens the well-being of her family.  She has had her first business for 11 years.  She invested $200 COP in underwear, and she got customers and generated her first earnings.  She was adding gold jewelry to her business, and later she added footwear and purses.  That way she was building a good customer base, which \r\nhas been growing over time.\r\n\r\nNow she also has a business where she overs rents washing machines.  Housewives, who have been exposed to the sun when hand washing the families\u2019 clothes under San Juan Nepomuceno\u2019s burning sun, have responded to this business.  San Juan Nepomuceno is a municipality where everyone knows each other and where its people live among their relatives.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the second loan she has had with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy another washer as she wants to respond to her customers in a timely way.  During the week some cannot wash their clothes because all of the machines have been in use.  She will also use the loan to buy varied merchandise like purses and footwear.  They turn around very rapidly because she makes her purchases by customers\u2019 orders.\r\n\r\nHer dream for later on is to have a commercial spot where she can display her products in an orderly way, and where she has the option of selling merchandise that turns around quickly for cash.  Martha is a woman with a lot of dreams.  She has managed to support her children\u2019s education through her work.  She will very assuredly keep putting forth effort to reach a greater profitability than the current 11%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":463.65,"image":{"id":798510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a washer and merchandise like sandals and purses to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-25T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98947},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":114260},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116450},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118682},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":120957},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":123276},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125638},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":128046},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130501},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":133002},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135551},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":154690}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.07},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.07,"local_amount":98947,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":99748.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320431,"comment":null},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":114260,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":115185.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803548,"comment":null},{"amount":65.99,"local_amount":116450,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":117393.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614634,"comment":null},{"amount":67.25,"local_amount":118682,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":119643.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568587,"comment":null},{"amount":68.54,"local_amount":120957,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":121936.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779923,"comment":null},{"amount":69.86,"local_amount":123276,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":124274.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188321,"comment":null},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":125638,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":126655.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T01:00:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310458,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":535,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to repair her old house.

Meanwhile, her daughters stay in the kitchen cooking the corn that they will later take to grind to prepare the delicious tortillas.  Now Sonia has decided to buy the corn and sugar she needs to make her tortillas and drinks at wholesale.  This way she can lower the cost of her ingredients and also have a greater quantity of both products on hand, because at this point her she does not have enough of these products.

Arnold believes, like most poor Filipino parents, that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children, as he himself has been an undergraduate.\n\nArnold operates a variety store, which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. Arnold earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house and his regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 800 in daily sales.\n\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Arnold is requesting a PHP8,000 loan. He will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \n\nArnold hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his children will be able to graduate one day and finish their studies. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":798880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery products and inventory items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-06-27T11:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arnold","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474179,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636963,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.03,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2312.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005273,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-27T13:55:02Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310535,"name":"Ulfat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ulfat is 45 years old and married with six children.

She is married to Rogelio, a mechanic, and they have one child. By the grace of God, Melinda has managed to support her child's schooling. She is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses\r\n\r\nMelinda oversees operations of the family's jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a single unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Melinda and her husband also manage their motor repair shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Melinda is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy new accessories and parts for the jeepney and to buy some equipment for the repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her businesses.  \r\n\r\nMelinda dreams of being able to buy another jeepney or to put up new repair shops in other places soon. She also dreams that her child will finish his\/her education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins as they were first used by American soldiers to help the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn income and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney. It is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the items that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance
