The loan will be used to buy basic grains that are necessary for her business. Her desire at the moment is to work hard so she can capitalize her business so that in the future she can improve her house and improve the quality of life of her children.

B. is from the village of Poblacion 3, Clarin Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products such as canned goods, some food for snacks, noodles, eggs, salt, sugar and other daily use products in the local community. Annabella has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Annabella joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annabella has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. Annabella is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Annabella from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in a two-room brick house in an area called Asghar colony. \r\n\r\nShe has given birth to four sons and three daughters. Her first three sons couldn\u2019t complete their education because of the family's poor financial conditions and started doing work. They all do different work to financially support their family.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The current unemployment rate in Kyrgyzstan is extremely high. If educated citizens are in search of jobs, then unskilled workers have lost hope completely. Unfortunately, our nation cannot provide every citizen with a worthy job, so most workers have to be headed abroad. The Russian Federation is the best option for workers. First, the language is not a barrier. Kyrgyzstan as a former Soviet Union Republic still uses the Russian language as a second official one. Also, Russia is in great need of cheap labor, so this cooperation benefits both sides. In many families in rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, at least one member of the family is employed abroad. \r\n\r\nGulnozkhon T., 44, is from a village called Aravan in Southern Kyrgyzstan. Her husband left to go to Russia in search of better opportunities to earn money. There, he works as  a construction builder.  Her older daughter is a seamstress and the family is getting ready for her upcoming wedding. Gulnozkhon\u2019s second daughter and a son also help out about the house.  The family business is cultivating and selling cotton.  The purpose of the loan is purchasing a dowry for her daughter\u2019s wedding, broadening her business by raising livestock also and making repairs in their house. \r\n\r\nGavharoi R., 40, is involved in raising and selling bulls. Her husband and two sons work in Russia.  She plans to spend this loan on purchasing more livestock and broadening her business. She would like to spend her profit on finishing the construction of some of the rooms in her house. \r\n\r\nTakhir T., 39, raises poultry. The purpose of the loan is to start raising livestock and reselling it. He plans to spend the profit on developing his business and on repairing the house. \r\n\r\nOktyabrkhon E., 43, raises livestock. She also does dairy farming. She needs this loan to finish the construction of her house and arrange weddings for her daughters.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Etaf's returns are good but she wants to enlarge the project and cover a larger area, so she came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase coops and feeding trays.\n\nEtaf hopes that one day she can rent a bigger place and have a proper farm, providing better opportunities for her children. Etaf's son appears in the picture here on the farm as Etaf is very religious and uncomfortable having her picture online.\n\nImportant information about this loan:\n \nFFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit our FAQs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":633702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To improve the farm by purchasing coops and feeding trays ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":"Jabalia-Gaza Strip","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2010-11-07T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Etaf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1120,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.43,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":97.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182604498,"comment":null},{"amount":93.42,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188743689,"comment":null},{"amount":93.41,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":93.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191481779,"comment":null},{"amount":93.42,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":93.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195908441,"comment":null},{"amount":93.41,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-19T08:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201831350,"comment":null},{"amount":91.39,"local_amount":90.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T08:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206450181,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":93.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":93.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211292601,"comment":null},{"amount":188.52,"local_amount":187.69,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":188.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221888056,"comment":null},{"amount":92.71,"local_amount":92.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":92.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227112402,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":93.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":93.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232873863,"comment":null},{"amount":93.79,"local_amount":93.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":93.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238690120,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-07T22:50:29Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:15:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":245157,"name":"Sok-Heang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sok-heang K.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's FAQs.

is a young woman from Deir Al-Balah in Gaza Strip. She comes from a decent family. Reem wanted to start her own business after finishing school so, one year ago, she rented a small space and started a beauty salon offering services to her friends, neighbors and women of the area. Reem wants to expand her salon and serve a larger number of customers, especially now that the salon has started to prosper. She wants to help her parents pay the house rent. Reem came to Kiva's partner, FATEN, asking for a loan to purchase makeup and the beauty accessories she needs.\n\nReem appears in the photo.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

For 5 years they have been working hard on rented land where they sow potatoes, peas, beans, and other vegetables which, after each harvest, they sell in the central marked of the city Tarma.

In very little time he will be able to buy his own land. He predicts that this will bring him greater income and he will be able to buy much more.

Her life is centered around the care of her plots of land which is where she spends most of her day.  Her main crops are different varieties of potato.  Her good character helps her when selling her products in the central market in the city of Tarma where her customers are good payers and are aware of the quality of her goods.  What upsets her about sowing crops is when blight and pests take over her tubers, causing great losses.  However, this does not stop her.  For this reason though, she would like to be able to keep her plots of land, clean and healthy.  This is the eighth loan she has had from MFP and she is grateful that she has had the support of her community bank and been able to sow her crops.

It is a marginal urban area which is very densely populated and known as the 'jail district' since the women's jail of Portoviejo is found there.\r\n\r\nThis is Dolores' third loan cycle with her community bank.  What she most likes about her community bank are the health talks since she learns a lot from them.  Dolores is 26 years old and lives with her common-law husband.  They have two children, aged 10 and 11, who are in school.  Her husband is a construction worker.\r\n\r\nDolores sells household products such as irons, blenders, fans, bed linen, etc.  She also sells all kinds of clothes and shoes.

This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11000 to use as additional working capital for her food vending and sari-sari store businesses so that she can continue to save for her future security and to help  her grandson finish school.

This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Emelia  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She receives orders from her neighboring areas and fills the order on time to earn income for the family. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a private entrepreneur and involved in a food-selling business. He sells a dish named \"Gol Gapay\" which is very famous among people here. It has a round shape and is made with flour and served with chilly sauces and yogurt. Because of its spicy taste people loves to eat it.  He visits different streets of the city with his four-wheeled cart to sell the food. Nasira also helps her husband in preparing the dish so he sells a good quantity every day. \r\n\r\nNasira is a mother of 4 sons. Two of them are enrolled in school while the other two stay at home. Nasira wants to provide education to her remaining two sons also for which reason she works very hard along with her husband. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. He will invest the loan in purchasing required items such as spices, cooking oil, yogurt and flour in bulk quantity to improve his sales. He has been doing this business for over 20 years and Nasira is hopeful that this investment will bring more profit for her husband. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

She has five children, two of whom are already working while three are staying at home managing the household and helping her with the business. By the grace of God, Eden has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nEden operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at the  wholesale price and selling at retail. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nEden dreams of being able to renovate her house soon through profits from all of her work.

E. is from the village of Talisayan, Misamis Oriental. She is 32 years old. Analyn is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Analyn owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap, junk food, toothpaste, and canned goods, in the local community. She also buys and sells gasoline by the liter and agricultural feed for pigs by the kilogram. Analyn has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Analyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory, and as working capital for the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Analyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

G. is from the village of Tagbocboc, Gingoog City.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fish like milkfish, mackerel, and salmon in the local community. Glenda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Glenda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glenda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to buy and sell. Glenda is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory, and as working capital for the fish business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Glenda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Members are located in Preaek Reang village in Kandal province and will use their portions of the loan in varied ways to improve family living conditions.  \r\n\r\nMr. Moen earns a little money to support his family as a motorbike taxi driver while his wife, Mrs. Sok Ney Vorn, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate vegetables to sell.

They live in Preaek Touch village in Kandal province. The group selected Mrs. Saroeun S., a 39-year-old married woman, as the group's leader. Each member of the group will use their portion of the loan for a different purpose. \r\n\r\nMrs. Saroeun S. is a farmer who owns 10 hectares of land where she cultivates rice and vegetables, but she lacks the money to support it.

C. is from the village of Binakalan, Gingoog City. She is 49 years old. Clara is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Clara owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, junk food, instant noodles, and canned goods in the local community. Clara has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Clara joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clara has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Clara is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Clara from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is the young mother of one daughter and three sons. She is married to Ibrahim who runs a bakery in the city. The family lives in Gaza City in Gaza Strip. The bakery, which is their only source of income, produces different kinds of bread, including locA. breads such as Lebanese, Iraqi, etc. Buthayna and her husband started the bakery four years ago. The bakery supplies a large area around the center of the city as it's the only one producing a large variety of bread. Buthayna came to Kiva's partner, FATEN, for a loan to purchase larger amounts of wheat flour and baking materials as they are planning to double their production and increase their returns.\n\nButhayna's husband appears in the the bakery photo as Buthayna is very religious - as are most Gaza Strip citizens - and doesn't want her picture posted online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

At present she works in the big market in San where she is in great demand from her customers due to the high quality of her produce.\r\nIn her efforts to find additional financial resources, she decided to turn to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution two years ago. This is her second individual loan from the association.\r\nMrs Foun\u00e9 N. intends to purchase 600 kilograms of fresh fish and 450 kilograms of smoked fish. Up until now she has bought her supplies from the retailers of San, but with the expansion of her business she intends to go to the banks of the river to buy directly from the fishermen. She sells her wares every day at the big market in San for cash to a clientele made up of women and men. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 102.500 FCFA which she intends to use to repay the loan, keeping the remainder to help her husband with family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":634440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of fresh and smoked fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-05T15:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Foun\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613663,"comment":null},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752099,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606361,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918009,"comment":null},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360936,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":59640.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-05T18:24:33Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":245508,"name":"Hishigjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hishigjargal D. is 35 years old and lives with her husband and two daughters in the Arhangai province of Mongolia.

V. is from the village of Tinabalan, Gingoog City. She is 42 years old. Helen is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, detergents, sugar, snack foods and canned goods in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Helen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Helen is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":634485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Z. is from the village of Sta. Cruz, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. He is 29 years old and single. To make a living, Henry owns and operates a business venture operating a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from fishing and selling of fish like salmon, sardines, and milkfish in the local community. Henry has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Henry joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Henry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in and expand the business. Henry is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP that will be used to purchase tools for boat maintenance. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Henry from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Minsapinit, Misamis Oriental. She is 40 years old. Helen is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Helen owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling firewood in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Helen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional firewood. Helen is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Helen from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jovelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Cruz, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. She is 36 years old. Wilma is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Wilma owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fish such as sardines, milkfish, \"bilong-bilog\", & \"matang baka\" in the local community. Wilma has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Wilma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilma is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Wilma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Sta. Cruz, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental. She is 36 years old. Serebic is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Serebic owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling fish like sardines, mackerel, \"bodboron\", & salmon in the local community. Serebic has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Serebic joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Serebic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Serebic is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Serebic from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Liza has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Liza joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Liza is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Liza from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.
