These entrepreneurs have applied for a loan of SLL 1,500,000 (or SLL 500,000 each) from SMT, a partner of 'Shine on Sierra Leone' in Waterloo. With a loan at their disposal, they can expand their businesses by adding more goods. Consequently, sales and sales-to-profit margins will increase for these entrepreneurs. They will thus be able to better support their children in terms of feeding, clothing and in paying their school fees and other school related expenses. <P>\r\n\r\nMamusu was born in Kambia, in northern Sierra Leone.

Her children are between the ages of 28 and 50 years, and some of them go to school.  She resides in and owns a four-room house, where she lives with six people.  Edith takes care of additional family members.  The family has access to electricity and piped water, and generally eats three meals per day.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, Edith has a stall in Nsooba, where she sells crafts.  She incurs significant transportation costs because she has to travel to purchase bananas and crafts in villages throughout Uganda.  She works, seven days per week, in a semi-urban area, which is located in the outskirts of Kampala.  On average, she has 50 customers per day, and sells to all kinds of people (i.e., both retail and wholesale customres).  Her largest monthly expenses include: costs of feeding her family; school tuition fees for her children; and rental dues for her market stall.  Among her major business challenges are the seasonal nature of the business and the rainy season, which makes it difficult for her customers to reach her stall (because she works in an area that can be muddy).  She has been in this business for ten years, and she has been with MCDT for six years.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe is currently servicing her nineteenth loan.  Edith joined MCDT because it was near her home and because it helped poor women.  She is seeking this loan in the amount of $725 to buy more crafts.

The profit will be shared between the above-mentioned activities and the family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":448345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy cereals and condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T02:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa Niamana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":75681.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152460,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":75681.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991299,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75681.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021574,"comment":null},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":75681.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T15:48:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":161947,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is thirty \u2013 nine years old.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 35 talas or US $15 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fuata joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Fuata's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n About  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Epi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Epi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Epi's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15 \r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Epi are provided by SPBD:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Annie needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Annie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Annie's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15 \r\n\r\nThe following social metrics are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Makerita needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Makerita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Makerita's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Makerita are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15 \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Pelepesite joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Pelepesite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pelepesite are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":448593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase

The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, providing general clothing services to local community members.  Senerita has 3 years of experience in this business.  Senerita needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Senerita joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Senerita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nYou can view Senerita's previous loan on Kiva at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=18742\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Senerita are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 29 years old. Charibel is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCharibel married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Charibel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food products in the local community. Charibel has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Charibel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charibel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. Charibel is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Charibel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is from the city of Sta  Cruz Tangub City. She is 48 years old. Nicanora is widowed and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Nicanora owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling banana cue in the local community. Nicanora has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nicanora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nicanora is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nicanora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":448803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Y. is a 33-year-old woman who lives with her husband and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. In 2002, her family sold all of their livestock and moved from the countryside to the capital in hopes of improving their lives. \r\n\r\nAs soon as Byambajargal settled in, she started her own small business selling flour at the local food market. She buys flour from wholesalers and resells it at retail to local residents. As her business grew, she increased her inventory to include rice and sugar as well. The family has a small second-hand, Korean-made vehicle with which Byambajargal's husband, Damdinsuren, transports her flour, rice and sugar from the wholesale market. To increase the household\u2019s income, Damdinsuren also runs a taxi service in town.\r\n\r\nByambajargal is requesting a loan to purchase more flour to increase her inventory. She is a humble, shy and hard-working person. She says, \"I have a dream to have my own grocery store one day to ensure my only son's future life.\"\r\n \r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001 and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It was the first microfinance organization to be established in Mongolia, but it has now expanded to include mainstream commercial operations. \r\n\r\nXacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\r\n\r\nTo get regular updates from XacBank, please join our lending team:

She is 42 years old and lives with her family in Karabalta, a provincial town. Because of unemployment, many residents left town for the capital Bishkek or to go abroad to find work.

You may know, the local climate and landscape are pleasantly agreeable for raising livestock and agricultural activities.

The younger son is 17 years old. For the time being, he is at home and is not working. Both Lilia\u2019s sons actively participate in tending the livestock. Therefore, Lilia does not encounter any sort of difficulty in her work. Lilia applied for a loan, in order to purchase gasoline and motor oil for working plots of land in the spring.

To many people, the life in this rural area does not seem to be that attractive. There is an extremely high rate of unemployment in this city. Therefore, many young people have left the city to look for a job in the capital. Nevertheless, Jyparkul and her husband have chosen to stay. Instead of moving to the capital and starting from zero, they have preferred to create opportunities where other people have already dropped their hands. \r\n<p>\r\nJyparkul is 42. She and her husband are happy parents as they have four sons. Their sons' ages range from as young as 5 to 21. Previously they had ten sheep. They invested their savings thriftily and were able to buy cows and calves. After that, they bought horses and started to trade in cattle. Now, the livestock they have include two horses, three cows, four calves and 30 sheep. Due to this business, they have been able to marry their son. Their two elder sons help the parents look after the cattle. So Jyparkul and her husband do not have any difficulties looking after that many cattle. Their monthly income from trading in livestock is up to $230. This is a good income. Jyparkul decided to apply for a loan to purchase seven or eight sheep and a calf. She wants to increase the total population of their livestock in preparation for marrying off the rest of her sons.\r\n<p>\r\nJyparkul is the leader of this group. Jyparkul\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nNazgul, 36, married, with four children. Nazgul stays at home and feeds up a horse for sale. She needs a loan to buy a foal.\r\n<p>\r\nAibubush, 59, is retired. Together with her husband, she raises cattle. She needs a loan to buy calves to raise.\r\n<p>\r\nAizada, 26, has two children. She stays at home and looks after cattle. They have four cows and ten sheep. Her husband is a taxi driver.

After her husband\u2019s death, Jamyikan has been living alone as her children are grown-ups and live separately.\r\n<p>\r\nMost people of Jamyikan\u2019s age after becoming grandparents prefer to live in their children\u2019s homes. Jamyikan as well, could easily live at her children\u2019s expense. But, Jamyikan has never asked her children for help. She does not depend on her children. Moreover, at many times she helps her daughter financially and always cares about her children.\r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living Jamyikan trades in dishes. She purchases different kinds of dishes: ceramic dishes, dinner sets and porcelain.\r\n<p>\r\nJamyikan is an experienced businesswoman. She used to trade in various convenience goods as long ago as when she was young. Then she applied for a job and started to work for Government. After the retirement, the pension appeared to be too little to sustain a decent living. So Jamyikan did not hesitate and invested all her early savings, about 70$ in purchasing dishes. She returned to her former occupation of trade.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, she cannot afford a big scale trade. Nevertheless, her engagement brings her a stable income of 65-75$ each month. Jamyikan has applied for this loan to invest it in purchasing different kinds of dinner sets, porcelain, etc. as the New Year is approaching, when many people organize grand arrangements, feasts and buy dishes as New Year\u2019s gifts.\r\n\r\nJamyikan has three partners:\r\n<br>\r\nMairamkul, 53, is a widow and has a son. She sells women\u2019s clothes and hosiery. Her monthly income is around 45$. Mairamkul needs a loan to purchase winter clothes for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nRaisa, 38, has four children. Her husband works as a driver. To support her family, Raisa trades in silver and gold. She hopes to obtain this loan and import silver from Turkey and India.\r\n<p>\r\nAnarkan, 46, is divorced. She has a retired mother and an unemployed sister. Anarkan works as a seller in a bookstore. Anarkan\u2019s salary, is just 12$ a month. Her mother's pension is 80$.

The older two children are in school.  For the past two years he has been in the business of producing and selling in Kigando  making 50,000 weekly profit. Zeuliya says that his business is mostly affected by the poor and expensive transportation system.

T. is from the village of District 2, Cauayan City, Isabela.

The main source of income for the business comes from butchering and selling pork in the market. Melba has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP daily.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Melba joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melba is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Melba from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and North-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A., 43, is from the village of Cabaruan. She is married. To make a living, she owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Zenaida has been engaged in her business for over  years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Zenaida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Zenaida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and North-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Cabu-an, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling coconuts in the local community. Shirley has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirley joined HSPFI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirley has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. Shirley is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the third loan taken out by Shirley from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a 54-year old woman, married and blessed with 3 children. They are currently living at Lagundi, Morong Rizal, Philippines. She is also a woman of strong faith to overcome all challenges to achieve her dreams. <p>\r\nIn 2000, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.) a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines.  As a member of ASHI for almost nine years, she has shown very good performance in her credit rating (basis of loans); therefore, she is being trusted by the institution to acquire larger loans. <p>\r\nShe runs a variety store with a frozen foods section and also a little carenderia (ready-to-eat food). She started her variety store through her initiative and knowledge of dealing with customers. Her business is growing because the people in her neighborhood like her products and find what they need in her store instead of going to the town proper. She is requesting a loan of PHP 45,000.00 to use for additional capital to improve her business and her income.<p>\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other places. Her children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store business. She hopes that this business will be the source of income to finance the needs of her family and to have a comfortable house to live in.\r\nPurita now feels very happy about her work and the service of ASHI and Kiva. It offers her big opportunities to make her dreams come true. She is grateful to ASHI for supporting people like her who want to work and get ahead. She hopes that they continue this way for a long time and help many families and enterprising women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":449022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Dario G., a farmer.  She is a diligent and careful mother of two children.\r\nMyrna's husband's income is not enough to meet the needs of their family. Therefore, in 2005, Myrna got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She was given hope and a way to have access to capital, so she started her printing business. The business went smoothly and brings them good income. She is also involved in the farming business and they help each other in running their family businesses.\r\n\r\nCurrently on her sixth loan, Myrna proposes the amount of Php 30,000 as additional capital to purchase stock and more supplies for her printing business. Stock includes items such as T-shirts for printing, assorted paints, and silk; the loan will also be use for purchasing fertilizer for their farming business.\r\n\r\nMyrna has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-KIVA for her business, in order to gain more profit and to use that profit to support daily expenses.\r\n\r\nShe has been an ASHI member for four years (4).  ASHI paved the way for the achievement of the dreams of her family, to send her children to school and to finish their studies with a degree. She also hasn't stopped dreaming for her grandchildren, and wants to offer them the best education, such as she provided for her children. The couple feels very happy with the loan that made their lives to be better than before. Myrna wishes all lenders all the best and good luck and will continue to support her family and the expanded business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":449100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase

Kholniso is a 31-year-old man who is married with two children. Thanks to his father (pictured), who is a farmer, Kholniso has been associated with this business since he was young. He purchases the sheep in the local market and then he breeds and sells them. The sheep are kept in the house and it takes a lot of effort to care for them. Every day, Kholniso gets up early in the morning in order to feed the animals. All day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the sheep. Kholniso says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with proper education. Now, Kholniso would like to expand his business and purchase more sheep. For this purpose, he has applied for $900 USD and with your help he hopes to reach his aim.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Isak sells dried fruits in the local central market. He has had this business for 5 years already. Dried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan. Any hostess has some in store for serving, in case guests arrive at the house. In addition, dried fruits are, as a rule, served during all important family occasions, such as wedding parties, birthday parties and the like. Considering the constant demand for his goods, Isak's business is quite successful and brings in a stable income for his family. Isak has a large and friendly family, who always try to help each other. Now, he wants to increase his stock of goods so as to be able to better meet the demands of his buyers. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of $1,500. He will spend the loan on the purchase of dried fruits in order to increase the range he has for sale. Isak has already demonstrated himself to be a good client and has a positive credit history. He would like to thank everyone for their support, and promises to pay back the loan on time.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the past 13 years, Umar has worked in agriculture and the raising of sheep. He raises sheep which he cares for greatly since thanks to them, he can cover his household expenses through the milk which he sells in the mornings. Umar showed us his animals with great happiness as his sheep were about to be vaccinated against the various sicknesses that affect that type of animal. For Umar, it is very important to work his land and raise his animals which is why he is currently seeking a loan in order to expand his business. This will help his family generate additional income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

6, respectively.  This client currently dedicates himself to the activation and sale of cell phone chips.  He was previously on the staff of the Ministry of Defense.  He resigned in 1998 after 10 years of service because his salary did not permit him to support his wife and his then two children, nor much less allow him to expect a life even halfway respectable.  This is how, that same year, he joined the Sales Department of a personal electronics enterprise and then later started selling pre-paid lines.  Since then, he has worked buying electronic chips to sell himself.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo states that he had never been able to expand his business until his loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, because he lacked the necessary documents required by other financial entities and banks in order to obtain a loan through them.  Once finally able to access credit, he obtained a site for his business in the city of Lambar\u00e9.  His store is stocked with cell phone accessories as well as activation lines, and he also sells pre-paid lines.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for helping him with his first loan and, thanks to this help, he now has his own store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

S. is from the village of Inasagan, Aurora Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 51 years old. Celerina is single and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Celerina owns and operates a business venture that raises crops. While it is not the only means by which revenue is generated, the business' main source of income is from the planting and harvesting of bananas for sale. Celerina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Celerina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living conditions and ability to engage in business activities. Celerina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This earlier loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Celerina is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Celerina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
