This area is known for its beautiful beaches, its cuisine and the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Ana Mar\u00eda.  She is 63 years old, married, and has four children who are all now grown up and independent.  Her husband is a shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nMore than ten years ago, in order to earn a living and provide for their family on a daily basis, Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband used a small amount of money they had to set up a small grocery store in their home.  They started out with very little but now, thanks to loans, they have been able to expand the business and, as time has gone by, they have also added school supplies and some homeware products.  Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband work every day, from 6.00am to 8.00pm.  In some seasons their sales increase a lot but in others not so much.  However, all the same, it makes them enough to support themselves.

She believes her business is doing well because she is responsible and hardworking and, most of all, because she graciously attends to her customers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because, with the support that they have offered her, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her clothing business (clothing for the fall season). This will allow her to offer a wider variety of items and keep fighting every day to realize her greatest dream: \"To have my own shop.\"\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1052165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise (winter clothing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-27T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-26T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth Milagros","last_name":"Quiroz Rivera","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":142.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":145.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":152.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":169.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":173.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":187},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":193.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":201.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407150,"name":"14 De Febrero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ricarda es miembro del Grupo Solidario 14 de Febrero, tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera de dos hijas, las cuales le ayudan econ\u00f3micamente, son buenas hijas, responsables y trabajadoras.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvangeline dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

He is a living example that despite the pains and problems than may come our way, you keep going. Five years ago he became a widower. His wife had an illness from which she could not recover. He then became father and mother to his daughter, who is now 26 years old. He struggles every day to provide a better future for her and so that she will be proud of him. He also wants to show her that with sacrifice everyone can improve his life. He lives and works in the city of Pisco in San Andr\u00e9s district, where the beaches are beautiful. One of the district's principle activities is fishing, which is Pedro's occupation.\r\n\r\nPedro works from morning to night as a fisherman and specializes in catching shellfish. He gets up at dawn to go out in his boat. He learned to fish at a very early age from his father, which encouraged him to become a fisherman. He believes that his business is going well because God is always with him. He also has an angel, his wife, at his side watching him; so he goes out each day with a great deal of faith. \r\n\r\nPedro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders whose support will let him do maintenance on his on-board air compressor and motor. This will mean his boat will be safer and he can avoid accidents that would be regrettable.

The brand of the car he has bought asks for the highest repair costs; since the car had not been technically checked when he bought it, and as it already shows mechanical flaws due to constant use, he needs to have it repaired; it is for this reason that the loan he is requesting will be used to pay for the maintenance works on and for the general repairs of his car."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1052161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for the maintenance of his car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-03-28T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-27T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henrry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407818,"name":"Romania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia se sigue dedicando al negocio de restaurant,ella prepara desayunos,almuerzos y cenas,la socia trabaja desde las 8:00 a.m hasta las 8:00 p.m,por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a sus hijos,el sue\u00f1o de la socia es ampliar el negocio de restaurant.La socia solicta el credito para comprar mesas,sillas y tambien para comprar productos para cocinar como arroz,pollo,carne y verduras.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"\r\nThe member continues to be dedicated to her restaurant business.
