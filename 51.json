Ambigo M. is 30 years old.  She is married with three children and lives in the town of Mlolongo that sits along the Mombasa -Nairobi highway.\r\n\r\nSera graduated from one of the largest referral hospitals in East Africa, Kenyatta Medical Training Center, in 1999 and started operating her clinic and pharmacy shop in 2006.  She began the clinic with initial capital from savings she made while employed at the Kenyatta National Hospital as a doctor (USD $1470). \r\n\r\nEquipped with her savings and her technical skills, Sera approached her husband, who is also a qualified doctor, and together they started the clinic and pharmacy shop.  They decided to start their business in Mlolongo because it is a very fast-growing town.  The couple rented two houses to host the clinic and hospital.  The business continues to grow as many patients seek their services.  The town is located along the only highway connecting Mombasa and Nairobi where many medical emergencies occur.  Also, Sera is able to perform labor deliveries, sending any complicated cases to Kenyatta Hospital in Nairobi.\r\n\r\nThe clinic and pharmacy have saved so many lives that Sera cannot recall the number and she wants to continue with this trend for many years to come.  She wants to add more stock of drugs to her clinic and pharmacy in order to cope with the increasing demand for medicine.  She, therefore, is requesting a loan of $1,175.  With this loan, Sera will be able to purchase drugs and supplies like syrups, tablets, injectables, and bandages.  This will greatly improve the services she is providing, save lives, and also increase her income.  \r\n\r\nThe repayment period is 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":87010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical Clinic","sector":"Health","use":"To purchases an assortment of drugs including syrups, tablets and injectables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-12-02T05:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-16T08:37:35Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":75000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116402,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136250,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158973,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183736,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211311,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239468,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268438,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":297618,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":118,"local_amount":7531.91,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7634.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328214,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":7212.77,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7310.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":361991,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-02T08:37:35Z","paid_date":"2008-10-17T07:04:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":25120,"name":"Christabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christabel A. is 60 years old.

She is 37 years old, and she comes from a poor family. She is married and has 3 children. Two years ago, while jobless, she decided to open her own business. Shokhret and her husband (see photo) rented space, bought tables and chairs, dishes and equipment for a cafe. But returns from the business were so low that Shokhret did not have the money to fix up the old cafe and as a result her clients started to leave the business. In order to stop clients from leaving, Shokhret asked for a $500 loan from the Norwegian Microcredit partner of Kiva. She will use the money to renovate the cafe. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\u0413-\u0436\u0430 \u0428\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0435\u0442

K. lives in the town of Saatli of the Republic of Azerbaijan that is located in the South Caucasus. She is 47 years old, is married and has 3 children. Her family is large and poor, and it is getting more difficult to make ends meet in the conditions of mass unemployment in her town. Thurfa's only hope is the piece of land where she raises some chickens. Her son (on the photo) helps her in this business. He sells birds and eggs at the local supermarket. Part of the earnings must be spent to purchase two month old baby chicks. This purchase takes a serious toll on the family's income. If they had their own eggs and appropriate equipment, they could grow their own baby chicks. Part of them could be sold and another part could be grown. Thurfa approached Norwegian Microcredit that is partnering with Kiva to help her obtain a $500 credit to purchase eggs and special equipment for baby chicks.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna

K. was born and lives in a village near the town of Saatli in the Republic of Azerbaijan. She is 45 and not married. In order to make a living, Manzar together with her brother (on the foto) rented space and refurbished it as a workshop to repair home appliances. Even though Manzar's brother, who is good with repairs, does a lot of the work, she tries to help him. For example, Manzar helps with purchases and deliveries of spare parts, finding new clients and so on. Now, Manzar decided to obtain new equipment and to fix up the studio, in order to improve the work environment and attract more clients. This is why Manzar turned to the Norwegian Microcredit organization to obtain a $600 credit.\t\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\u0413-\u0436\u0430

every single day, one can find Catalina nestled behind a fragrant pile of herbs and flowers that she sells in the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. As one walks past Catalina and the other women lined up on either side of her on the busy city sidewalks, the relaxing scents of mint, thyme, and oregano waft into the air. Catalina brings these herbs and flowers fresh cut from the countryside every single morning and continues selling until the sun sets. Her clients consist of everyone from mothers preparing the daily meal to lovesick boyfriends buying flowers for their sweethearts. She even sells to traditional healers who use these herbs as medicines, as each one has a specific healing property, explains Catalina. For example, thyme is often used in teas to ease an upset stomach. <P>\r\n\r\nFlowers and herbs are not the only thing Catalina sells in the busy city. She and her husband own a small field just outside the city where they plant and raise several different types of potatoes which are then sold in Ayacucho and two times each year taken in large loads to the capital Lima where they are also sold in the markets. Additionally, Catalina buys large supplies of cereals such as corn and barley which she sometimes sells along with her flowers and herbs. <P>\r\n\r\nCatalina says it is only thanks to her village bank that she has been able to venture into so many markets. Thanks to the economic support she has received through loans, she was able to purchase her field and begin growing potatoes, as well as begin buying and selling cereals. With the money she has been saving in the bank, Catalina has many goals she wishes to accomplish. First and foremost, Catalina is intent on funding the education of all 9 of her children, three of whom are already studying in the local university. In addition to this, Catalina would also like to make improvements to her home. She is currently requesting a loan of US$ 500. The majority of this money will be spent on fertilizer for her potatoes, as they have just recently been planted and are beginning to grow.

Once each week, a large bus is rented to take them just outside the city limits of Ayacucho, Peru, where they purchase huge supplies of wood to bring home and craft.

The majority of her time is dedicated to the sale of beauty products. Much like Avon or Mary Kay, Sandra sells \u201cEsika\u201d beauty products. She is an obvious natural as she loves to chat and socialize with her customers who come to her for every beauty product need from shampoos to perfumes to cosmetics. She loves her work, she explains, because she has turned something she loves to do into a moneymaking business. In addition to \u201cEsika,\u201d Sandra and her husband have created a successful business selling ornamental fish. Their home is filled with four small aquariums and one giant aquarium that house beautiful fish of all varieties. They are shipped from Lima and her husband attends to the customers who stop by to pick out their new pet. <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough she loves the work she is currently involved in, Sandra is very excited about a new venture. She has recently finished taking classes at a local university where she learned how to make stuffed animals and she now has orders rolling in to create fun toys for children. It takes her about 2 days to create one extremely large stuffed animal which she is able to sell for about 40 Nuevo Soles (US$ 13.50). The majority of the orders she has filled so far have come from teachers wanting to decorate their classrooms, which serves as a great way for Sandra to advertise her new product. Sandra really feels fulfilled doing this business because she is able to use her creativity and takes much pride in her final product. Her goal is to eventually turn her newfound talent in making stuffed animals into a fulltime business. <P>\r\n\r\nSandra has been involved in her village bank for nearly 10 years, and she loves it. Thanks to the loans she receives, she is able to pursue her passions with economic security, and this is very valuable. She is currently working hard to save her money to be able to send her son on a class field trip to Cusco.

These Lilia also sold and continues to sell in the market from her stand. The cereals consist of everything from wheat to barley, and they come from the country just outside the city limits. After several years of selling only cereals, it was clear to Lilia that she was not making enough profit to support a healthy lifestyle. Thus, she decided she needed to increase the variety of products she sold in order to supplement her income. This she did, and it is now to vegetables that she dedicates the majority of her time and energy. She happily reports that her decision was a great success, and she now serves a large number of regular customers counting on her for their daily supply of leafy greens and cereals. It is a very important business concept, explains Lilia. If one does not provide a variety of products, the customers will shop elsewhere. <P>\r\n\r\nThis motivated 27 year-old has many goals and aspirations for her growing vegetable business. She says she is always looking for ways to improve, and she has her eye set on a permanent stand within the market. Currently, Lilia is an \u201cambulante,\u201d which means she sells from a mobile stand and spends most of the day walking. A permanent stand would allow her greater consistency and the supply of a much greater quantity of products. This is an especially important time for Lilia to be expanding her business as she is newly pregnant with her first child. Thanks to her village bank, such expansion is a real possibility. For the past 3 years, Lilia has learned how to save her money and she says thanks to her bank, she has increased exponentially the amount of products she is able to move daily.

Nearly twenty years ago when she married her husband, she assumed the administrative duties in his carpentry business while he took care of the manual labor. Graciela joined her village bank and began taking out loans and together, the happy couple built a thriving business. All the while she was administrating the carpentry business, Graciela describes how it was a dream of hers to open her own independent grocery store in order to further supplement the family\u2019s income. Little by little, she saved her money and eventually accumulated enough capital in the bank to open a beautiful little grocery store out of her home.<P>\r\n\r\nToday, seven years after opening her grocery store, Graciela is the proud owner of her own thriving business. She has wisely acquired a photocopy machine as the students and teachers attending the nearby high school are always in need of copies. As time passes, Graciela continues looking for different products she can add to her store, giving her an advantage over her competition. <P>\r\n\r\nGraciela lists a number of goals and reasons to be saving her money at this point in time. First of all, her 17-year-old son is about to enter the local university and would like a computer for his studies. Graciela is very proud to be saving towards such a goal. A second reason she saves is to pay for medical treatments, as she has recently fallen quite ill. She suffers from severe kidney pains and a grave case of hemorrhoids. To this point, the treatments she has received have been unsuccessful, and she plans to travel to Lima, Per\u00fa, for better medical attention. <P>\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Graciela is very grateful to have been a part of her village bank for the past 15 years. Thanks to the value of saving she has been taught, Graciela has some savings in the bank to pay for things like medical emergencies and educational opportunities for her son. Apart from the economic help she receives, Graciela happily describes the lifelong friendships she has made that serve as a distraction from the difficulties of life. Graciela hopes to invest the $350 loan she is requesting in her husband\u2019s business.

Beatrice is a business minded lady and 7 years ago she realized that her husband meagre income could not support the education of her children, its on this background that she started her own business of selling cereals in Liten market. After undertaking a business training conducted by Ebony Foundation, she is now able to manage her business well. The demand for her products has also greatly increased and sometimes she runs short of stock, to counter this she needs to double her reorder level. She is therefore requesting for a loan of US$ 1200 which she intends to spend as follows US$ 1000 buy 60 bags of dry maize and US$ 200 buy 10 bags of beans.

A group of housewives in Karangsari village (West Bali) used the island\u2019s name as its group name. Menjangan group is a group of village housewives who meet every week in the village hall for money saving and loaning activities or conduct cleaning activities in the neighborhood. This group is lead by Ni Nengah Suarniti with Ni Ketut Suwitri as the secretary and Ni Luh Warni as the treasurer. This group has 15 members. Besides the money saving and loaning activity, this group also runs pig farming business at their own houses. This business was not coordinated well so that they had not earned maximum profit. The livestock had not been treated and fed well due to lack of knowledge in pig farming. After getting consultations and counseling about group management and good ways of pig farming from Dinari, Menjangan group plans to raise high quality piglets and to buy good quality pig\u2019s food so that they can produce pigs with quality that meets the market\u2019s standard. Each person needs a fund of Rp. 1,400,000 (about $148) which will be used to buy 4 piglets that cost Rp. 250,000 (about $26) each and Rp. 400,000 (about $42) for the food expense. After raising the pigs for 5 months, the Menjangan group will sell the pigs at the same time. The marketing will be coordinated by Dinari so that the group will have good selling price and on-time payment. With better group management and knowledge, they feel quite optimistic that the business will go well and they can still run the money saving and loaning activities since the part of the profit is kept in the group savings.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u201d Pulau Menjangan\u201d adalah sebuah pulau di Bali barat yang merupakan kawasan wisata untuk diving dan snorkle. Oleh sekelompok ibu \u2013 ibu didesa Karangsari, Bali barat, nama itu kemudian dipakai untuk nama kelompok. Kelompok Menjangan adalah perkumpulan ibu \u2013 ibu didesa yang kegiatannya adalah melakukan pertemuan setiap minggu di balai desa untuk simpan pinjam atau untuk mengadakan kegiatan bersih \u2013bersih dilingkungannya. Kelompok ini diketuai oleh Ni Nengah Suarniti, Sekretaris oleh Ni Ketut Suwitri dan Bendahara oleh Ni Luh Warni.

Kegiatan ini belum terkoordinir dengan baik, sehingga mereka tidak mendapatkan hasil yang maksimal. Ternak mereka belum mendapat perawatan dan pakan yang memadai karena kurangnya akan pengetahuan yang baik akan beternak babi yang benar. Setelah mendapat pembinaan dan pelatihan tentang manajemen kelompok dan pemeliharaan babi yang baik dari Yayasan Dinari, kelompok Menjangan berencana untuk memelihara bibit babi jenis unggul dan membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga akan menghasilkan babi yang sesuai dengan standar pasaran. Masing \u2013 masing orang membutuhkan dana Rp. 1.400.000.- dengan perincian, membeli 4 ekor bibit babi @ Rp. 250.000.- dan Rp. 400.000.- untuk biaya pakan. Setelah 5 bulan masa pemeliharaan, kelompok Menjangan akan menjual babinya secara bersamaan dengan dikoordinir Yayasan Dinari untuk pemasaran sehingga kelompok akan mendapat harga yang terbaik dan pembayaran bisa dilakukan tepat waktu.\r\nDengan manajemen kelompok dan pengetahuan yang lebih baik, mereka optimis usaha mereka berjalan dengan baik dan kelompok bisa tetap berjalan dengan simpan pinjamnya karena sebagian dari keuntungan penjualan digunakan untuk pengembangan kas di kelompok."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":89411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

hope. By starting pig farming business, Kondri has recovered little by little from her poverty. With initial capital of Rp. 1,000,000 (about $107), Kondri bought 3 small pigs that she raised for 4 months. The pigs turned out to grow quite well and ready to be sold. One pig can be sold at Rp. 800,000 (about $85). The net profit (after deducting the pig\u2019s food expenses) is Rp. 85,000 (about $9) per pig per month. From this profit, Kondri realized that if she had more capital, the earned profit would increase. Currently, Kondri needs extra capital of Rp. 3,000,000 (about $320) for purchasing more small pigs and pig\u2019s food. She hopes the business will grow faster and more profitable.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMenjalani hidup seorang diri tidaklah mudah untuk Ni Wayan Kondri karena setelah suaminya meninggal, Ni Wayan Kondri  tetap harus menjalani hidup ini dan tidak boleh berputus asa. Dengan memulai usahA beternak babi, Kondri sedikit demi sedikit mulai bangkit dari keterpurukan ekonominya. Dengan modal awal Rp. 1.000.000,-, Kondri membeli bibit babi sebanyak 3 ekor, setelah dipelihara 4 bulan ternyata babinya berkembang dengan baik dan siap dijual. Perekor laku terjual Rp.800.000,-. Keuntungan yang diperoleh setelah dikurangi biaya pakan adalah  Rp. 85.000.- perekor per bulan. Dari  keuntungannya inilah Kondri melihat bahwa jika memiliki lebih banyak lagi modal usaha, tentulah jumlah keuntungan yang didapatpun bertambah. Saat ini Kondri membutuhkan tambahan modal usaha sebesar Rp. 3.000.000.- yang akan dipergunakan untuk membeli lebih banyak lagi bibit babi dan juga untuk biaya pakannya selama pemeliharaan. Dengan harapan bisa berkembang cepat dan juga bisa mendatangkan keuntungan yang lebih banyak."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":89418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

His hard work is solely done for the well being of his wife and two school aged children. To fulfill his obligation, I Made Lotro opens a kiosk at his house. Although the kiosk is still small since his capital is limited, but his persistance made his business really well, and could provide enough for family needs. With a capital of Rp1,000,000 (about US$110), I Made Lotro could make profit of about Rp30,000 (about US$3.30) each day. From every profit he made,  I Made Lotro also save a little to be used to expand other business of raising pigs, specifically mother pig that is done by his wife. So I Made Lotro is not by himself in obtaining family income, but also teaches his wife to take part in family well being. From Dinari's loan, I Made Lotro hopes that his kiosk business could be expanded, by adding variation to his sales, which initally consisted of light food, so that he could also sell other daily needs items.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nI Made Lotro  seorang pria yang berdedikasi tinggi terhadap keluarganya. Kerja kerasnya selama ini semata-mata dilakukannya untuk mengusahakan kesejahteraan istri dan dua orang anaknya yang masih bersekolah. Untuk memenuhi kewajibannya ini I Made Lotro membuka usaha warung di rumahnya. Walaupun warungnya masih kecil karena modal yang dimilikinya terbatas tetapi keuletannya membuat usahanya ini benar-benar bermanfaat dan mendatangkan hasil yang cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya. Dengan modal  Rp. 1.000.000,- I Made Lotro bisa mendapat keuntungan sekitar Rp. 30.000,- per hari. Dari setiap keuntungan yang diperolehnya itu I Made Lotro juga menyisihkan sebagian kecil untuk di simpan dan kemudian dipakainya untuk mengembangkan usaha yang lain yaitu memelihara ternak babi khususnya babi penginduk yang dikelola oleh istrinya. Jadi I Made Lotro tidak hanya berusaha sendirian dalam mengelola keuangan rumah tangganya, tetapi juga mengajarkan istrinya untuk ambil bagian dalm mengusahakan kesejahteraan keluarga mereka. Dengan memperoleh pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI I Made Lotro berharap usaha warungnya bisa dikembangkan dengan menambah variasi dagangannya yang semula hanya menjual makanan ringan  saja, agar bisa  menjual segala macam kebutuhan sehari-hari"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":89476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy sales

In her large garden she raises vegetables such as aubergine (eggplant), tomatoes, and different types of fruit like apples, peaches and plums. She and her husband are unemployed and raising vegetables and fruits is the only source to feed the family. All members of the family help Madine to plant, look after and sell in the local bazaar. Every day Madine wakes up early in the morning to prepare her kids to go to the school and to water her garden. The oldest son left school as soon as he finished 9th grade to help his parents. During the autumn selling vegetables and fruits bring Madine and her family income for the rest seasons, but it is very hard to cover all the needs of so big a family . To improve their life conditions Madine has decided to expand her business and start planting potatoes, cucumbers and peppers. These vegetables are in very high demand in Azerbaijan, especially in summer when many people cook traditional meals using pepper, tomatoes and potatoes very often.

A. is 52 years old, he has a higher education and is an agricultural economist, he is married and has 3 children.  Gulboy owns a farm where he grows a variety of products: wheat, corn, peas, etc.  He is the director.  At the start of the planting season he plans to plant 11 acres of wheat.  He already has the seeds.  He plans to use the loan to purchase fertilizer and petrol to work the land, as they are currently much cheaper then they will be in high season.  <p>\r\n\r\nGulboy will sell his harvest to local residents at a lower price then is available in the market.  The local residents will use the wheat to make flour at the mills and then use it to bake bread for personal use.  This will help them to save money.

For this reason he is requesting a loan of US$ 550 so as to supply enough cabbage, lettuce, peppers, beets, and carrots to meet the demand. This will allow him to better provide for his family. <P><b> Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>Monsieur Messan A. vit \u00e0 Agom\u00e9 glozou o\u00f9 il est n\u00e9 en 1976.

S\u00e9nad\u00e9 A. K. was born in 1972 in Agom\u00e9-Glozou where she is presently living. She is responsible for six persons. Her husband is a teacher and also helps earn the family's living. Unfortunately, Mrs. A. K. does not have enough business capital to be able to satisfy the demands of her customers. Her business is buying and selling bulk quantities of palm nuts for processing. She brings her baskets, bowls and sacks to the women who produce palm oil to purchase palm nuts and send them off to Lom\u00e9 for resale. After 10 years of being in this business of which she knows all the ins and outs, she needs additional capital so that she can purchase and resell larger quantities.

Cecilia U. decided to move into an unexplored field for many micro-entrepreneurs. She has a honey bee business.  In addition, she has a windmill that she rents for grinding corn (an essential component for the preparation of corn tortillas). <p>\r\nThe loans will be used in different ways.  Many women are going to buy thread in order to make huipiles and embroidery.  Clara P. is going to use her loan to purchase more chickens, while Mar\u00eda M. is going to buy another windmill.  Mar\u00eda Y. is going to invest her money in her diner.

Cassava and palm nuts are also very popular in traditional Ghanaian dishes. \r\n<p>\r\nAraba is a member of the lending group, Nyame Beba (meaning \"God will come\") of Elmina. The group members guarantee loans through a group repayment pledge. Peer support provides the incentive to repay; if one person in the group defaults, the group members make up the payment amount. The members of this group have known each other for many years and provide a lot of support for each other as they all work inside the Elmina market.\r\n<p>\r\nOne challenge that Araba faces is the fact that cassava becomes rotten in a relatively short period of time. So, Araba has become a very good saleswoman in order to sell all of her all stock. As a result, Araba now needs a loan to purchase even more plantains, cassava, and palm nuts. She wants to maintain these three products because they are the most profitable for her to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nRight now her youngest child just graduated from high school and is waiting for his exam scores to see if he\u2019s going to university.

For this reason he decided to become independent and form his own business. At first he worked with his father for a laundry-mat, but over time he saw that having his own business would give him more earnings and this is why he came to be independent. He started a little laundry-mat and added a repair service since many of his clients come in to the store without hems on their pants. <p>\r\nNevertheless, each time more, his clients bring their clothes to him, and his few washing machines are insufficient to clean his orders with the rapidness that they deserve. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of $375 that he is willing to pay back in a period of five months. With this money Jorge will be able to buy a second-hand washer that will help him finish his orders in less time. With your help Jorge will be able to improve his business and at the same time benefit his family.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva volunteer <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJorge Luis vio que en su casa estaba faltando dinero para pagar lodos los gastos de la casa y para pagar los gastos de la escuela de sus cuatro hijos.

Since her husband is most often away, she does not have the financial security she needs.  If she need to pay for something, but he is away, she and her family are left stranded. This is why she began to look for a job as a salesperson for standing fans in a furniture store. As time went by she realized that she could increase her earnings if she invested in buying her own standing fans to sell. That way she could cut out the middle man. That is the way she did it, she saved some money and bought several standing fans and began to sell them. Now she has several clients and she keeps looking for more so that she will earn more money. She also sells shoes from a catalog to her friends and clients.

Induk sapi ini sudah dipelihara selama satu tahun. dan  dibuatkan kandang sederhana dari bambu yang berlokasi dibelakang rumahnya. Salah satu induk sapinya sedang hamil  dan akan segera melahirkan. Induk yang satu masih dipelihara dengan baik. Setiap pagi diberi makan pakan olahan dan rumput, pada siang hari diberi makanan selingan seperti kulit kakao dan dedaunan. Biasanya Ni Putu Sutarmi dibantu oleh suaminya,  I Nengah Suardika, untuk mencari rumput dikebun. Mereka saling bantu dalam memelihara sapi, karena untung yang diterima sangat lumayan untuk kebutuhan rumah tangganya dan biaya 2 orang anak yang masih sekolah. Dalam 1 tahun keuntungan yang diterima sebesar Rp.1.500.000,- dengan penjualan 1 anak sapi yang berumur 5 bulan. Pinjaman yang didapat dari Dinari sangat membantu Ni Putu Sutarmi  dalam menunjang peningkatan usahanya. Untuk kedepan  Ni Putu Sutarmi berencana membeli anak sapi untuk penggemukkan, agar bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih banyak."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":90015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

T. is 37 years old, has graduated from high school, is married and has 3 children. He grows and sells farm animals. He has been working in this business for the past 5 years. When Sotiboldi receives credit, he plans to purchase several cows in order to resell them in 40-45 days. With the money gained he will purchase more young cattle for feeding and sale. He will use the profit to purchase animal feed and to support his family. His main customers are meat shop owners from the region. After purchasing the cattle, they produce milk and meat products that are then sold on nearby markets.

is a young 23-year-old retail shop owner.

Within sight of Kyebando on the hillside are million-dollar homes owned by government officials, people running NGO\u2019s, and expat\u2019s. (This is a topic which is absolutely fascinating, very much misunderstood, but is beyond the scope of this article).\r\n<p>\r\nIn Kyebando there are no paved streets, buildings are poorly-constructed, and people navigate along pathways with the occasional whiff of open sewage. It should be noted that there is a very wonderful spirit in these districts. There is vitality to the \u201cstreet scene\u201d that is lacking in communities of more affluence. In Kyebando, everyone knows their neighbors, and mothers watch after their children as they play openly and relatively safely along the paths. As most people are without jobs, much time is spent visiting, laughing and telling stories. There are many small businesses. One reason for this is that starting your own business is the only chance you have to get a job. You may not make much, but you will make something, if you start a business.\r\n<p>\r\nAt Ester's store, she sells soap, toilet paper, candles, dry cells, and soft drinks.

M. is a 27 year-old man who is married with one child. He lives on the outskirts of Nairobi in a town called Mlolongo. He has no other dependents. In the year 2005, he was employed by a Property Management Company. His employment there didn\u2019t last for long; unfortunately, the company collapsed and George had nothing else to do other than to go home. With the salary that he was earning, George had managed to save Ksh 20000 (USD 286) which he used to start a barbershop business. He used the money to buy a shaving machine. \r\n<p>\r\nAfter some time, he noticed that people had a problem communicating since not everybody owned a mobile phone. With the earnings that he made, he bought a community phone in order to curb this situation. The business thrived, but, due to a lack of funds to support the business, it almost collapsed. He used his own talents and skills of patience and hard work and started repairing spoiled mobile phones, selling blank CD\u2019s and selling scratch cards. After a period of six months, his business started booming and customers started flowing into his shop.

These are usually children of deceased brothers or sisters. AID\u2019s and malaria are the largest contributors to the deaths of young adults.

She is the lady in the far left of the photo. Tatto is 35 years old and married with six children. She has operated her restaurant for two years. One day she hopes to be able to build some rental units. She will use this loan to continue buying foodstuffs for her restaurant. Tatoo serves typical Ugandan dishes such as matooke, cassava, posho, rice, beans, Irish potatoes, chicken and beef. <\/p>\r\n<p>At Pearl, loans to groups are the most common. Through its long presence in Uganda, Pearl is able to identify villages that would benefit from microfinance loans. They contact village leaders, religious groups, etc. to see if there is a need and desire amongst villagers. If the need exists, they meet with businesses and begin a month or two of weekly meetings, educating business owners about the risks and benefits of such loans. If agreed, a lending group forms with chairperson, secretary and treasurer, voted in by members of the group. Members chose which businesses will qualify for loans and how much each qualified business member will receive as a loan. The added total becomes the group loan.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is important that this is done by the group members because, as a group, they are all responsible for the repayment of the loan. One would not want a business in the group to default, because it can cost the other members. This type of peer pressure is very effective. Persons in groups create a very strong bond with each other. They are very supportive of each other and members have long histories in groups. Meetings are very business-like and the sense of empowerment is evident. Pearl meets weekly with the groups to answer questions, collect loan repayments and to offer continued education in finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2950,"image":{"id":90086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more matooke, posho, beans and cassava for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyebando","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.9 31.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2007-12-02T00:45:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatoo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hanifah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mastulah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-17T02:50:44Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":491.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":492,"local_amount":833898.31,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":839106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117318,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":492,"local_amount":833898.31,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":839106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137313,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":492,"local_amount":833898.31,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":839106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160097,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":492,"local_amount":833898.31,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":839106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185033,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":492,"local_amount":833898.31,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":839106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212715,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":490,"local_amount":830508.47,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":835695,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240869,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-03T02:50:44Z","paid_date":"2008-06-17T09:13:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":25560,"name":"Vong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Vong P., age 46, works as a construction foreman, earning around $2.40 per day in revenue.

Lake Victoria is the second largest fresh water lake in the world and is just 20km from downtown Kampala. The major fish are the Nile Perch and Talapia. Talapia are native and the perch were introduced. \r\nKato gets her fish from the fisherman. The fish are already smoked, dried and salted. Since there is no refrigeration, this is the only way to sell this product in the villages. Usually these fish are then steamed or stewed in a broth and are eaten in a hearty soup and is very tasty. \r\nKato also sells a very small fish, about the size of a minnow. These are also dried by skewing about a dozen of them on a thin stick and left out to dry.

proudly calls herself a fashion designer. She is 41 and single with three children. She also cares for eight dependents. For the past three years, she has operated a storefront where she has two sewing machines. One is electric and one is manual, used when the electricity goes out. Her clients choose a pattern from one of the pattern books, then they select the material. When their choices are made, Gertrude quotes a price, which is often less than what the item would cost in a store. Sometimes a customer wants to buy a gomesi, or traditional dress. This is only sold as a custom-made garment and can be quite elaborate. \r\nThere are different levels of tailoring shops in the villages. Some are simple, on the street: just a bag of scrap cloth, a foot-powered sewing machine, some thread and a bench to sit on. Others, like Gertrude's, have a storefront, with several sewing machines, a variety of cloth and embroidery to choose from and books from which to choose patterns. \r\nGertrude learned this trade as a young girl, and it is very good for young girls to have a skill if they don't get formal education. Often in villages, it is considered more important that boys stay in school. Without a formal education, young girls become very vulnerable. So, learning a trade or skill which can be practiced in their village is vital. \r\nTo become a tailor is usually a two-year course. During these two years, girls learn sewing skills, independence and self-esteem. The people that start these schools usually have a shop themselves and the classes are a labor of love for these young girls. Gertrude exudes confidence, a confidence born by learning a skill. With her loan, she will buy more cloth and embroidery for her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":90104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase more cloth and embroidery for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2007-12-02T00:45:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gertrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-16T03:42:49Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":67200,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71631,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116714,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":67200,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71631,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136657,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":67200,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71631,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159428,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":67200,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71631,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184249,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":67200,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71631,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211832,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40,"local_amount":64000,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240002,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-02T03:42:49Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:14:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":25573,"name":"Chik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chik N., 29, is married with one school-aged child and lives with her husband in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.

The skills and self-esteem they learn will empower them with a trade that will make them self-reliant. It is hard to overstate the importance of young girls learning skills or trades that will allow them to create their own businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nYoung girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse, diseases caused by such abuse, unwanted pregnancies, and all the lack of opportunities that come from such consequences. The problems often start with families needing them to drop out of school to help at home. It is considered more important that boys stay in school. Once they drop out, their hopes and dreams easily fade away. In addition, there are no paying jobs in the villages. The only way for these girls to attain security may be to get pregnant. Therefore, the ability to learn a skill outside of formal education is vital. With a trade or skill, they can open a business and regain their sense of self.\r\n<p> \r\nThis is where Roselyn has found her life\u2019s work; a labor of love for young girls who need an opportunity in their villages. Not only does she give them a skill and the self-confidence to handle a business, but she makes sure that when they finish school, they own a sewing machine and enough material to open their door to their village clients. Roselyn has operated her business for ten years. She has day and night classes. She has 25 students and five sewing machines. With her loan, she will buy more machines so students do not have to wait to enter her school. Her dream is to open branches of her school in other villages.

is a 42-year-old trader who owns a shop where he sells spare parts for cars, and he rents a small garage.

Since that time, with the income he has earned he built his own garage and continues running his business in new place. He has a large number of customers because Araz can fix the spare parts that he sells. Customers are very satisfied with his work.
