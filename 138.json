Mrs. Oem S. was selected as the group leader; she is currently in the business of selling clothes. In her business, she sells all kinds of clothes, especially those for the young generation. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it and has decided to ask for a loan to purchase more fashion clothes to re-sell. Her husband, Mr. Hoeng Sok, helps her in the business. Mrs. Oem S. is 46 years old and the mother of seven children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while another one is a construction worker. The remaining five children attend the local school. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":211720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

With these ambitions she decided to get help from GHAPE.\r\n\r\n\tShe became a member of GHAPE in 2002 and has successfully borrowed and repaid loans amounting to $400. Christina invested these loans in rearing fowls, rearing goats, and farming crops like cassava, yams, and beans. She also invested part of the loan in a garden, building a house, and buying and selling palm oil. The profit of these loans helped her in providing and education for her children.\r\n\r\n\tWith this loan she plans to continue buying and reselling palm oil. She is convinced that her business is going to be successful because she has been in this business from the day she took her first loans, she has a lot of experience in this business. Also, there is high demand for palm oil in her local community, as palm oil is one of the basic needs of each household. Christina says the profit of this loan will be use to further the education of her children.

S., 43, is married and lives with four of her children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Her husband, Chhen Oeun, is a rice farmer and he makes around US$2 each day. The weather conditions have been difficult for farming in Cambodia this past year and inflation has also been out of control. These factors have played into a difficult economic year for many Cambodians, Sin S. included. In light of these economic difficulties, she is asking for a loan of US$1,000 to purchase fertilizer and land for her husband to grow more rice.

He said he wants to use the loan to buy additional air conditioners, furniture and other things to add to the existing ones. With the loan he also believes he can build more rooms to accommodate travelers and other people who want to have a perfect place to lodge. George says this will also help him maximize profit.<p>\r\n\r\nGeorge belongs to the Trust group called \"Biako Ye\" Trust Group.

is married to Mr. P. God Fred. They are blessed with nine children, six of whom are below the age of 15.  Jennet was unable to further her education because her father could not pay her school fees. Later on, she became blind. Worst of all, a thief recently broke into her home, shot her 10-year-old son, who almost died, and stole money from her house. In addition to this, her children are unable to study freely because of the fees, and they are also unable to have three square meals a day.  \r\n<p>\r\nJennet was motivated by her situation to become a member of GHAPE in 2006. Since then she has successfully borrowed and repaid two loans that totaled 120.000 FRS. The profit from these loans helped her pay her children's school fees and provide some basic needs, such as food for the family.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Jennet plans to buy piglets, pig feed, soya beans, koki beans, and palm oil to continue her business. She is convinced that her business is going to be successful because she has a lot of experience in both pig farming and her restaurant business, and she has many customers. She says the profit from this loan will be used to send her children to school and to do maintenance on her house. \r\n<p>\r\nJennet plans to pay her loan in 18 months, with the first installment being repaid four months from the date of disbursement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":211836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase piglets, feed, soya beans, and koki beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

For the last 10-years, she has been working as a teacher in the Nerpe el Triunfo.  She has 3 children: the oldest is 15-years old and is in the 3rd year of secondary school, the other daughter is 11-years old and is in the 5th grade and the youngest is 8-years old.  Ms. Nubia is known for being responsible, hardworking and very active in the community.  Her companion\u2019s trade is to travel to the colonies of Municipal Nueva Guinea to sell and purchase perishable products.  Both Nubia and her companion share in the expenses of their home as they are a poor family.  This loan, which they believe will be repaid in 12-months, will gradually help them make improvements to their home.  They live in the borough of Comarca el Triunfo, which each day seems to be increasing in population.  Her dream is to have a better home with this loan from AFODENIC and she feels happy to continue working with the institution.  She dreams of having a stable job, good health and that her children continue to study to be successful in life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jenson Abraham, Kiva

They plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Uot S., a farmer, was selected by the members as the village bank to be president. She cultivates rice on a 5-hectar field. Her field is far from irrigation sources so it is very difficult for her to water her crop without a pump. Mrs. Uot S. is requesting a loan to purchase fuel for her pump that is used to water her crop. Her husband, Kung Sambean, helps her on the plantation. Mrs. Uot S. is 54 years old and the mother of two children who both help their parents on the plantation. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

\r\n\r\nMrs. Yue S. was selected by the members to be the village president. She owns a small store in the local village where she sells desserts. Mrs. Yue S. is 57 years old and the mother of a 14-year-old child who attends the local school. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Mr. Tech Banheng, has 1\/2 hectare (1.25 acres), on which he cultivates rice to earn a living. He now faces an obstacle because his field is infertile. To solve this problem, his wife is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field and make the crops more productive. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term (EoT) loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. Members with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

He and his wife, Mrs. San K., are farmers. They face a small problem because their field is infertile. To solve this problem, Mr. Eng M. has decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field and to make his crop more productive. He is 54 years old and the father of two children who attend the local school. \r\n\r\nMr. Kreus C. did not come to the loan meeting, but his wife attended, so she appears in the photograph.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. Members with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

from Tanzania! This is 45-year-old Elizabeth from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has two children, ages 14 and 19. She also supports another dependant because his parents cannot take care of him. Elizabeth runs a genge or a grocery business. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, where general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish are sold. It is the kind of place that local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don't have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. Elizabeth's business is doing good. She works at the business 13 hours day, 7 days week, and she has two employees to assist her. Elizabeth currently earns about $350 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $425 USD so she can purchase additional stock. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Elizabeth thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n  <p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":212163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stock for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T00:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T01:39:43Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348050,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970633,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886850,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436110,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130383,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T01:39:43Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":68921,"name":"Musa Gwichara Tijikomboe Kichemchem Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musa G., age 31, is married with two sons (ages 5 and 3).

Stumai normally buys charcoal from those who produce it wholesale, and she then sells it to customers around her area. Her business is doing very well. She works at the business for nine hours per day, seven days per week; she is assisted by one employee. Stumai currently earns about 500 USD from this business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

After several unsuccessful attempts at a diploma of basic studies, she tried many income-generating activities but ended up doing commerce in children's clothing and in Wax pagnes (highly valued cloth in West Africa).  In addition, she trades in shoes and jewelry (bracelets, earrings, and chains generally called guaranteed in Mali).\r\n\r\nConcerned about maintaining her large and growing customer base, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, with which she has had an association for three years.  She is on her second individual loan following four group loans (solidarity loans with an association in her district), which were all repaid without difficulty. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy:  34 children's outfits, 10 pieces of Wax pagnes, and 10 pairs of shoes locally in S\u00e9gou and at the grand marketplace of Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali).  This stock will be gotten from wholesale merchants.  With a customer base essentially composed of women, she makes her sales in cash at the retail level and also on credit, payable monthly for enterprises, from district to district and out of her home. \r\n\r\nMs. Mahman Sangar\u00e9 intends to realize a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which will enable her to increase the size of her business and to cover the expenses of her extended family.

This is 58-year-old Msiba S. from Dar es Salaam. She is a widowed woman with four children between the ages of 19 and 27 years old; additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents do not take care of him. Msiba has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 1993. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. Msiba's business is doing well. She works at the business for four hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Msiba currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 350 USD in order to renovate her caf\u00e9 and to purchase additional cooking oil, wheat flour and maize flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Msiba thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She works at the business for hours per day, five days per week; she is assisted by two employees. Mariam currently earns about 300 USD from her business and is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to buy teaching supplies such as books, desks and chalk. In the future, she plans to establish a poultry business to help supplement her income from the nursery. Mariam thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":212220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

This is 46-year-old Isabella M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children. Isabella has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 1990. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. Isabella currently earns about 50 USD from her business and is requesting a loan of 275 USD in order to buy additional utensils, cooking oil, rice and maize flour. In the future, she plans to establish another caf\u00e9. Isabella thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":212225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To buy utensils and cooking supplies for her cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T20:50:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T23:44:54Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":65450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348054,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":65450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970637,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":65450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886854,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":65450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436114,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":65450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T23:44:54Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":68967,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce M. is married and has 3 children.

This is 46-year-old Hawa from Dar es Salaam. She is a  widow with five children between the ages of 18 and 27 years. Hawa has been running a kuku or poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital: you can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space; sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. While they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Hawa's business is doing well. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Hawa currently earns about 500 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 675 USD in order to purchase more chicks. In the future, she plans to renovate the kuku house and establish a clothes business where she can sell women clothes. Hawa thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":212238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T00:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T06:46:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348055,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970638,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886855,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436115,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130388,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027196,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613236,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010319,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232630,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T06:46:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":68973,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulina C.

He is single with no children. He owns a shop at the Kabala Main Lorry Park. His shop provides a dual purpose\u2014he sells soft and hard drinks, water, and assorted goods in the front of the shop and inside, he provides computer classes for the local people.\r\n\r\nAbubakarr has had polio, but he refused to become a beggar in the streets, as many other polio victims are doing in Sierra Leone. His dad could not continue paying his school fees when he reached Junior Secondary School (JSS) III.  So Abubakarr began selling a few items like biscuits, matches and cigarettes in a small tray. However, it was very difficult for him to grow from there. He then approached SMT when it began operating in Kabala in 2005. Today, he is very grateful to SMT. He told me: \"SMT is my mother, father, and everything. Without SMT I am no where.\" \r\n\r\nWith SMT's loans, his business began growing bit by bit. He re-enrolled in school and began paying the fees himself. He wrote his WASSE (West Africa Senior Schools Examination) and managed to make good grades. Then he enrolled in a diploma course at the Fatima Institute, Makeni. He has finished his two-year diploma course in Human Right and Good Governance and is now doing another two-year diploma in Development Studies.\r\n\r\nAbubakar's business has grown enormously. Today, he has a generator, a refrigerator, and computers in his shop. With his shop, he is able to support himself well. But in the Sierra Leonean\/African cultural matrix, he has the responsibility of taking care of his aged father, mother, and younger brothers as well as paying for his continuing education. \r\n\r\nDue to his hard work and his polio condition, Care has offered him a scholarship for his current two-year diploma course, but he has many other school expenses. He attends Fatima Institute in Makeni, about 90 miles from Kabala. He thus pays a Le 30,000.00 fare to and fro every week to attend school. In his business too, he faces some challenges especially with the computer school he has opened. He is in short supply of items like turners and copiers. But life is full of challenges he told me. The more income one has, the greater are his responsibilities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":212301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

She makes the soap in Kabala and takes it to surrounding villages to sell. Her husband helps her make and sell the soap. She is seeking a loan of Le 3,500,000.00 to invest in her business. She will buy bags of caustic soda, oil, plastic bags, hand gloves, and other working materials. It is particularly on the caustic soda that she will invest this money on. This is because the price for a bag of caustic soda keeps fluctuating. Now that the price is low, she intends to buy as much as 25 bags, which she will keep so that when the price increases, she will not be affected.\r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loans with SMT greatly improved her life. She is now able to feed, clothe and educate her children, and she has even been able to buy plots of land in Makeni and Kabala. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, sales are difficult for Musu because of the rains. Farmers--her main customers--do not work at this time,  so their clothes stay clean, which makes the demand for soap very low. But with the dry season approaching and this loan in place, she is expecting great sales and more profit. Her immediate goal is to start building a house on the land she bought in Kabala.

Raising kuku or poultry is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for four hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Pelagia currently earns about 300 USD from her business.

Raising kuku (kuku means chicken in Swahili) is popular in Tanzania for a number of reasons. Firstly, raising chickens requires little start-up capital. You can start with a few and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for eight hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Esther currently earns about $200 USD from her business.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

B. is a 54 year old businessman. He is a husband and father of four children, who are currently in school.  He belongs to the community group named 'Adjinyemise' Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee and support one another in repaying their loans. \r\n\r\nHe sells goats and sheep. He buys the goats and the sheep from the northern part of the country and supplies them to restaurant operators. Goat meat is enjoyed by many Ghanaians because of the good flavor and affordability.
