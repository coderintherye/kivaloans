Now, he needs to increase his business, and this is why he is taking out a loan of 5,000 PHP that he will use to buy feed, vaccines, and additional hogs to raise. This business helps Rolando, because it's the only source of income he has to raise his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1052456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed, vaccines, and additional hogs to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Villa Concepcion Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T00:30:06Z","loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":208.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-04-05T01:59:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403286,"name":"Fuente De Vida 1 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Alejandra es casada, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 los 6 a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n primaria, tiene 7 hijos de los cuales estudian 4, se dedica al comercio a la atenci\u00f3n a tienda en general, y a la crianza de animales dom\u00e9sticos, lleva 8 a\u00f1os con la tienda que tiene, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien se dedica al comercio tambi\u00e9n.\n\nOrganiza un grupo para poder solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la la compra de aguas gaseosas, jugos, galletas, avena en bolsa, condimentos, etc. Como tambi\u00e9n para la compra de gallinas y cerdos para crianza.

She is in a common-law marriage with Jes\u00fas, who works for a company and is the father of their 3 children.  The oldest is already independent and doesn't live with her.  She lives with Jes\u00fas and their 2 youngest children:  Mary, 25, and Jes\u00fas, 14.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Estela has a business selling soft drinks.

Seeing that their home was lacking financially, she started the business because of Jes\u00fas' idea.  He advised her to start it, observing that it was in demand because of the hot climate in the area.  She decided to continue with it.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it lets her have an economic income to support Jes\u00fas with their home's expenses.  It also lets her be at home so she can care for and attend to her children, whom she loves very much and of whom she wants to take good care.  They are her motivation to keep working hard.  Her plan now is to expand her business and open a restaurant in her home since Jes\u00fas knows how to cook, and she thinks it is a good area for this type of business.

She promises to make all of her payments on time like she has with her previous loans.  In this way, she will have access to more loans in the future.

He is also happy and friendly. He is single, doesn't have any children and lives comfortably with his parents and his three siblings: Deysi, 29; Yen, 22; and Aron, 19. Kenny makes a living transporting passengers with an automobile he purchased with his savings when a low-cost opportunity presented itself two years ago. He gets up very early in search of customers on the city streets, works until he takes a mid-day break, and then dedicates himself to technical school in the afternoon. He considers his work lucrative because of the good profits he makes. He enjoys the activity because he can manage his free time and focus on his studies. He says that he decided on this work out of the need to earn income because he had a lot of needs that he couldn't afford. Now he feels more calm and comfortable because he has steady income and more free time. However, he tells us that it bothers him a bit when it rains a lot because it makes it difficult to work, but it doesn't discourage him. He plans to finish his higher education and start his own transportation company. This will be his second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he hopes your collaboration will help solidify his plans. He promises to make his payments on time like he did with his previous loan, and he has a good credit history. With the money he is requesting, he plans to invest in the maintenance of his automobile and to purchase spare parts like tires and other items, so he can keep his vehicle in good shape.

Previously, he had made his living planting <i>pataste<\/i> [a long green vegetable, similar to zucchini]. He was motivated to plant this crop due to the high market demand. He has a plot of land of one <i>manzana<\/i> [about 1.72 acres] planted with this fruit and plots of cilantro and spends five hours a day maintaining it\r\n\r\nIn 2001 he began requesting loans from ODEF and he has had 34 loans. His current loan is for 15,000 Lempiras and he will use it to buy fertilizers to well maintain his crops and produce a good harvest from the crops of fruit and cilantro. Hi goal is to continue working with this crop and to improve his production and his income so as to be financially solvent.

He wants to use his loan money to purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can serve his customers faster. He also wishes to use the money to increase his working capital. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called champion agents. Bright is one of the champion agents. This is his story. \r\n\r\nWhen Bright first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 48 transactions a day. Because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shop and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBright is currently living with his grandmother, who is taking care of five other people. He continues to work extra hard so that he can be able to move out of his grandmother's house and get his own place. In the next five years, Bright sees himself as a full blown businessman. He plans to open money transfer shops in two new locations. \r\n\r\nIn Bright's video, the interview is conducted by a representative of Mobile Transactions."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":944547,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2515,"youtube_id":"dS62-5HpqD8"},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions, to hire more people and to increase his working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Ndola","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":4925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bright","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"loan_amount":4925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407324,"name":"Tabitha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabitha is 25 years old, married to Patrick, and  blessed with one child aged  two.

She lives with her son, Jonat\u00e1n.  She takes care of him in her own house in Chalampampa.  She got her own house, which is in a central area of the city, a little while ago.  She feels empowered by this.\r\n\r\nShe says that her main financial income is from selling milk.  She has a farm in Pusqui, and that is where she takes care of her three good quality milk cows.  They produce between 15 and 20 liters of milk a day.  Each time she is done milking the cows she sells the milk to a well-known yogurt factory in her area.  Therefore, when she finishes the day she returns with her own income.  \r\n\r\nDuring her free time she sells fruit on one of the central streets of Pampas.  That is where she gets extra income.

He works as a for-hire driver of a municipal shuttle taxi.  His monthly income is enough only to cover the family's expenses, and this is why he has an additional income from fattening up and selling livestock.

years old, married and raising two children, the youngest of whom is ten months old.  At the beginning of 2010, Damira and her husband bought a house in the Belovodskoe village and, in search of an income source for their family, started their own business in animal husbandry.

She lives with her husband and son comfortably in their own house.  \r\n\r\nLuz\u2019s activity is sewing, an occupation she learned taking courses at an occupational education center in another city to then buy a sewing machine with her savings and since then has had a workshop at home where she takes care of customers who seek her out because of her good finishing touches thereby earning their acceptance; they recommend her to other persons who then become regular customers.  She started the business more than four months ago and she works by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers her activity to be profitable because the profits she earns are greater than in her previous business which was selling vegetables.  She likes sewing as an occupation because of the work it generates that helped her support her spouse with household expenses and with her son\u2019s education costs; they are her greatest motivation to make progress.  But she also comments that it is a bit uncomfortable due to the physical fatigue  caused by sitting in the same position which causes backaches.  However, this doesn\u2019t discourage her and she continues working and putting in her best effort.

Hace poco tiempo volvi\u00f3 a abrir su tienda, pero ha presentado la dificultad de que el ser nuevo en el sector no es muy conocido por sus clientes, adem\u00e1s de que no cuenta con una puerta o ventana con la que se pueda hacer m\u00e1s visible para sus clientes, dificultad que ha venido superando ofreciendo una buena atenci\u00f3n. Otra dificultad que presenta es el poco capital con el que contaba en el momento de volver a abrir su tienda, por lo que a menudo no puede responder a los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes, por la poca variedad de productos que ha podido surtir en su tienda. Con el \u00e1nimo de superar estas adversidades, Gerardo busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a realizar una reforma locativa en su negocio para hacer una venta que le permita estar m\u00e1s visible para los clientes, y a comprar productos de la canasta familiar para ofrecer en su tienda.\n\nGerardo espera superar estas adversidades y continuar progresando en su vida, de modo que pueda tener una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y una mejor calidad de vida para \u00e9l y para su familia. \n","en":"Gerardo has had to deal with great difficulties throughout his life, but his determination to get ahead has always allowed him to overcome them and continue progressing with his family.  When he was very young he started selling snacks and generated enough income to support himself so as not to be an economic burden on his parents who always had economic difficulties.  Some time ago he had to close the store due to health issues, and thanks to his children's collaboration he was able to get his health back.  Recently he re-opened the store, but because he is new in the sector he is not well known by his customers, nor does he have a door or window which would make his business more visible to customers.  To compensate he offers good customer service.  Another difficulty he had was the lack of capital at the time he opened the store, which now means he cannot fill customer orders frequently because of a lack of product variety in the stock he keeps.  In order to overcome these adversities, Gerardo is requesting a loan to renovate his store and display his products, and also buy essential groceries for the family shopping basket.\r\n\r\nGerardo

Then she stokes the charcoal fire and starts with the work of selling the most delicious and flavorful dishes like \u201cjuanes\u201d (a traditional chicken and rice meal) and \u201ctacacho\u201d (a Peruvian dish of fried plantain mashed with pork rind), etc.\r\n\r\nDue to the good seasoning of her food she has a lot of loyal customers because she always gives them a little bit larger portion.  She has been working for a year and a half.  She is happy that it is going well for her, and she can therefore generate income for her household.  The thing she likes about her work is that in the morning she is able to use her time for other activities, which are also fundamental to her income.\r\n\r\nShe has customers every day because she is located in an area that is very accessible to the public.  This allows her to increase her daily income and to provide her family with better living conditions.  In the future she hopes to strengthen the restaurant that she set up with the previous loan.  It is in the process of expanding.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your contribution in order to continue with her objectives.  She pledges once again to make her payments as she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank and to be able to shape a group where all of the people are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy ingredients, supplies, and utensils in order to continue her work.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, he became involved in farming.  He organized his own dekhan farm eight years ago.

She cooks and takes her delicious meals to various sawmills in the city where she has customers that she\u2019s won over thanks to the quality of her dishes; they are very tasty and that turns her customers into regulars.  She\u2019s been working in this activity for four years and she does it alone because her children have to study.  She likes to do her work because she\u2019s always liked cooking; ever since she was a little girl she loved to cook and how much better to earn a living doing something you love.  Besides, it is very gratifying to see the satisfied expressions on the faces of her diners at the moment of enjoying her dishes.  She hopes later on to consolidate her work to continue growing with what she does.\r\n\r\nThis will be loan #5 with MFP so she\u2019s hoping for your collaboration so that she can continue toward her objectives.  On the other hand, she commits to continue being a punctual and responsible client like she was with past loans she got.  Besides, she wants to continue working with her communal bank's fellow members because they are all very kind and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2000 soles to buy supplies and ingredients to continue preparing her delicious dishes as well as vegetables and various meats to offer a wider variety to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1044604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies and ingredients as well as vegetables and meats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":311.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":317.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":316.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":340.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":353.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":361}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407016,"name":"Duo Ruth De Villa Nueva Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Duo Ruth de Villa Nueva.Maria Tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad es unida tiene 4 hijos,ella tiene 7 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la venta de animales,venta de ropa calzado y cosmeticos.nos comenta que esta luchando para darles un mejor futuro a sus hijos y agrandar mas su negocio ella esta solicitando este credito para la compra de ropa, calzado,cosmeticos y la compra de animales para la venta,espera que le puedan dar ese apoyo que ella nececita para salir adelante con su familia y agrandar su negocio.","en":"Duo Ruth de Villa Nueva: \r\n\r\nMaria is forty-seven years old and she has a partner and four children.

Luis hopes his store will generate higher income than what his previous businesses did so that he can offer his family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1045481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy basic staple items to stock his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"Arias ","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":59469},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":61142},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":62862},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":64630},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66448},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68317},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70239},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":72215},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":74246},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":76335},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":78482},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80690},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":82959},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":85293},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":87692},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90159},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92695},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":95302},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":97983},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100739},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":103573},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":106486},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":109482},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":112562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407933,"name":"Myrna Accad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is 59 years old, married, and has five children.

In 1996, in search of a source of income for her family, she started her own farming business - growing onions, with an initial amount of  10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anzirat's persistence and hard work, she was able to grow her business to have a seasonal income of 50,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Anzirat requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy onion seeds and fuel.

What she likes the best about her work is that she doesn\u2019t have set hours. She is able to spend time with her father and her child. Her customers like this crisp product. This is why she searches for the best of the best ingredients, so that her customers are happy. Her business is going well even though prices have been going up because it is not the yucca season. This is temporary and the prices will go down. In the future she hopes to expand her business by bringing regional products to sell at the wholesale market. This is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy with them as they provide her with financial backing. In this way she can increase her working capital. She knows that she needs to be very responsible and more importantly, very punctual. She is happy to be part of the community bank as they are very united. With this loan of 1500 soles, she will buy yucca in order to continue her business. She would like to sell her product on the highways in order to gain new customers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1045561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy yuccas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":237.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":236.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":265.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":271.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408035,"name":"Vicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicent has been in the tea business for five years.

Maria is a single mother and the head of a family with two children, since the father of her children died some time ago and left her a widow and in charge of the household. Since then, Maria has been working hard as a domestic employee, and thanks to this she generates income with which she can support the household expenses. Nevertheless, many times the income that she generates is not sufficient to cover all the household expenses, and for this reason she wants to look for a way to generate additional income for her family. At a very early age, Maria learned how to raise chickens, since she lived for a long time on a farm, and there she acquired a lot of experience. With the intention of resuming this activity, Maria is seeking a loan that will offer her the possibility of constructing a shed to use as a chicken coop, purchasing chickens and caring for them, and thus resuming this activity with which she will be able to generate extra income in her home.\r\n\r\nMaria hopes that in this way her monthly income will continue growing considerably and, in addition, she will be able to create a better quality of life for her two children. Maria dreams of being able to have a big business and that this will allow her to become completely independent and not have to continue working as a domestic employee, since she is very poorly paid.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1045542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Through a lot of effort he was able to buy his own house and there he raised and educated his kids. Now he is separated and lives in a rented home and has since been working in different sawmills in the city in search of wood that he purchases. Later he takes it to his workshop where he forms and molds it to sell to various carpenters who make furniture. He has been doing his work for more than 20 years and has always worked alone because he feels more comfortable that way. He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have an income and manage his own time, as well as being something that he's enjoyed doing since he was very young. He wants to have his workshop and make the furniture himself, but for the moment he's happy because little by little it will come and he expects to achieve that. \r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP, which makes him very happy because he always wished that some institution would give him the opportunity to be able to grow by investing in his business. He hopes to integrate with his group and be as responsible and united as they are. With the requested 1000 soles he will buy more tools for his workshop as well as more wood, and he will keep creating the finished products because his orders are increasing with time.

It is because of this she decided to work, and which at the same time, allowed her to be at her children\u2019s side and not neglect the home. It is how she embarked on her project selling footwear. For two years she has been offering her customers different styles of very good quality and modern shoes, sandals and trainers. As all good women that wish to progress, she has many plans for her life, amongst them are giving her children a good education and being able to have a prosperous business that is profitable, but she knows that she still has a long way to go and for the moment she just wants to consolidate herself more in what she is doing, and later expand her business with other products. This will be her third loan with MPF, she is very happy knowing that she will have financial support, since she will feel secure in advancing with her work. On the other hand, she promises to continue being a punctual client and paying her repayments as they are scheduled.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

In search of a source of income for her family, Mukhabat became involved in animal husbandry in 2003, having started this business with an initial amount of 5,000 som (KGS).  Today, her business contains two dairy cows, three calves and forty sheep.  The earnings from sale of milk and meat products amount to about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Mukhabat requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further expansion of her business.

In order to continue developing her business, Nazira has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and resale.

He then is in charge of carrying them safe and sound to their destinations.  During the entire time that he has been carrying out this job, (18 years), he has learned many things and has several shortcuts and also areas in which he knows that prices have to be a bit higher.  His work is going very well due to the fact that he already knows how to carry out his job in the best way, as well as permitting him to have time to take his children to and from school.  He is very content, as on some occasions he has clients that contract him for hours at a time and which allows him to work less and to reduce the wear and tear on his motor.  Now he is waiting to improve the condition of his motorcycle taxi and to buy himself another one to rent out and gain an additional profit.  This will be his second loan with MFP, and therefore awaits your collaboration to continue with his goals.  He is also committed again to make his payments as in the other loans he has received.  He is very happy to be a part of his community bank since everyone is very united and responsible.  With the requested amount of 1000 soles, he will purchase replacement parts and will order repairs for a few parts that are deteriorating through time, as well as to purchase insurance to to be able to guarantee the passengers he carries to their destinations.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1048785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase replacement parts and to repair his motorcycle taxi, and to be able to update his transportation insurance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":111.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":140.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405873,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 39 a\u00f1os de edad  casado con Jes\u00fas de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen 3 hijos, ellos viven en el distrito de Llochegua.

They all live together in their own house located in the settlement of Mantaro in Pichari District. \r\n\r\nPilar has been farming bananas and cocoa beans in Mantaro for five years.  At first she started farming bananas but soon introduced cocoa beans which are in their first fruit production phase.  She decided to grow cocoa beans because it has a very good market price like bananas.  To date, everything is turning out very well but her inconvenience is that her parcel of land is on the banks of the Apurimac River and every winter the river overflows its banks and washes away her crops.

She makes hard sacrifices for the well-being of her children, serving as father.\r\n\r\nShe says that her husband abandoned them when the youngest of their children was still seven months old.  Since that moment Rayda had to experience many unexpected events working as a farmworker where they paid her a pittance.  But with the little savings she had, she bought a plot of land where she planted cacao and bananas, and currently she harvests the fruit of her efforts.\r\n\r\nNormally she works with the help of her children, but in the harvest season she counts on the labor of farmworkers.
