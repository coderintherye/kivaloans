It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. \r\n\r\nShe earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJamelie hopes her business will grow more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Regarding her life circumstances she is a single mother and has to raise her youngest daughter Tracy who is six all by her herself. Nevertheless, as her character is that of an exuberant and strong woman, she is not daunted by anything and is willing to move forward along with her daughter, who is her driving force and reason for overcoming. Every day Lia goes out very early in search of products from the wholesale merchants of secondhand clothing. From there she heads to her post on a downtown street surrounded by many people who are doing their shopping. There she takes the opportunity to display her products for sale. Additionally, when she isn't making many sales at her stand she heads for the nearby hamlets or pueblos in order to sell her products or exchange them for poultry. She has been doing this work for four years and enjoys it a lot since she is in charge of her own schedule and occasionally may travel. It's going very well for her since she sells a lot, and more when she sells in other places. She hopes to keep working and making progress little by little, and thus in the future to set up a clothing shop. \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy that they would offer her financial support so she can increase her working capital. She knows she will have to be very responsible and above all highly punctual. With the requested amount of 2,000 Peruvian soles she will purchase more items of apparel since she wishes to pass through the hamlets and pueblos which is where she sells more, and so makes better earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.47,"image":{"id":999380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase more clothing.

She is the mother of 3 children, 2 of whom are now adults.  Only Gabriela, 16, lives with her and depends upon her for her education and quality of life.  Maritza is a widow, and this is the key reason she has had to provide for all the needs of the household.  Now she is working very hard so that she can provide a better quality of life for her minor daughter.  Maritza has been running a lathe workshop (a place where they repair linear motors) for more than 14 years; she hires 4 workers to do the heavier work.  She likes this work very much, because she considers herself to be a good administrator, and she always has the contacts she needs to have a good business.  In addition, she is able to offer employment opportunities to more people, and this is gratifying.  She hopes to continue with her work, but she needs to make an investment in some tools and other equipment that she needs.  This will be her 3rd loan with MFP, and she is very content to know that she will have financial support, because in this way she will feel more sure that she can make progress with her business.  On her part, she promises once again to continue to make all of her loan payments as scheduled.  She is very content to be working with the other members of her communal bank, because they are all very supportive and responsible.  With the sum of 2,000 Peruvian soles she requests, she will buy materials and tools for her repair workshop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.47,"image":{"id":999393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy tools to equip her lathe shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-09T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-10T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":305.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":316.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":328.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":330.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":353.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":365.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.47,"local_amount":305.25,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":307.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T23:17:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388754,"name":"Aracely Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aracely del Carmen es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora quien se dedica al comercio de ropa y cosm\u00e9ticos desde hace 6 a\u00f1os.

Ana Luisa says that a little less than a year ago she opened a small convenience store in her home with the support of her husband in order to earn extra income and help him with household expenses and their children's education. She works every day out of her home, opening her store at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m., and she enjoys having a well-stocked store so her customers can always find what they're looking for. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of beans, rice, oil, cookies, candy, soup, drinks, cheese, cream, milk, salt, sugar, ham and canned goods to restock her business. She hopes that with this investment her business will attract more customers and she can continue growing her store.

Of the youngest daughters, one is a single mother and the youngest is in high school. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that more than 22 years ago, she and her husband started to work making and selling bread. When they started, they had an oven to make \"pan de piedra\" (rock-shaped bread). The oven uses wood, but a couple of years ago, they received some monetary support and were able to buy a gas oven, a big mixer and a tray to grow and improve her business. They have always worked selling bread and they get up very early to start making the bread to sell it to the women who take their children to school very early. They also tell us that during the afternoon, they go by motorcycle to sell the bread in other communities and make a little extra money. They do this to provide a better quality of life for their family.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to invest in the purchase of sugar, salt, flour, oil and gas to make the bread.

They live together in their own house where Rosario works hard daily to be able to offer a better quality of life. Rosario is a woman who does not say no to big challenges. When she saw the need for money every month she decided to venture into another job without disturbing her current one, which is as a cleaner in the area.

She is married and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nShe operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Loreta hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Unfortunately she looked after her twin daughters alone, since they were three years old, as her husband passed away. After going through this sad situation she spent her time caring for her young children alone. A lot of time has passed since then; her children are now grown up and with a lot of hard work she has been able to give them the education that they needed. She devoted herself to trading and to providing education in the afternoons to other children with the aim of generating income.\r\n\r\nMaria is a woman who likes to prepare sweets and she makes a living in this activity in her free time. Like a good Peruvian she is a fan of all spicy dishes and she enjoys them a lot. She currently lives in the city of Mala, located to the south of the capital of Peru, Lima. Mala is characterised by its lovely and generous inhabitants of this beautiful little town.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate income Maria decided to set up a bookshop - a bazaar. This shop has been open for approximately 5 years, long enough to have taught her a lot about her business. She tends the shop from 6:30 in the morning until 8:30 in the evening. During this time she serves an average of 18 customers. Her customers always come back and she is sure that it is because of her friendliness and the variety of products she offers. As another activity she sells \"Colado\", made from sweetened beans, which she sells weekly to her customers who live near her house.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva's loans, Maria will be able to buy school supplies and uniforms, and gifts to stock her bazaar. She will also buy some supplies to prepare the colado that she sells. She hopes to be able to increase her sales thanks to the festivities that are celebrated until the month of May. All this effort and business vision will lead her to increase the quantity of her products and so also increase her income as well as being able to save in order to later extend her business, to buy display cabinets, scaffolding and other items. Her dream is to be able to see her business grow and to see her twin daughters married and completely happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":998173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy school supplies, uniforms, gifts and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-10T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-11T12:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":158.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":168.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":194.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":201.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T17:30:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388814,"name":"Mar\u00eda Lourdes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Lourdes es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora de 54 a\u00f1os quien desde hace 30 a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 a vender en el mayoreo tajadas con queso y poco a poco fue creciendo hasta tener una comideria completa.

Kulmira used an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) for the first purchase of potatoes for resale and was able to develop her business to have a working capital of 30,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from the business allowed her to purchase a UAZ car to transport potatoes.  In order to further grow her business, Kulmira requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover.  In the near future, she also plans to use the profits from the loan to make repairs to her home and continue to expand her
