is a 50-year-old farmer who lives in Kampong Chhnang province. S. is a widowed mother blessed with six children: three are married and have ready started new homes, two are students, one works on the farm. S. currently owns a cultivating machine that she uses for her farming. In addition, she uses her machine to plow a nearby farmer\u2019s farmland for profit.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02-\u00c1i S\u01a1n 2 (16-03-02).\n\n\nPh\u01b0\u01a1ng is married and has 2 adult -aged children.  To making a living, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.

Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2000000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2004, Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 20th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":404878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase  genge items in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-13T07:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stella  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868398,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757594,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146688,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984833,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015506,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":153183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T09:29:23Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143755,"name":"Heang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C., 27, is hard work woman who tries to earn money from a suitable job.

By taking advantage of the opportunity given to put up her own business and be involved in process of development,  this mother named Elizabeth D., married to Genciano D. and blessed with four children, is taking the positive steps toward that goal.\r\n\r\nThe family lives in the village of Sitio Pader, Brgy. Aguisan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Of the four children, two have already graduated from college and Elizabeth is very hopeful that the younger ones will also be able to finish their college education and be gainfully employed in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause she wanted to help her husband to earn a living and to sustain the needs of her family, she decided to put up a business using the skills she already had. But she was worried about where she could get the necessary capital for her proposed business. In 1997 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to borrow the start-up capital for a vegetable vending venture at the local market.  She used the loan to buy the vegetable stock to start her business and added a part of the income to add to her revolving working capital. She noticed that her business did well and it was not long before she was able to afford a permanent stall in the market where her regular customers would be able to find her each time they went to the market. \r\n\r\nAs time went on, she was able to borrow bigger loans because she was a good member who paid her installments on time, and she was able to buy more stock to sell. From her buy and sell of vegetables she was able to earn a minimum of Php 5,000 per month. She used part of the income for the education of her children and savings and some portion she used to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 25,000 was used as working capital for her vegetable vending business. She paid all her weekly installment in full within the loan term and now for her next 19th cycle she is borrowing the same amount of Php 25,000 to be used again as additional capital for her business and the income will go to support the continuing college education of her two younger children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":404857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

He has six children and his eldest child is 27 years old now and is already working.\r\n\r\nMost of the harvest is saved for the family's own consumption while the remainder is sold to their neighbors for additional income.\r\n\r\nNelson would like to grow his business more. He intends to fund his farm by buying farming necessities to improve his harvest. Receiving a loan is truly worthwhile since he doesn\u2019t have ready cash to finance his business at present.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":404904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To use for farm financing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

She is 39 years old and married with two grown children. To make a living, Maria Lucena owns and operates a business planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables to sell. Maria Lucena has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $50 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maria Lucena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Maria Lucena is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be her fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Q. previously lived in Zamboanga del Sur on the island of Mindanao together with her family, but the family decided to move back to Negros Occidental in 1991. Before they left Zamboanga del Sur, they sold their property so that they could have enough capital to start a new life in Negros. When they arrived in Negros, they used the money to buy land and planted fruit-bearing trees like calamansi, guava, and pineapple.\r\n\r\nToday Chenita is 49 years old and lives in the village of Sitio Minahan, Brgy. Odiong, Moises Padilla, Negros Occidenal. She is married to Abuncio who takes care of their farm. The couple is blessed with three children who are 12 to 20 years of age, and are all still going to school. Her older son plans to join the military in Bulacan when he graduates from the Negros State College of Agriculture in Kabankalan City, and this is why Chenita and her husband are working really hard so that they can help their son reach his goals.\r\n\r\nTheir small farm earned a good income for the family and Chenita started a pig-fattening business to supplement their income from the farm. In 1998, Chenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she needed fresh capital to buy fertilizer and other necessities for the farm and her pig-fattening business. When she paid off her loan, she borrowed new capital and started to sell generic medicine in her community. For all her efforts she earns a $340 monthly income from her various businesses.\r\n\r\nPreviously, for her 14th cycle loan, she borrowed Php 11,000 to use as capital for her businesses. That loan was fully paid in full and on time without any delays. For her 15th cycle loan she is borrowing Php 20,000 to use as additional working capital for her generic medicine business and to buy fertilizer for their farm.  Whatever additional income results from the loan will be used for the education of her children and for the expansion of the businesses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

G. is a 43 year old single mother who lives with her father and two children in Khar-khorin, the capital city of the ancient Mongolian empire. Her father is retired, and her two sons are both high school students. She lives with her family in a ger, a traditional Mongolian housing tent. G. currently operates a meat trading business. She purchases meat and other animal products in bulk from herders in the countryside and transports it to Ulaanbaatar, the largest city and capital of Mongolia, where she sells it. G. started her meat trading business in 1995 by selling out of a rented stall at the market in her town. She operated there for 10 years before suffering a major injury that kept her from work for two years. In 2008, using the knowledge, experience and good supplier relationships she had built before her injury, she began transporting meat to UB.

W. lives in the village of Barangay Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is 67 years old and single.\r\n\r\nEven as she is getting on in years, Marilou is still working and doing business to earn a living to support herself and her nephew who is her dependent. She also works hard so that she will have enough savings to support herself and stay independent in her old age.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for her future and to have a stable source of income, Marilou put up a general store adjacent to her house. She sells different kinds of household products for the mothers, and goodies such as candies for the children of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn 2000 Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to help her business expand. From that loan she was able to buy additional products for her general store and was able to put up a new food-vending business. Her good performance and dedication to improve her business was rewarded by her increasing income capacity which, in turn, allows her to borrow bigger loans to sustain her business expansion.\r\n\r\nWhen she was able to borrow a bigger amount, Marilou started raising pigs in her backyard to supplement her income and to have more savings for her future. Her combined business income is PHP 4,000 per month and it helps her support her household and send her nephew to school.\r\n\r\nFor her 13th loan she was able to obtain PHP 16,000 and it was used as working capital. Her loan was repaid on time and in full without any delays in any of the weekly installments. For her next, 14th, loan she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 16,000, again as additional capital for her businesses. The income from this her increased business will be used for her household needs and for the renovation of her store.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":404021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as additional working capital for her businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"La Castellana, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-13T20:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":640},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":640}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84,"local_amount":3840,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3899.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004198,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":2560,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2599.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848969,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3249.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739637,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":2560,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2599.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129057,"comment":null},{"amount":56,"local_amount":2560,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2599.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965855,"comment":null},{"amount":28,"local_amount":1280,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1299.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997769,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-16T21:36:23Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143811,"name":"Darjaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G. is 53 years old and lives with her husband and two sons in the Hovd province of western Mongolia.

S. lives in the village of Brgy. Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is 52 and has two adult children, ages 26 and 28. Her older son graduated from college with a degree in Mass Communication and already has his own family. Her younger son is a trained radio technician. He has not yet found work in his field of study, so he currently earns his living by driving one of two tricycles (a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers) owned by Suzette.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite being separated from her husband, Suzette strives hard to meet her familial obligations, trying to be both mother and father to her sons. Without the additional support of another breadwinner in the family, Suzette has been doing her utmost to continue pursuing her dreams for her children, because she truly believes that her dream will come true. She holds on and trusts that she can succeed through hard work, perseverance, and full faith in the Almighty.\r\n<p>\r\nHer progress out of poverty started in 2003 when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and borrowed PHP 3,000 to start a food vending business. She started out as a sort of one-man band: she both cooked the food and sold it to people in her neighborhood. She began buying bananas in bulk and selling them to her neighbors in retail. Her business activities also helped her adjust to her new single status, and she became more independent and empowered because she knew she had the capacity to provide for her young family.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business continued to improve, she was able to buy a motorized water pump for her house, which in turn allowed her to raise pigs in her backyard without offending her neighbors with the usual foul odor that occurs when a pig-raising business is not maintained well. From her subsequent loans, she was able to buy tricycles for her sons to drive, allowing them to help earn a living for their families. She was also able to buy the rights to a piece of land. Her combined net income from all her business activities eventually amounted to PHP 3,500 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her good credit performance in her group, her center, and NWTF-PD (Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation - Project Dungannon), she was able to secure the amount of Php 19,500 for her thirteenth cycle loan, which she used for her business. The loan was paid in timely weekly installments and was fully paid within its set term. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her fourteenth cycle, she is borrowing Php 25,000 to be used for her business, as well as to pay for motorcycle maintenance, because when the machines are in good condition they are able to generate more income. The profits earned from this loan will be used for the needs of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nSuzette is shown in the picture posing with the two tricycles that are in need of maintenance work.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, the Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She is 45 years old and married to Jun V. who is a tricycle driver and who also helps his wife to run their business. They have two children who are 19 and 21 years old and are still studying. The family lives in the village of Barangay Mabini, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nThe couple strives really hard to provide for the future of their children. Jun drives the tricycle (a motorcycle with a passenger sidecar) that they own to shuttle passengers around town for a fee. Fely started a general store using recycled lumber for its structure just so she could have a place to setup her business. She knew even then that, once the business became stable, she would be able to start repairs and improve the structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two businesses, the couple also wakes up before dawn to buy fish either in the market or in the fishing port and sells it in front of their general store. Fely also started selling coffee and snacks as well as coconut wine adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Fely joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital for their expanding businesses. With more capital, she was able to increase her monthly income to PHP 20,000 on the average, providing their family with a more comfortable living and enabling her to make improvements to her store and house and have some left for savings.\r\n\r\nFely borrowed PHP 29,500 on her previous loan which she used as additional capital in her general store business. She paid all of her weekly installments in full without any delays within her loan term. She now is borrowing the same amount of PHP 29,500 to use as working capital for her business. The income from it will be used to support the family's household needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":403906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as additional working capital for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cadiz, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-13T23:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29500,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1180}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78,"local_amount":3540,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3620.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004200,"comment":null},{"amount":104,"local_amount":4720,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4827.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848971,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":5900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6034.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739639,"comment":null},{"amount":104,"local_amount":4720,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4827.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129059,"comment":null},{"amount":104,"local_amount":4720,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4827.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965857,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":5900,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6034.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997771,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T20:34:24Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143824,"name":"Jesus Love Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesus Love is a group of 5 borrowers which is led by Jennes S.

Her husband works as a timekeeper in Hacienda, which earns him a low monthly salary that barely supports the needs of their family.  Although some of her children are already adults and can fend for themselves, she has younger children (the youngest being just 9 years old) who still depend on her for all their needs. Amalia's ambition in life is to be able to send her children to school and to help her husband support their family. <p>\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she decided to set up a general store.  Fortunately, she had the foresight to build it in an area where there is a steady flow of pedestrian traffic -- right in front of the tricycle terminal.  As time went on, her business steadily improved.  Moreover, she used her business skills to continuously improve and enlarge her product lines, such as by stocking up on fast-selling products for a high inventory turnover rate. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2005, when she realized that she needed fresh capital in order to take her store to the next level, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon.  By doing so, she was able to borrow much-needed capital to continue her business expansion.  And, as she has continued to pay back and borrow new loans, she is happy that her membership with NWTF-PD hsa allowed her to sustain her business momentum.  In fact, her business now earns her a net profit of PHP 3,000, which puts her that much closer to meeting her family's dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 7,500 for her 7th cycle loan, which she used as working capital for her general store.  Notably, she paid her weekly installment payment in full and in a timely manner, without any delays.  For her 8th cycle she is seeking to borrow PHP 15,000 to be used (again) as additional capital.  More specifically, she hopes to maximize her income potential with this loan, especially now that the sugar milling season has started once again, thereby opening a new opportunity to sell more goods to the community. She intends to use the income generated from her business to support her family's needs. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of thousands of women.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shakarmo is a very hardworking and independent woman. She has three kids, two of whom she still supports and who are in elementary and high school, respectively. In search of a way to support her household, she started selling groceries 17 years ago. A true entrepreneur, she studies the market to determine client needs and preferences. Industrious and enterprising, Shakarmo is focused on expanding her business. At the same time with the help of her children Shakarmo raises cattle. In order to grow her business, Shakarmo is requesting a loan of 6400 Somoni ($1475 USD), which she will use to purchase foodstuff to be able to offer a wider selection to her customers and increase her income. With the part of the loan she will also buy young cattle. With the increased sales and profits, Shakarmo hopes to expand her grocery and improve the living standards of her family.

Shakarmo and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.  \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

P. is 7 years older than her husband, Benedicto P., who is now 50 years old. Their children are: Marisol, age 15 and Mary Joy, age 13, both still studying; Elmer, age 32, now married; Melvin, age 30, also married; and Mary Ann, age 22, still single.\r\n\r\nCelerina\u2019s husband has been working continuously as a security guard in Taytay Rizal for fifteen years now and this was the one source of their income. But, because they have more expenses in their house plus the expenses of two children in school, Celerina had to think of another way to augment her husband\u2019s insufficient salary.\r\n\r\nThe solution that Celerina thought of is to start a business that fits their place to produce an extra income. But one of her dilemmas in starting the business was a lack of capital for it. Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) is the one who solved her dilemma.\r\n\r\nCelerina joined ASHI in 2004 and the loan that she received from the institution was used as capital to start the business that she thought of, which is food preparation. Now she wants to again use a loan to improve her business. She wants to buy some necessary things needed in her business like a different bowl where the menu is placed. She also wants to diversify her menu for a much bigger income.\r\n\r\nCelerina does everything to make her business grow more. She exerts more effort with the help of her daughter, Mary Ann. Celerina is the one who will buy the ingredients in the afternoon and cook them the next morning and Mary Ann will sell the food. Celerina really does everything to make her business grow in order for her children, and also her grandchildren, to experience a better

is a proud mother of her 6 children: Michael, aged 38, is now working abroad; Manulito, aged 37, now drives their own tricycle, a type of cab in the Philippines that has 3 wheels; Joseph, aged 35, now works as accounting staff; Verlita, aged 33, now works as teacher in their town; Jessie, aged 27, now works as a consultant in a company; and Bernandita, aged 22, is now studying 3rd year college. Lolita is proud because all of her children have finished their studies, except for Bernandita who is now currently studying. All of them are now married, except Jessie. Of course she is also proud of herself because she really works hard for success and, with the help of her husband who is now 61 years old, 3 years older than her. He has been working as a Baranggay Official in their town for 4 years now. His salary is one of their sources of income. Aside from the salary of her husband, the revenue of the tricycle that her son drives aids also to support them.\r\n\r\nWhen Lolita joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) she used the loan to buy rice for her buying and selling of rice business. Following the success of that business, she invested in the charcoal business. This is Lolita\u2019s 9th cycle loan. She will use the funds to support both of these businesses. She will buy sacks of rice and supplies for the charcoal business. The charcoal business has been affected by typhoon \u201cOndoy\u201d. If Lolita makes her own charcoal, she will increase her income.\r\n\r\nLolita\u2019s dream now is to make her business grow so that they can build a much bigger and better house. Also, she dreams for her youngest child to finish her studies so that she can help herself and her family improve their life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":405028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is a 46 year old man who lives in Tripoli, northern Lebanon. Gerjes has been selling bread in his car. He sells to grocers stores, to other shops and he also sells in villages. He requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to do some maintenance work on his car. This is his second cycle and he has always paid on time. \nHis previous loan helped him improve his work. Gerjes is special in his work because he knows how to treat his clients; since he sees them a lot, they became friends. His clients are his friends, neighbors and shops.

The team leader, Ilse Lourdes, has a restaurant and sells fried chicken. The members elected her as their leader because of her enthusiasm and responsibility. The women have different businesses selling different things, including: clothing for men and women, underwear, groceries, and food. Some are fixed stores and others are street vendors. There is competition with other businesses, but the women have loyal customers who buy from them constantly. In the event that they have difficulty with their businesses the women diversify and have other sources of income. Some of them have begun to work part-time with a fixed wage. \r\n<p>\r\nThe members want to take advantage of AVON, EBEL, \u00c9SIKA's offer and purchase more clothing and consumables (rice, pasta).

Her business is also located in her home.\n\nRosa has shown herself to be a reliable Esperanza client by completing one loan cycle with out problems. She is excited to take her next loan and with it she plans to invest in her business by purchasing a hair dryer, curling iron and hair products to sell in her store. She believes this will improve her profits and with those profits she plans to purchase school supplies for her children and hopefully a computer so that they will be able to learn about technology.

For the past 11 years she has been a pork butcher, and she also makes steamed corn cakes called nacatamales. In the beginning she started out after she managed with a great deal of effort to save enough money to buy two piglets. Later she butchered them and earned a small profit.

The city is characterized by its colonial churches, the beauty that the city contains, being considered the Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and all the tourist sights that it offers to national and foreign tourists.  The communal bank is formed by a group of happy members who are united, collaborative, and have been working with the institution for various years.  Alejandrina Laura Z. Guti\u00e9rrez, who lives in downtown Cuenca, is 31 years old, and has three chilren ages 12, 11, and 10.  Her husband is a salesman and they maintain a good relationship with each other and with their children.  Alejandrina works as a beauty product representative for Yanbal, and also sells casual and intimate clothing for women, men, and children by catalogue.  She has been doing this for seven years and believes it is going very well, but now her sales have decreased slightly because school has started.  Her job requires significant effort and dedication, so she goes door to door to make her sales, spending a lot of time out of the house and hardly spends time with her children.  One benefit is the strong reception that her products receive in the market.  Alejandrina has a good relationship with all the group members, and is also one of the most cheerful.

He worked for 5 years in Argentina, and with his small savings he returned to Paraguay to set up a small business selling honey. With the support of his wife who helps selling the product, they hope to generate revenue. He is very grateful for the business because they now have their own home and a vehicle, which makes it easier to distribute honey to different parts in the city. \r\nThey are very happy with their jobs because of the earnings they have made. The income gives them economic stability for their entire family. This time, he is applying for a loan to buy more honey, to make honey cakes and sweets.

During her first year, she made a half dozen gowns that she sold at the market in Masaya.   In 2007, after a year in business, she began working with ADIM.  The assistance she received helped her increase her business to the point where she currently distributes her clothing line in Managua, Catarina, Masaya, Granada, Le\u00f3n, and Jinotepe.\r\n<p>\r\nLucrecia says that she was able to get ahead thanks to the favorable loans from ADIM and the hard work of her family, which includes her four children and her husband who provided assistance.  During this time, she opened her own establishment in a location that overlooks the large tourist city of Catarina.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a role model of perseverance, hard work, and the desire for self-improvement.  Like a grain of sand, only a tiny bit of self-belief is all that is needed to realize one\u2019s goals.

Each has received loans previously and as a result has seen their respective businesses grow.\n\nMar\u00eda will use this loan to purchase used clothing for her resale shop, the loan allows her to buy in bulk and therefore receive a better price.

The loan will also improve her house, she says, since she lives behind the shop. The loan will pay for an awning to provide shade for her business. Since Nicaragua is extremely hot, she considers this a very important investment. \n\nHer business has grown considerably since she started getting loans from CEPRODEL, though business has been slow during the current economic crisis. Taxis are her biggest customer. Many people buy parts for their personal cars and motorcycles here as well. According to Maritza her loans have had a very positive effect on her life over time since very slowly, piece by piece, she can improve the living conditions in her house. \n\nMaritza has one daughter who is married and no longer lives at home.

The difficult economic situation across the country in those times maD. it so that many companies went bankrupt leaving many unemployed. When Maria became unemployed she offered her services to a woman who maD. clothing in a market; she tells us that she was treated very poorly and paid little, but due to the poor economic situation that she was facing she had to continue with this work despite the fact that she felt exploited. \r\n<P>\r\nDespite the bad situation, it allowed her to become well known and little by little she began taking clients to her house, and working on her own account; she only had one sewing machine and a few other items, but her ingenuity and experience didn\u2019t allow her to give up. She remembers that this was a hard time in her life, many people didn\u2019t pick up their garments and others didn\u2019t pay for the work that she done, regardless, she continued without giving up. Sadly, her husband passed away and now she finds herself confronting an even more difficult situation, however, knowing her children\u2019s needs has impelled her to continue and to work without giving up. Currently Maria has 3 sewing machines, 2 of which are semi industrial and 1 is a specialty sewing machine. She has many clients and she finds what she has been able to accomplish incredible. Her biggest incentive has been her son that very much depends on her; he has hemiplegia and she works for him without rest. On the other hand, she has also been able to move forward in the construction of her house. In addition to this, she also works in anything she can find; sometimes she makes small pieces of jewelry, handicrafts, etc. \r\n<P>\r\nIn the future she would like to set up a shop to make and sell clothing and rent costumes in her own house. This loan being granted to her by EDAPROSPO will help her to purchase more fabrics to offer her clients. She knows that her business will continue growing, and that she will accomplish whatever she aspires to. \r\n<P>\r\n*Maria is seated in the middle (in the above photo). \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":405437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase fabrics to make clothing.

Ofelia G. has been dreaming of a better future for her seven children who range in age from four to 13 years old. She wants to build a better house for them and be able to sustain their education until they graduate from college. However, depending on her husband\u2019s sporadic and small income being a farm laborer and a fisherman, her dream would be out of reach. That realization led her to ASHI. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, along with the aspiration she had in her heart and mind, G. joined ASHI and requested a loan to start her own hog fattening (pig raising) business and to support her husband\u2019s fishing business. Proceeds she had then have enabled her to pay back on time the total amount she had borrowed. Now ASHI and its partners trust her even with a larger loan. Most importantly, she has started a business, which will be a great source for financial assistance in reaching her dream. Now, with a much larger loan, she will be growing her business and her husband\u2019s

Having been living under the umbrella of poverty since birth until she has her own family, Adelaida believed that her patience and industry in running a business through the opportunity to access credit will change the lives of her children. Therefore, in 2009 Adelaida joined ASHI and used the loan she had received to raise hog\/pig. After four months of raising or fattening, pig will be sold either alive or slaughtered for its meat to be sold per kilo. Out of her loan then, she was able also to support her husband\u2019s fishing business. The thought of her five children especially those three who were elementary and high school undergraduate in addition to her youngest two who were still studying in elementary and high school, gives her courage to request for a larger amount of loan and be willing to take risk in growing a business. Adelaida said that without her loan, supporting the financial requirement of her business to expand and increase the profit would be impossible.

T. is from the village of Poblacion Ramon Magsaysay, Zamboanga del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to customers, and different products to sell in the local community. Luzel has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Luzel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to expand the business. Luzel is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase foods & drinks for the mini restaurant. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Luzel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She is a woman who has worked hard throughout her life in order to get ahead.  Irene lives in her own home and hopes to have a peaceful retirement.  She manages a grocery store in one of the more crowded areas of her neighborhood.  Her charismatic and kind personality makes her popular amongst her neighbors, who do not hesitate to shop early because her store is one of the first to open.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her job is talking with her customers about events that occur in the neighborhood. Irene has been in business for 20 years and says the most difficult part is spending all day inside her store, yet she knows that she has to continually attend to customers if she does not want sales to decline.

She lives in her own home with her family, and she would love to improve her quality of life. Her business is located in the San Jos\u00e9 market - a very important market in the city of Juliaca - where she sells heaters, radios, pots and pans, watches, etc. - anything one could use in a home. Her stall is very popular, as she provides great customer service. What Isolina loves most about her business is talking to the ladies in the neighboring stalls. She has been in this business for 17 years; she thinks transporting the products from the city of Desaguadero (district of Puno, in the border with Bolivia) to her stall is the most difficult task of all and leaves her very tired. In the future, she would like to have a larger store from which to sell her products more easily. This is Isolina's sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP; she is determined to pay all her installments timely. In her communal bank, she is one of the most responsible and reliable members. With the PEN 1,500 she is requesting, she will buy more products to better her stall. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":405517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-14T06:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997669,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":252.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843021,"comment":null},{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734597,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives in her own home with her family, and what she wishes most is to be successful in life. Leocadia sells bedspreads; her business operates mostly in the street markets of the city of Juliaca, but she also sells her products in the cities of Puno, Ayaviri, Azangaro, and Huancan\u00e9. Very popular with her customers, her bedspreads are of good quality and they last a long time. On the days when street markets are not in operation, Leocadia makes the most of her time by doing house work. She has been in this business for 12 years and thinks the most difficult part is transporting her products to the selling points. In the future, she would love to have a large store to sell her bedspreads specifically.

This inspiring quotation is shared by Mrs. Corazon P., the responsible housewife of Mr. Leon Penticostes.

Both of them are now in secondary education and have the ambition of being successful someday in their chosen professions.\r\n\r\nAs parents, Mr. and Mrs. P. have the responsibility of supporting the education of their children. Despite hardships and difficulties they are striving to earn a living. They cultivate their farm lots by planting rice, vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Mrs. Corazon put-up a small sari-sari store (variety store) in their village to earn additional income. She started this with little capital amounting to PHP 4,000. As a fruit of her patience and sacrifices, she is able to earn a net income of PHP 6,000 which they use to satisfy their needs and finance the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nSince her business is profitable, Mrs. Corazon wants to improve it by acquiring additional products to sell. Thus, she wants to use a loan of PHP 5,000 from the microfinance organization as additional capital for acquiring these products. She believes that, with proper management of her capital, she will be able to improve her small sari-sari store and earn a higher income to support the education of their two children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":404773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Th\u1ecb (51) is a 35 year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Loan is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 9 Nam Ngan (08.1.9 Nam Ngan).\n\n\nLoan is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, Loan owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community.  Loan has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1500000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2009, Loan joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Loan is requesting for the first time a loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.    She is now requesting a new loan of 3000000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Loan plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.  N.

He's married with 4 children. Over the years, Kobilbobo has become very knowledgeable about what is required to raise cattle, their feeding, their calving, etc. It should be noted that, in the past, this man endured hard economic times for a while but he's managed to come through thanks to the help provided by IMON International. IMON International has granted loans that Kobilbobo has used to buy calves, the reason, too, that he needs this loan now. The loan will greatly improve Kobilbobo\u2019s income and his family's living standards. \n\n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 44 years old, is married and the mother of four children aged 28, 24, 22 and 14 years.  The two youngest go to school.  Her husband works in RSA (Republic of South Africa) and, from time to time, sends money to help support the family.  Maria finished fourth grade and stopped studying when she set up her own household.  She lives in her own house and, apart from her children, is not responsible for supporting anyone. \r\n\r\nShe left Xai-xai 29 years ago, after her marriage.  Due to some difficulties that she encountered, she chose to begin her own business more than 24 years ago.  She sells mostly capulanas (lengths of brightly-coloured cloth used as skirts, wraps, headdresses, etc.) which she buys for 620 MT apiece and sells for 800 MT.  At the end of every month this brings in approximately 8,000 MT, from which she manages to put some aside in one of the commercial banks of Mozambique (Millenium Bim).\r\n\r\nShe has already had business loans from the micro Bank Tchuma.  She stopped raising money there when a neighbour advised her that Hluvuku offered better opportunities in credit limits.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema in the amount of 10,000 MT for purchasing more capulanas to increase the volume of her business.  The last loan was for the same amount and purpose.\r\n\r\nShe intends to repay the loan without any problem, in order to be able to access more loans to improve and construct a conventional business establishment to satisfy her customers and bring in more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":371.21,"image":{"id":405729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase and sale of capulanas (women's clothing) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-16T18:10:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.79,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria  Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.49},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.47},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.65},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.05,"local_amount":1547.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1625.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816808,"comment":null},{"amount":59.24,"local_amount":1579.71,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1658.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708991,"comment":null},{"amount":63.74,"local_amount":1699.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1784.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938058,"comment":null},{"amount":66.25,"local_amount":1766.65,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-29T10:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1854.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938059,"comment":null},{"amount":65.87,"local_amount":1840.39,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"payment_id":128971991,"comment":null},{"amount":58.06,"local_amount":1565.61,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1643.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.65,"payment_id":136698584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T00:17:14Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":144164,"name":"Beauty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beauty, 32 years old and single, has a salon where she sells hair cream and hair extensions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 41 years old and a single mother of a 13 year old girl who attends 9th grade at the Zedequias Manganhela secondary school.  \r\n\r\nShe lives with her daughter in a home she owns in Khongolote, a suburban area outside of the city of Maputo.  She does not support anyone else.  She attended school until 7th grade in the old system, but was unable to continue due to her parents' financial difficulties.  \r\n\r\nShe left Zavala for Maputo at the invitation of her oldest brother.  She has been a domestic worker without a fixed contract for more than 6 years, working around 10 hours per day.  She learned to do this work from her sisters, when she was young.  She earns 2.000.00 MT per month and saves a bit through the traditional savings system (Xitique).  \r\n\r\nShe has never requested a loan from any other lending institution.  This is her third loan with Hluvuku, for the amount of 10.000.00 MT which she will use to purchase cement, sand, labor, etc.  Her previous loans were for 10.000.00 MT and 15.000.00 MT, both for the same purpose.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she plans to make improvements to her home, even with the problem of the high cost of construction materials.  In the future she plans to request additional loans to purchase consumer goods and to finish construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":365.86,"image":{"id":405743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of cement, sand, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-18T21:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.14,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valdemira Gaspar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.03},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.12,"local_amount":616.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":647.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816813,"comment":null},{"amount":17.38,"local_amount":463.36,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":486.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708996,"comment":null},{"amount":12.73,"local_amount":339.54,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":356.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101576,"comment":null},{"amount":14.69,"local_amount":391.63,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":411.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938065,"comment":null},{"amount":23.14,"local_amount":617.03,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":647.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938066,"comment":null},{"amount":24.25,"local_amount":677.66,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.16,"payment_id":128971996,"comment":null},{"amount":25.88,"local_amount":697.77,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":732.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":136698588,"comment":null},{"amount":224.67,"local_amount":6196.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6506.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.69,"payment_id":151916020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-19T03:49:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":144176,"name":"Ismoil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. Ismoil is 26 years old. He is married with three children. Since he was a very young he has been in the business of raising and selling cattle which is why he has a lot of experience. It is necessary to point out that he has been able to succeed thanks to the support provided by IMON International. This support has been in the form of a loan which he has used to purchase and raise young bulls in their locality. Today, Ismoil has once again come to IMON International for a loan which will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell. It is his biggest dream to improve the conditions of his business in order to then improve the conditions of his family.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The group is comprised of 13 members with low incomes.  They are very hard-working and have the expectation of achieving more income.  The women have had a friendship for a long time; they know each other through their businesses and as neighbors.  \r\n\r\nThey work in different types of commercial activities like a grocery store, selling bread, cakes, cell phones, shoes, cosmetics, and making articles of clothing.  Some have fixed stands and others are street vendors.  If they have competitors, the members have the ability to move their stands and to diversity their merchandise to be able to get a daily income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise, supplies, and tools to help them improve their daily income.  For example, getting an electric sewing machine would really help Silvie to deliver her work more quickly.  This would improve her daily income to support her children.  She would be able to give them everything she always dreamed about, a better education and a better future for the whole family.\r\n\r\nAs far as their loan experience goes, the members are in their fourth cycle.  They show a great desire to keep growing, honesty, and responsibility in their payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He has a farm where he grows crops as well as producing milk from his dairy cows. For eighteen years now he has been working on the farm, which is located in the town of Sorata, in the Vinto Province of Cochabamba Department. He has been working in agriculture since he was a child helping on his parents' farm.\r\n\r\nFreddy plans on using the loan from CIDRE to buy fertilizer as well as seeds for growing potatoes, corn, and parsley. He begins his work before dawn each morning, because he needs to collect the parsley so it can be taken to be sold at the markets in town. This way, he can sell to customers who come to the market in the morning looking for fresh herbs.\r\n\r\nFreddy hopes the loan will help him to increase his earnings so that he can build a better home for his family, as the one they live in now is simple and small. He also hopes to continue taking care of his elderly mother, whose health has been deteriorating. While Freddy never finished high school, he does not believe that has impeded the growth of his business. But more than anything, however, he wants to ensure he has enough money saved to fund the entire education of his two daughters.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":933.24,"image":{"id":405856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

G. es un se\u00f1or de 39 a\u00f1os de edad. Vive en una casa propia con su esposa y sus dos hijas. Su familia se ha dedicado desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la ganader\u00eda tanto para leche como para carne. \u00c9l sigui\u00f3 los mismos pasos y actualmente tiene una finca que es la que le ayuda a salir adelante. \n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don Juan Carlos se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os don Juan Carlos ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \n\nDon Juan Carlos desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s.\n\nActualmente don Juan Carlos orde\u00f1a a mano en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 40 litros de leche y con una vaca m\u00e1s su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00eda a 60 litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionado de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\n\nDon Juan Carlos es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya un  microcr\u00e9dito y lo ha cancelado satisfactoriamente ayud\u00e1ndole a crecer en su negocio de producci\u00f3n de leche y sus derivados.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":405871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de
