O. lives in the department of Usulut\u00e1n with her 15-year old daughter who is a student. Gloria owns a business selling cosmetics, hair and nail accessories, combs, nail polish etc. Although all her clients are women, Gloria makes a good living and has already had her business for twenty years. She is able to provide her daughter with all the basics and also pay for household expenses. \r\n\r\nNow she would like to expand her inventory, especially for the month of February when sales increase, and then later in the month of April, when the summer holidays begin.

S. has a general store in which she sells a little bit of everything, located in the Santa Ana neighborhood, next to the Walter Penki bridge. Se\u00f1ora M. needs financing to buy merchandise for her store, since she has almost no stock. She opens her business from 6 in the morning until 9 at night every day. She is a single mother. She has no dependents now. But she is a woman who likes to work hard and not depend on anyone. She has a regular job, which is to sweep the streets in part of the town in the early morning hours. Then, on arriving at her house, she opens her store. Her business began 12 years ago when she began selling fruit at the door of her house in order to advance her children. Then she increased her stock for sale up to the point that it became a store. She has worked with us for about 5 years, with 28 loans, which have benefited her enough that she has been able to remodel her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

She works as a tailor from her house, where she makes pants, dresses and shirts. She started this business nine years ago. She was taught to sew by her mother, but she never thought she would work in this activity some day. She started her business as an alternative source of income that would provide additional income from that of her husband, to bring them financial stability. Over time she has gained many customers, who ask for her a lot since they know she works well and doesn't charge too much. Her loan will be invested in purchasing a variety of fabric to make clothing. She has always dreamed of some day having an industrial shop that can give work to other people and to have more income than she already earns.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

from a family of musicians, Anne always knew she'd become a professional musician. She studied jazz at an East Coast music school and became a singer, pianist, and songwriter.\r\n\r\nInspired to action by 9\/11, Anne did her first demo recording soon after. She then took the most popular track from her initial demo and used it as the base for her latest project, a full-length CD.\r\n\r\nWhile her bank wouldn't finance a musical endeavor, the loan officer who reviewed Anne's loan application referred her to ACCION USA. Compared to the credit cards Anne used to start her project, she's relieved to have a low interest ACCION USA loan. Now Anne can concentrate on promoting her work!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5475,"image":{"id":493749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

city.  This school was established in 1996. Currently, the school has 14 staff members. Out of the 14, eight have applied for a loan of SLL 5,600,000 from SMT\/Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT.  School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

This bank is in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador\u2019s third most important.  Cuenca is located in the south-central part of the country and its climate is cold, which permits its inhabitants to farm various fruits and vegetables both for the local market and for the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nTo be part of the communal bank was a great help to our member, Dellys V., because of the loans received that helped her to stabilize economically.  This was thanks to her friend who, as another member of the bank, invited her to become a member.  She is a member that enchants other with her charisma and kindness.  She lives in Cuenca\u2019s outskirts, along V\u00eda a Nulti, with her life partner and their only, 14-year-old daughter.  Her husband has his own machine shop that is located in their home, thus saving on rental costs.\r\n\r\nDellys is a clothing and footwear merchant; she has been in this line of work for several years.  She goes to all the city\u2019s neighborhoods from Monday through Friday but especially on holidays.  Thanks to her work, she has many acquaintances and regular customers to whom she sells her merchandise on credit.\r\n\r\nShe relates to us that she has worked with communal bank loans for two years now.  She will use the funds requested on this occasion to buy pants, shirts, coats, blouses, sports and casual shoes for women, men and children so that she can have a varied stock available for her demanding customers, thereby increasing her business.\r\n\r\n Her goal is to finish building her house because it\u2019s still lacking a few finishing touches.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She runs her business out of her home, and works primarily on public relations in the Caribbean. On occasion, Felicia also writes for a daily newspaper in New York.\r\n\r\nThe turning point in her business was being contacted by an India-based company to do their ad placements in the Caribbean, Africa, and Latin America. She has successfully serviced their account for several years. In addition, she has recently been inundated with all the newswire hits on Haiti.\r\n\r\nFelicia contacted ACCION USA to provide her with the funds needed to hire a new staff member. She hit some struggles with her business during the economic downturn in 2008, but since then she has been doing her best to build her business. Her current staff of part- and full-time employees needs to be expanded to continue to successfully grow her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7001.25,"image":{"id":494547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

M. lives in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She is married with 4 children, all over 40 years of age and she lives with her husband, a son and 3 grandchildren.  She has a business where she makes layettes and needs a loan of $2.000.000 (pesos), that she will use to buy fabrics, materials and decorations to make clothing and items for babies. \r\n<p>Emilce is a long-term customer with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation (Kiva\u2019s field partner) that started its business some 20 years ago because a friend recommended her to be a part of this organization in a group loan.  There they lent her $15.000 (pesos), for the first time and that is how she bought her first fabrics and developed her business from that moment.  While she was in the group loan, they helped each other mutually but now she has an individual loan.  Throughout the years with the foundation, her business has consisted of selling layettes, sheets, awnings, decorations for baskets, as well as fried food.  Now she is more into making baby clothing and a big part of her customers are pregnant women but she also has others that exhibit the products she makes in their businesses.\r\n<p>Through her business, she has been able to rent a room where they sell cell-phone minutes, a barbershop and an apartment that is rented and all are part of her current income.  She says that she chooses her tenants very carefully and now dreams of having her own apartment to have a personal space for her at the end of her life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She has studied and received a qualification in the area of banking and finance, and she has worked in various companies in search of a better income. For the past ten years, she has worked in a cooperative called Dos de Agosto (August 2) as general accountant. Thus, thanks to the Lord, she has a house that is built completely from concrete, and she has been able to add to her savings. However, she still needs to plaster the walls, add ceramic tiles to the porch, paint, and tile a part of the patio, since in winter there is a lot of mud which attracts mosquitoes. She would like to renovate her house in order to improve its condition and provide better hygiene. For this reason, she chose to request financing, because everything is expensive and she has not been able to make progress. With this loan, she will be able to finish everything.

Since he was 13 years old, he has demonstrated an inclination for the visual arts \u2013 creating works made of clay, wood, and ceramics.  By the time he was 16, he started painting abstract designs and female figures in oil and acrylic.  What is true about Germ\u00e1n is that he knows perfect sculpturing techniques and has a wonderful eye for expressing abstract forms in his creations.  They are pure, yet cannot be identified through existing images.  Each creation is guided by the imagination and fantasy of the artist\u2019s spirit.  Although his experience has been mostly self-taught, Germ\u00e1n has received basic preparatory training in visual art in which he learned drawing, abstract sculpture, and three-dimensional shapes.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Germ\u00e1n has a studio dedicated to sculptures made of wood and stone, as well as his artistic paintings.  He also produces and sells handicrafts such as lamps made of wood, parchment, and leather.

She sells notebooks, jewelry, gifts, postcards, etc. One of the challenges she faces is the crime in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nCecilia wants to purchase notebooks, pens, and soft drinks for her customers with the loan. In the future, she hopes to open another stationary shop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by David Kaisel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":494701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase notebooks, pens and drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-02-24T05:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":54.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61.72},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.79},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.72},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.79},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.77},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.27},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.95,"local_amount":54.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":54.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674107,"comment":null},{"amount":61.72,"local_amount":61.72,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":61.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708265,"comment":null},{"amount":62.84,"local_amount":62.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":62.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891463,"comment":null},{"amount":64.79,"local_amount":64.79,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631717,"comment":null},{"amount":66.09,"local_amount":66.09,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":66.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845601,"comment":null},{"amount":67.61,"local_amount":67.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":67.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111887,"comment":null},{"amount":69.84,"local_amount":69.84,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":69.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405297,"comment":null},{"amount":71.27,"local_amount":71.27,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543787,"comment":null},{"amount":80.89,"local_amount":80.89,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T05:51:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179487,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio de somotillo, comarca la pavana, el se\u00f1or Mario G.

In a good month, Elizabeth expects to earn 2,000,000 colons, in a bad month, only 1,500,000.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the success the restaurant has enjoyed, Elizabeth has been able to hire three employees. In this way, she has independently created work for herself and others in her community. Elizabeth says that a challenge in running her business has been coping with thieves.\r\n\r\nElizabeth prepares food for school children, but she also sells candies. She plans to use this loan to make general investments in restaurant inventory which will help her to offer high quality products to her clients.\r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to be able to earn enough money one day to purchase a house for her children. Elizabeth also aspires to be the owner of a restaurant; presently she rents the space the restaurant occupies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":494721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To

Reina owns a tortilla shop, which is located in her own home.  She has been in this business for some time, due to the fact that she is a single mother and her mother has a serious illness.  This is why Reina must work very hard to continue progressing and trying to help her tortilla business grow, as it is the only source of income that she has.  Reina requested a loan from Integral with the hope of being able to improve her business conditions.  With this loan, she will purchase more corn and with purchasing it at wholesale price, it will be at a lower price.  This will be of great benefit to her, as it will help her meet higher demand and provide her with higher earnings.

worked as a welder for several years before he was able to save the money necessary to start his own auto repair business. Originally a mechanic in Guatemala, Eddy was finally able to return to his preferred profession in 2008 when he opened the automotive shop with two friends.\n\nIt has not been an easy process \u2013 not long after opening, the economic crisis hit and Eddy and his partners often had conflicting ideas about how to best run the business. As Eddy found himself handling most of the mechanic work and finances on his own, he decided to buy out his friends and run the shop on his own. \u201cIt was a challenge to grow the business on my own, and to make sure that everything got done and my workers got paid. But now the business is sustainable and it\u2019s growing!\u201d\n\nThanks to Eddy\u2019s solid skills as a mechanic and excellent rapport with his customers, his business growth has so far been sustained largely through referrals from existing clients. A $6,000 loan will allow Eddy to expand his inventory of auto parts to serve his clients better and faster, to invest in more marketing efforts to continue to grow business, and to hire a second full-time employee to help manage the growing workload.\n\nIn another year and a half Eddie would like to open another shop, and he says his dream is, \u201cto own an auto chain like Speedy!\u201d\n\nAlthough the recession has affected business, Eddy is optimistic about the future and is proud to be able to provide for his family. Of his children, he says, \u201cIf they want to be mechanics and work in the shop it is here for them, but for now it is important that they study. I want them to be able to be whatever they want.\u201d

Bit by bit, he has been able to expand his office's capacity for dental service, but in spite of all his efforts,he still has not been able to obtain many of the tools that he needs to offer a full range of high quality dental services.  Today, he sees cause for hope in the loan he requests, since the money he obtains would finally enable him to fully equip his dental practice.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Mirasol has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. She used her previous loan to purchase additional products to sell. Mirasol is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be Mirasol's fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

A. lives in the Cusules de Soledad neighborhood.  She and her husband, who have three children that range in ages from 7 to 16 years, are ladies shoes manufacturers.  She started the business after a State-run entity had a course on shoe modelling where she learned this skill.  Later, she was able to gather seed money that she used to buy a machine and tools to make her first shoes.  After that, she hired an employee to increase production and he trained her husband, who became proficient in this work.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; it is valued at $1,000.000 and will be used to buy raw materials and supplies like: sandals, heels, synthetic materials, soles, etc. to make ladies shoes.  She sells to merchants by the dozen and to individuals, who order the style of shoe they want made from a catalogue, by the unit.\r\n\r\nHer most important challenge is competition because she says that the market is saturated with low-price footwear.

They live in Ciudadela Metropolitana, a neighborhood located in Soledad \u2013Atl\u00e1ntico.\r\n\r\nNancy wanted to feel independent and she started her own business. She took advantage of her husband's knowledge (at her side) in welding and her natural managing ability. She responded to her wish to be trained in launching and managing businesses and she prepared beforehand before starting the \u201cTaller de Herrer\u00eda y Ornamentaci\u00f3n Stefany\u201d. Today it is the basis of the family income and the place where the couple express their skills and aptitudes to benefit their family.  Together they have obtained contracts with businesses, educational centers, and contruction which is their main market. They haven't left the individual jobs behind that they do with family, neighbors, and people who know the quality of their work in their workshop.  \r\n\r\nThey still remember when they started with one welding machine making small metalic boxes to protect natural gas meters. For a time it was the only thing they made in their workshop. Gradually, they added other products such as bars, chairs, windows, doors and antennas. This is the second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. They need  $ 2.000.000  to purchase materials such as tubes, irons, paint, soldering, and to make skeletons of spinning chairs and doors ordered by an educational organization with which they regularly do business. Their blacksmith and ornamentation workshop has allowed them to purcahse their house and outfit their workshop in a spacious room which improved their infrastructure in a short time. Competence is a challenge and that is why they always listen to the client and they try to participate in training activities to improve the quality at a management and technical level.     \r\n

She is 28 years old. Rowena is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRowena is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rowena owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general clothing services to local community members. Rowena is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rowena joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rowena is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rowena from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The previous loans she received from ASHI were carefully invested in her variety store. Since then, the business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Nenita needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit making.\r\n\r\nShe runs a variety store. She started her variety store through her initiative of dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business. She is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to use for additional capital to improve her business and her income. Specifically, the money will use to purchase five sacks of rice, charcoal, sugar, canned goods, cigarettes, fabric conditioner, and other inventory for her variety store. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to another village. Her seven children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy with the service of ASHI and KIVA. It gives them a big chance to pursue their family dreams. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of the Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the

Y. is 29 years old. He is married and has the business of baking \u201clepeshka,\u201d the national bread. Hikoyatullo is the main breadwinner in the family. He believes that this business is profitable and is not subject to seasonality. He gets up early and bakes the lepeshka and bread so that people have fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. \r\n\r\nAll the input materials like the flour, salt and yeast, he purchases in the local market. Now due to high demand, Hikoyatullo wants to increase the number of breads he can make, so he requests 4700 Somoni. The loan will be spent on flour and on coal for baking the \u201clepeshka.\u201d\r\n\r\nHikoyatullo deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They get their supplies principally from local producers and wholesalers and they sell their goods in Noukoula and on the market in Konobougou, for cash and on credit, to a customer base made up of both women and men. \r\n\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 17,000 FCFA each, which will be used to boost their working capital and to cover expenses relating to food, their children's schooling and health.\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":495190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of various articles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atoumata        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kotine                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87775.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021689,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87775.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746487,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":87775.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779027,"comment":null},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87775.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961231,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T23:02:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":179776,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson is 60 years old and married with six grown children, who are between the ages of 18 and 30.

He lives with his father in the Darsalam I district of the Koutiala prefecture (in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nMr. S. was forced by the death of his older brother, who helped his father manage their pharmacy, to abandon his training.  He replaced his deceased brother at the pharmacy.   Medicine is one of the primary needs in our underdeveloped nation; he is very much in demand and his reputation is without equal in Koutiala.\r\nIn order to increase his pharmaceutical stocks, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, through which he is requesting his first individual loan.\r\nMr. S. plans to buy various pharmaceutical products (medicines) with this loan.  He gets his supplies from approved agents in Bamako, the capital of Mali.  He sells medicine everyday at the pharmacy located in the main market of Koutiala, to a clientele of men and women who generally pay in cash. \r\nHe plans to clear a monthly profit of 200,000 FCFA which he plans to use to repay the loan, and to use the rest to buy food and invest in his business.  His goal is to seek more substantial financing which will allow him to not only improve his business and therefore his turnover, but also his quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her cowife and their children in the neighborhood of Hamdallaye in the prefecture of Koutiala (region of Sikasso).\r\n\r\nSocial reasons prevented her from continuing her studies. She took very early an interest in income generating activities with her mother. She enjoyed a 6-year-long learning experience which showed her several activities, and in the end she opted for buying and selling fabrics and shoes.\r\n\r\nTo meet the demand of her customers, both in terms of quantity and quality, Sanata decided a year ago to turn to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is her second individual loan. She repaid her first loan on schedule. She wants to use this loan to buy 10 embroidered suits, 5 lengths of wax pagnes (brightly colored African print cloth) and 20 pairs of shoes.\r\n\r\nSanata gets her supplies in Lom\u00e9, the capital of the Republic of Togo, and sells them, for cash or credit, in the city of Koutiala, both hawking and from home, to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n\r\nSanata expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 CFA francs which she will use to pay the interests of her loan and help to provide for the daily needs of the family, as well as reinvest in other income generating activities.\r\n<br

However, he is also running a trading place in the central local market where he sells lepeshka (the national bread). Now Akram is requesting $1375 to purchase flour wholesale for his business. Akram is grateful for all supporting him and promises to manage the loan with accuracy.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
