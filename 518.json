With these two activities, they are trying to raise their family and make progress.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to enlarge her business by acquiring more fish, so that she can increase her sales and have better earnings. For this reason, she believed it would be convenient to apply to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 PEN.\r\n\r\nShe has already had a loan financed by Kiva through Edpyme Alternativa and its product Capital Semilla (Seed Capital). With that opportunity she was also able to acquire more fresh fish to process, and thanks to this investment her business grew, and with her earnings she was able to complete some improvements in their home. She is happy with and quite grateful to the Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":670881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Enlarge her business by acquiring more fish, so that she can increase her sales and receive greater earnings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T04:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":137.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":144.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":143.3},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":160.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":163.74},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":179.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":185.23},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":191.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":195.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.36},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":137.62,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":140.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188667192,"comment":null},{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":144.23,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":147.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410518,"comment":null},{"amount":51.95,"local_amount":143.3,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":146.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108943,"comment":null},{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":156.92,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":159.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201271097,"comment":null},{"amount":58.04,"local_amount":160.11,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":163.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210202,"comment":null},{"amount":183.35,"local_amount":505.8,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":515.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488510,"comment":null},{"amount":64.98,"local_amount":179.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":182.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181481,"comment":null},{"amount":67.15,"local_amount":185.23,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":188.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232778542,"comment":null},{"amount":140.48,"local_amount":387.54,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":395.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583184,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-20T12:57:32Z","paid_date":"2011-11-19T08:56:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":259558,"name":"Kung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kung O. lives in Tuol Trea village, Takeo province and she is 55 years old.

This loan will be very helpful in growing her business, so that her four children can fulfill their dreams of completing college and finding stable jobs.\r\n\r\nJenny runs her business to generate income to financially support her family. She would like to increase her weekly income. For this purpose, she applied for a new loan of 40,000 Php to purchase more stocks of firewood and to increase her working capital. Firewood, like charcoal, is the most common means of cooking food for poor people living in very remote areas of the province. Aside from its affordable price, firewood is also the most conveniently accessible commodity for everyone in distant villages. \r\n\r\nMost people in the villages cannot afford to buy a gas stove and gas to cook for their food.  Instead, they use firewood or charcoal as an alternative to a gas stove since it\u2019s very expensive. \r\n\r\nJenny has taken out many loans from ASHI and has repaid them successfully.  Therefore, she is trusted with much larger loans. Because of her 100% credit rating (on the basis of past loans) Jenny is also eligible for incentive loans for home repairs and education. These incentive loans are made only to very good members of ASHI, like Jenny. \r\n\r\nAs active entrepreneur, Jenny would also like to explore additional businesses to provide her family a good living. Through business success, Jenny would like to invest in their own land to build a comfortable home to live in. \r\n\r\nBeing a loyal member of ASHI for almost 5 years, Jenny wants to stay in ASHI for a long time because the institution is her second family.  It gave her and her family hope to start dreaming for a better life, out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe is very pleased to be a Kiva borrower, and says thank you to Kiva lenders for helping fund her business dreams. She prays that they will be blessed.

She is 23 years old. Josephine is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJosephine is married and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Josephine owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chicken for sale. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Josephine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is mother devoted to her only child, Rhodges. She is married to her loving spouse, Roy M., a welder, and lives on beautiful Talim Island in Binangonan, Rizal Province. She and her husband have a fishing business and a hog fattening business. Despite many challenges they have faced in their life, they have never given up fighting against poverty.\r\n\r\nGlenda plans to utilize this loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos to expand her hog fattening business. This loan will be used to pay for more fattening agents and feeds.   Hog fattening is a common business for people in the area and Glenda feels the financial opportunity of hog fattening is one best way to provide for the basic needs of her family.  Hogs take approximately four to six months until they are ready for sale, and after that period of time the pigs will be either be sold alive or slaughtered for their meat.\r\n\r\nDuring her six years at Kiva partner microfinance institution ASHI, Glenda has shown very good performance as a member by maintaining an excellent repayment status and by having a good attendance record at meetings.  She hopes this loan will enable her to finally reach her dreams in life: to have a fully-fledged pig farm business, a good life and happy family, and a house that is free from flooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":671092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is a single mother of two who is working hard to ensure a better future for herself and her children. She has important emotional support from her parents, enabling her to open her business while studying for her Masters in Education. Orna is a private tutor and instructor from the prestigious Israeli Bar Ilan mathematics program for elementary through high school students. Orna is opening a math tutoring business for groups. She has a strong base of potential clientele from her existing tutoring and education connections. There is a strong need in Tel Aviv for math tutors, especially at Orna's level. The draw of group tutoring as opposed to individual is large since it holds down the individual costs for students, while creating a supportive small group atmosphere as well. For Orna, it means a larger amount of per hour income as opposed to one-on-one tutoring. \r\n\r\nThe loan is needed to pay for renovations to create a classroom setting, supplies and advertising.\r\n\r\nOrna will use her current connections with different schools in the area. With this loan, she is moving her business to a location with increased diversity and higher socio-economic possibilities. In the future, Orna wants to expand her business and hire additional tutors to work with the ever-growing number of student groups.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1638,"image":{"id":670213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

To make a living, Angelino buys and sells fruits and vegetables in the local community. Angelino has been engaged in his business for over 25 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Angelino joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Angelino is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Angelino from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":671047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She earns her living by selling fish. Her husband Danilo C., who is 43 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business. They have 8 children who range in age from 1 month to 16 years old. Six of her children go to school. \r\n\r\nMedilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Medilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save for the future, sustain their daily needs, and educate their children. Medilyn C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nThe photo was not taken at her business because the fish was already delivered to her buyers.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in  Barangay San Juan in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and canteen, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,500. \r\n\r\nElsie  is now borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can buy more groceries to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Elsie  aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has chosen not to despair, but has worked painstakingly hard in trying to forestall the above mentioned problems through buying medicines and improving the hygiene of her chicken house. In a way, this has helped her a lot as her chickens are now growing up healthy, sturdy and free of disease and stress. As a result, she has been able to resell more chickens to more clients.

Paul has had his farming business for three years in Jinja. He mostly sells crops, such as maize and beans, which he harvests from his gardens. Paul says he started out as a small scale farmer and later worked in a motorcycle transportation business, commonly referred to in Uganda as Boda Boda.

Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly priced capital and business education. Small businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":668441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To finance

N. is 53 years old. She is single and has four children aged between twenty one years old and nine years old. Her business is located at a busy market in Kakamega. Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and it is known as the sugar belt region. She sells cereals, which include ground nuts, peas, rice, wheat and others. She has been in this business for 20 years now and has one employee. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is that there are many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers so customers are not loyal as they are spoilt for choice.

The members came up with the name because that is how long they want the group to last:  forever.  This story is about Emma G. H., given she is the representative of this group.  She is 50 years old, and a widow with two children:  Maria del Carmen, 22, and Genaro, who is 21.  Both are in school; the oldest is in her second year of a Political Science degree, and the other is in his first year of studying for a teaching degree.  \r\n\r\nEmma dedicates herself to making and selling bread.  She decided on this business because she says there is a lot of demand, and it generates a good income.  In addition, she wanted to find a way to improve her and her family\u2019s standard of living and to provide her children with an education.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan into purchasing more ingredients such as: sugar, lard, flour, yeast and eggs, so she can increase production, offer a greater variety of products and to increase her sales.  She says that things are going very well with the business, so much so that she is putting aside some of her income to finish building the kitchen in her house and to continue supporting her children with their educations so they can embark on professional careers.  She also continues to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe comments that her business is benefiting her neighbors a great deal, since there are not many people who do what she does nearby.  Since she is close, they all buy from her.  In addition, she provides excellent attention and services to her customers and offers her products at a good price.\r\n\r\nEmma\u2019s dream is to build a larger locale in her own house, so she can expand her business.  She would like to open a bakery that she would have much better stocked so she could increase her earnings and pay for her children\u2019s advanced degrees.  She tells us that the members of the group are very responsible and punctual with their loan payments, since they have gotten to know each other, get along well, and are from the same community.  For these reasons, they have never fallen behind or defaulted on their payments, as they don\u2019t want to risk the trust that has been placed in them.  She is very thankful to the Foundation and to Kiva for the support of the loan granted to her since, thanks to this, her business is improving a great deal and it has changed their lives.  \r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cForever\u201d, and the activities they carry out, are as follows:\r\n\r\nEmma G.

Buyan operates a clothes trading business out of two different containers in his town with the help of his wife. They began their business in 2006, selling a variety of clothing items in a rented container at the local market, with working capital of 1,500,000 MNT, and over the years they managed to establish a successful business in the local community. After years of stable operation, they have expanded their business, and their earnings have enabled them to purchase two containers which they sell their products from. Today their working capital exceeds 6,000,000 MNT. With their business earnings, they were able to not only expand their business but also greatly improve their quality of life. Also, with their business success, they have managed to buy a car for their family. For the future, they plan to build a house in their yard. Buyan is a talkative and open-minded man and is requesting a 1,500,000 MNT loan in order to purchase more clothing as well as consumer goods to sell from his two containers.

E. is from the city of Sta.Cruz, Ozamiz City. She is 34 years old. Winnie is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Winnie works in someone else's business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from offering computer services to local community members. Winnie has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Winnie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Winnie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Winnie is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in a share of this business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Winnie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband, who is a fisherman, had caught more fish than usual in the lake. Elsa sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish brought bigger profits faster than any other kind of business she had in recent years. \r\n\r\nFish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of human beings, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal markets. Thus buying from vendors who come to their community is very attractive. Also, more people choose to buy fish than meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Elsa used her loan from ASHI in her fish-selling business. Out of the profit she made, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan to increase the volume of fish she sells so that someday, out of her business profit, she will be able to invest more in her home. \r\n\r\nBeing a 46-year-old woman, Elsa wants her children to have their own livelihood. She believes that her business is the only inheritance she can turn over to them.

Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nEdna presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and energy drinks to rice. Having been at least 15 years in business, she knows to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most importantly, her customers. Monthly she is able to earn an average of Php 8,800.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. Edna plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nEdna's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":672533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
