Sin embargo, Nancy Elena no cuenta con el capital suficiente para ello, por lo que espera que un cr\u00e9dito le permita acceder a la compra de una fileteadora y a realizarle el mantenimiento que requiere 2 m\u00e1quinas m\u00e1s. \nNancy Elena espera que con la compra de la nueva m\u00e1quina pueda generar otro puesto de trabajo, y seguir contribuyendo para que m\u00e1s personas puedan acceder a un trabajo remunerado y mejoren su calidad de vida. \nNancy Elena tiene el gran sue\u00f1o de que su taller crezca y pueda seguir ofreciendo m\u00e1s empleo y que su hijo pueda heredar una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica que le permita progresar en un futuro.\n","en":"Nancy Elena is a person who has been hit by life\u2019s adversity. Some time ago, her husband died and she was left a widow with a son to support. Nowadays, she is a single mother who is head of the household. She works hard driven by the desire that her son have the best quality of life possible along with a good education that will enable him to get a good job in the future.\r\n\r\nNancy Elena is well known in the area as being a very kind person with a very noble heart. She is always ready to help those who most need it. Seven years ago she started her tailoring workshop where she offers services to third parties and she started it because she used to work in a tailoring business where she acquired the skill but was very badly paid. Since them she has been working very hard in her tailoring shop and she is always looking for ways to grow her business so that she can generate jobs and contract those most in need. Currently Nancy Elena has four workers and her customers are faithful because her work is of very good quality.\r\n\r\nAt present Nancy Elena needs to buy a threading machine to increase her shop\u2019s productive capacity. She also needs to service two other machines in her workshop, however she lacks sufficient capital and hopes that a loan will enable her to buy the new machine and do necessary maintenance.\r\n\r\nNancy hopes that with the purchase of the threading machine she can generate another job and continue enabling more people to have access to paid work so they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe has a big dream that her workshop will expand and she can continue offering employment and that her son will inherit economic stability enabling him to succeed in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.68,"image":{"id":986364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a  threading machine and to service two machines in her workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-22T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":59410},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":61086},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62809},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":64581},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66403},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":68276},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":70202},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72182},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74218},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76312},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78465},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80678},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82954},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85294},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87700},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90174},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":92718},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95333},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98022},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100788},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103631},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":106554},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":109560},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":112650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.68,"local_amount":59410,"processed_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":60024.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362200,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-22T10:17:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382606,"name":"Reyna Antolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Reyna es una se\u00f1ora amable que se dedica a la venta de refrescos, jugos y desayunos  desde  hace un  a\u00f1o.\nEsta felizmente casada con el se\u00f1or Eusebio  Agust\u00edn un se\u00f1or trabajador  que la ayuda en lo que pueda ya que trabaja de alba\u00f1il y casi no tiene tiempo de  ayudarla.\nTambien se dedica a la venta de maiz.\nElla pidi\u00f3 el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de m\u00e1s refrescos de diferentes sabores.\nLe da las gracias a fundaci\u00f3n por apoyarla en todo ya que sin su apoyo no tendr\u00eda lo que ahora a tiene.\n","en":"Sra.

The main water run-off system in this area is the Reventazon River, which starts up in the Cueric\u00ed mountain.  Because of the fertility of its land, due to its volcanoes and floodplains, Cartago is a town where agriculture and livestock production are the main economic activities.\r\n\r\nRosibel has been selling clothing for a number of years.  She started out as an intermediary selling merchandise from others, and gradually she has been making her own garments.  But at this time, she lacks the money to make her business expand, which would benefit the neighbors in her community.  So Rosibel is requesting a small loan of 600,000 Costa Rican colones to invest in her business and buy more clothing, since the demand is strong.  Her goal is to have a store in the future that she could fill with merchandise. This would allow Rosibel and her family to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosibel is a member of the \"Fuente Agricola\" communal bank, one of the 150 such organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.

All are in school, and with a lot of effort on the part of both he and his wife, he is helping them get ahead in life. Currently they are at university, except for the youngest, who is in fourth year of secondary education. \r\n\r\nAs a good Peruvian, he loves our cooking, especially his favorite dish, \"Tallar\u00edn Saltado\" (noodles sauteed with tomatoes, onions, and soy sauce). \r\n\r\nEusebio studied Music, not only as a career, but also because it is his passion.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Eusebio plays music in our city's cemetery. His faithful ally in his business is his accordion, with which he plays countless melodies. He works around six hours daily, depending on the number of people who come to the cemetery. \r\n\r\nThe reason he does it, he tells us, is that it is very moving to see people burying their family members, or remembering the year of their passing. But he feels that with his music he can aleviate in part, the pain and sadness that they feel. Sometimes he has cried while he was playing his music, but life goes on, and one has to move forward. \r\n\r\nHe thinks that because of the sensitivity he has, it is going well for him in his business; he understands the pain and suffering that his customers are going through, and that is why he has work. \r\n\r\nEusebio is very happy, and very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their help he will be able to undetake the paperwork necessary to obtain his certification as a music teacher. With this step forward, he will be able to teach music, and so earn greater income to improve his quality of life.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, with groceries, toiletries and beverages. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoreta hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work.

is Rosemarie, 48, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is a widow, and mother to four children. Together with her children, she manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the everyday expenses of the family.\r\n\r\nRosemarie operates a dried fish retailing business. What she basically does is buy dried fish from wholesalers, then she repacks them and sells them per piece\/pack with a profit. Products can range from dried fish to dried anchovies and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP16,000 loan.

After finishing high school, Yura went to the Kapan technical college and graduated with a diploma in construction. So far Yura is single and lives together with his parents.\r\nYura\u2019s whole family has been doing farm work for seven years. On his own land plot, Yura grows apples for sale. Since his own  plot is small, he also leases [additional] land for growing potatoes for sale, using the rest  as grazing land for his livestock. Yura and his parents raise cattle, sheep, bees and chickens.\r\n\r\nYura and his parents sell potatoes and apples at markets in the Syunik province. Meat, milk, honey and wool are sold directly out of their home to  loyal customers. Thanks to   farm work, Yura and his family are able to provide for the household needs.\r\nYura needs a loan of 300,000 ADM in order to buy five sheep, which will allow him to increase his family\u2019s income in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":53.32,"image":{"id":986970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 5 more sheep for his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yura","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20430},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":19560},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20110},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20280},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20360},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20980},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21100},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21430},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21820},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":21980},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":22560},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":22770},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":23090},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":23530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.32,"local_amount":20641.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20730.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404943,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T17:14:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382811,"name":"Rene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rene is 58 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He is married to a trader, and has 4 children aged 12, 9, 6 years and a 10 months old baby, two are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because he helps in the business. In 2005, Osman established his electronics business.  He began his business because of the rebel war that broke in his country of Sierra Leone. Osman says, \"I was in form three (school grade 9 in the U.S) when the rebels attacked us in our village called Sanda twenty miles off from Makeni. Then we fled to Makeni and started working for people for our survival. During that time, I started raising funds until I got a substantial amount to start my business.\" Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,796,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 . Osman has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan and now needs a new loan in order to buy tape (6 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Lr125,000, radio - 10 pieces @ Le45,000, radio with memory card - 5 pieces @ Le75,000, tape (4 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Le65,000 and electronic lanterns - 1 carton @ Le1,000,000.  The balance will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 269,000. In the future, Osman plans to open a shop. He felt good about taking out this loan as it helps him to boost his business.  He wants his children to have a good education. The loan will help greatly because he will be able to make a profit out of it.  Increases in the cost of goods affects him greatly because as costs change, he has to change his selling prices which affects his customers' buying pattern.  He offers quality products.  Osman serves at least 20 people per day around the city.  His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and with respect.  He is assisted by family members. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week.  He saves some of his profit, some he uses to add to his working capital. He plans to expand if he is given subsequent loans that will enable him to accomplish his dreams.

She is a widow and has 1 child aged 24 years. She has 2 additional dependents. In 1980, Isatu established her essential drugs (tablets, syrups, pain killers) business. She began her business because she dropped out of school when she became pregnant by her late husband. Her parents asked her to marry him as they thought it was the best decision.  Since her dreams of going to medical school were shattered, she was given some amount of money after given birth, which she used to start selling medication. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 3,585,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 538,000. In the future, Isatu plans to complete her unfinished building. She felt good as this loan is helping her to improve her business.  She is nervous about the future. She hopes for her adopted children to have a good education.  The loan will serve as another source of income.  \r\n\r\nChanges in government policies such as increases in taxes are her problem, but in terms of competition, it is moderate as she only has one competitor in that area.  She serves patients from the nearby hospital and retailers, about 50 people per day.  Her business is popular because she has good customer care and offers a legal business.

She is a hardworking woman with a lot of drive to get ahead. She lives with her partner, with whom she has a daughter with three children of her own. They live together in a house she owns. Yolanda's business is handicrafts sales. Her son makes these crafts at the detention facility where he is currently imprisoned. As part of a social inclusion program, the inmates make craftwork. She sells these ornaments to friends and to people who sell them as a traveling business, so that she can support her son. She has been in this business for over two years. She enjoys it because she feels she is helping her son who needs her. Besides, with the profits from her sales, she gets an income she can invest in order for her son to make more handicrafts. She is saving her profits to set up a handicraft shop in her own house, so that her son can work in it once he's reintegrated into society. This is her first loan with MFP and for that reason she hopes to get your support so that she can continue pursuing her goals. With the requested loan of 700 nuevos soles, she will set up a shop like the one her son has at the detention facility by purchasing tools and supplies to make handicrafted ornaments."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":82.45,"image":{"id":987730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase tools and supplies to make handicrafts.

children.  He has been used to physical labor since childhood.  He and his father started a dekhan farm five years.  It was difficult to start the business, and they had debts.

Her farm products, like milk, maize, beans and vegetables, are being sold locally.\r\n\r\nDorice has requested a loan of 31,200 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow. She says this will increase her milk output both for family consumption and income generation. She emphasizes that farming has been her sole source of income for the 7 years she has been married.
