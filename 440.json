O. is from the village of Lao Sta. Cruz. She is 49 years old. Lilia is married and has 4 children. To make a living, Lilia owns & operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Lilia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lilia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Lilia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Lilia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Biasong. She is 37 years old. Ana is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Ana owns & operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Ana has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ana joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Ana is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Ana from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T. is from the village of Biasong. She is 38 years old. Noralyn is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Noralyn owns & operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Noralyn has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Noralyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noralyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Noralyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Noralyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. Anita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her eleventh from PMPC.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. Leonarda is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her 13th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

In 2004, Saltanat got married in second time and gave birth to two sons.

He lives with his mother and one brother. After the death of his father, he took the responsibility of meeting the family expenses. As with the majority of the Lebanese men, his story illustrates the day-to-day challenges in working hard to support their families with their business income. He has been working as a car electrician for almost eight years. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1000 from the Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional tools for his business. In the future, he hopes to continue expansion of his business. He expects the coming year to be successful and to further increase his business productivity.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Micro-finance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She has three children. After the death of her husband, she found herself alone taking the responsibility for her children. As a result she decided to work in the occupation she knows, so she established a tailoring business in her home in 2000. With her business income, she was able to support her family. Now her children are starting to work and they help their mother to satisfy the heavy demands of their life.\r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase tailoring supplies and additional textiles to produce a variety of products for her clientele so as to earn more income.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Micro-finance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free Kiva loans to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

He has two young children who attend school. He is the main provider for his family with his business income. He has owned a car painting shop in his town since 1990. During this long period, he has gained good experience and a good reputation in this field. He is requesting a loan of $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to increase his capital to improve and expand his business. In the future, he is looking to diversify his business and open a new shop where he can buy and sell spare car parts\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Kiva borrower is a 50-year old single man from Lebanon. He lives with his two old parents and he takes care of them. He has more than 25 years experience working in car electric repair. His shop is situated in his town and he is known by the neighboring towns also.\r\n\r\nHe ensures the household expenses are paid for sick and aging family members. He was able, over the years, to enlarge his business and create a good base of clients asking for his services. Today, he is asking to borrow $1,000 to purchase new electric tools and supplies instead of the used ones. He\u2019s sure that with the new equipment he will be able to deliver his services faster and take more work.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<b\/>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers.

He has owned a mini-market in his village for the past 12 years. He sells in his grocery shop all types of food products, dairy products, juices, soft drinks, beads etc. His shop is situated in a busy area so there are a good number of customers passing by his shop. This is his second loan requested from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. He has been very reliable with his repayments. He is requesting a larger loan amount of $2,000 to increase his shop inventory to be prepared for the coming holidays in Lebanon where the selling rate will be increased.

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She lives with her husband (who is an entrepreneur), her husband\u2019s second wife and their children in Sanoubougou I-Koulikoro, one of the peripheral districts of the town of Sikasso (the third administrative region of Mali). \r\n\r\nHaving tried various business activities without success, over six years ago Mrs. A\u00efssata M. started selling fruits (pineapples, avocados, bananas, plantains, oranges etc). She sells near the Customs\u2019 office in Sikasso. In order to better satisfy the demands of her growing customer base, about three years ago she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She obtained two individual loans in the past and repaid them well. \r\n\r\nAnd thus she is seeking a third loan, which will allow her to buy a large supply of fruit (pineapples, avocados, plantains, oranges etc) from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire; she sells retail and wholesale to customers coming from all layers of society. With this third loan she plans to achieve a monthly income of 115,000 West African Francs, which will be used to bolster her business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on her loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":579829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A\u00efssata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40515.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180829,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476800,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613509,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751941,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606193,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917866,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T09:41:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220613,"name":"Hurelbaatar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hurelbaatar B. is 33 years old and lives with his wife and three children in the Chingeltey district of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in their own ger, a traditional nomadic housing tent.

He lives with his family in his own house in Banconi, one of the outer suburbs of the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nHaving trained as a therapist, he launched himself rapidly into the pharmaceutical business more than twenty years ago. With such a long experience in this domain, he enjoys a good reputation and gets a lot of orders; his resources are however insufficient to satisfy these needs. He thus decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, from which he has already had two individual loans, both of which were repaid correctly. \r\n\r\nWith a view to constantly improving his business, he is requesting a third loan which will allow him to buy ten cartons of \"manames\", nine containers of Indian \"inzam\" and three cartons of Aloe (natural medecines).\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies in Lom\u00e9 (in the Republic of Togo); previously (before he joined Soro Yiriwaso) he stocked up from his supplier in Koutiala in order to resell in his pharmacy in Sikasso's bus station to a customer base made up of travelers, and above all lorry drivers. Some of his customers pay cash and others buy on credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 300,000FCFA. With the profits he makes he hopes to be able to cover the bulk of his expenses and those of his family, as well as paying the interest on his loan; the rest will be invested in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":579837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"Purchase of medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":127779.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180832,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476803,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613512,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751944,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606196,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917869,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63889.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360798,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T20:18:58Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220619,"name":"Yayah Y.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yayah is married with one dependent.

To satisfy her customers' needs of quality and quantity, and to increase the size of her business, she decided to appeal to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso 5 years ago.  After 5 solidarity loans (group loans) all paid back in full, she is on her sixth individual loan, all of which were paid back without difficulty.  With this loan, she expects to buy 3 baskets of bananas, 5 baskets of potatoes, 7 baskets of oranges and other things.  She gets her supplies in the different weekly fairs in the villages surrounding Koutiala and Sikasso and makes her sales at the big market in Koutiala to a customer base composed of men and women, for cash and credit.  She expects to make an average profit of 70,000 FCFA per month, which she plans to use to pay back her interest, to contribute to the daily expenditures of her family, and to invest the remainder in other revenue-generating businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Martha Schmitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":579841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolondi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180833,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476804,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613513,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751945,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42385.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606197,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T11:11:49Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220622,"name":"Haoua","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Haoua Tour\u00e9  a 41 ans mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants.

This is where all the commercial activity in the district takes place. \r\n\r\nNine years ago he started raising and selling poultry, mostly ducks, from home.

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. Bimala has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and is using her most recent loan to increase the inventory in her shop.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Bimala plans to continue her business.  She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh vegetables are purchased from the local farmers and sold.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and will use her most recent loan to increase the inventory in her store.  In the future, Nirmala plans to continue and increase her grocery business.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

With this loan, she will buy basic grains, dairy products, snacks, soft drinks, canned goods and other items, so that she can increase her inventory and sell more. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":580025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Buying basic grains, snacks, soft drinks, dairy products and other items to increase her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-08-07T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.83,"local_amount":1980.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1990.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205177,"comment":null},{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":754.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":758.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182466018,"comment":null},{"amount":41.99,"local_amount":895.71,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":900.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098147,"comment":null},{"amount":41.98,"local_amount":895.6,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":900.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348724,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":888.9,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":893.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766398,"comment":null},{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":895.43,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":900.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209451,"comment":null},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":858.3,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":862.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078263,"comment":null},{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":831.06,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":835.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147338,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T12:25:14Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220699,"name":"Gaudencio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gaudencio is a humble and hardworking family-oriented businessman. He has over ten years of experience as a salesman and two years ago opened his own business. His storefront business sells CDs, records, clothing, and gifts. Gaudencio\u2019s wife and one of his sisters help him run the store. His business attracts the growing Latino population in his community.\r\n\r\nOne of Gaudencio\u2019s greatest challenges is that he doesn\u2019t always have the goods that his customers are looking for. With his second ACCION USA loan, Gaudencio will be able to diversify his inventory by purchasing more clothing and Mexican accessories. This will allow him to retain more customers who come into his store looking for specific items. \r\n\r\nGaudencio has enjoyed being his own boss and generating extra income for his family. He felt the hardships of the economic crisis when no bank would lend to him. Receiving a loan from ACCION USA has allowed him to maintain his business and support his family. Gaudencio hopes to continue growing his business so that his family will be well off some day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

moved to the United States from Ecuador in 1999 with her family. In Ecuador she received her degree in Business Administration and practiced in the field for 25 years. When she moved to the United States, she didn\u2019t speak English very well, so she wasn\u2019t able to get a job in her field. In 1999, just months after moving to Boston, she started her own day care. \r\n\r\nStarting her own business has allowed Teresa to provide an additional income for her family. She enjoys working with the children and owning her own business. The income generated from her day care also allowed her family to purchase the house in which they are living. \r\n\r\nTeresa\u2019s greatest challenge is the summer months. Between June and August many families take their children out of the day care for vacation and summer camps. During these months, Teresa has a hard time maintaining her cash flow and paying her three employees. Another challenge has been that many parents took their children out of day care during the economic crisis. Many decided to take care of their children at home instead of paying for her services.\r\n\r\nThis is Teresa\u2019s 2nd loan with ACCION USA, with which she\u2019ll be better able to maintain her business and pay employees during the summer months. She hopes to be better prepared for low attendance next summer, so that she doesn\u2019t run into this problem again. She knows that come September she will be back up to capacity in her day care. Teresa\u2019s day care is well known in the greater Boston area and she receives many new clients through referrals.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business?

She began this business six years ago with the help of her husband and now with that of her children, supporting the family with the earnings from this business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to invest in packing materials for her next harvest, since she says that is the most important thing because in this way the flowers stay fresher and live longer.  Her customers have the same opinion; they say they are looking for better packaging.  She is well-known in flower sales for her attituD. about selling; she is an aggressive businesswoman because of the effort she puts into her sales.\r\n\r\nShe always shows the happiness that characterizes her.  This is the true reason for naming the group Las Alegres.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Ana Isabel is the first woman from left to right, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and blue pants.

Formerly, the city of Cusco was the capital of the Inca Empire and one of the most important cities of the Per\u00fa Viceregency.  The city of Cusco is noted for its beautiful scenery but most of all for its historical value.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto was a member of Cusco\u2019s \u201cCienciano\u201d football team; he was a goalie.  Currently, Jos\u00e9 Alberto teaches football at \u201cAusangate\u201d school located in the Larapa area of Cusco.  He has been teaching this king of sports for 20 years.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago Jos\u00e9 Alberto opened an eatery in his home where he provided meals like breakfasts and lunch to his customers.  His customers would pay for the service in advance.  However, due to travel needs, Jos\u00e9 had to close his restaurant.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto is married and has four children.\r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, he converted rooms in his home into rental units and opened a boarding house.  One can find him in his home, which is equipped to provide regular basic needs, seven days a week from 5am until quite late in the evening.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto comes across as a kind, cheerful person.  His boarding house has a regular stream of customers and on weekends or during Cusco\u2019s festivals it becomes quite animated. Jos\u00e9 Alberto also rented his house to Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa located in the city of Quillabamba.\r\n\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto expects to receive $500 USD in his next loan.  For the moment, his boarding house is modestly equipped with the basic things.  He\u2019d like to use this money to buy a washing machine and a television set.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto is an enterprising, responsible and punctual man.  For this reason, his friends invited him to participate in Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa\u2019s \u201cEl Amanecer\u201d (Dawn) communal bank.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to open a well equipped football school for youngsters in the city of Quillabamba in hopes of producing players for the European League.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Hu\u1ec7 owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of food products in the local community.  Hu\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be Hu\u1ec7\u2019s 2nd loan from SEDA.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and

Leliosa has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Leliosa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leliosa has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Leliosa is requesting a new loan of 2,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Leliosa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 35 years old. Rowena is the group leader of a 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rowena O..\r\n\r\nRowena is married and has three school-aged children. Rowena owns and operates a clothing business. The main source of income for the business comes from selling second hand clothes within their village. Rowena has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 2500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rowena joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Rowena is requesting a  loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional clothes to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rowena from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They all live in the village of Moudjirila in the urban community of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of Mali) and know one another through marital and parental ties.  With the goal of increasing their cultivable land, they appealed to Soro Yiriwaso and are on their second farm loan.  Millet, fonio (a millet grown in Mali), peanuts and rice are the crops cultivated by the members of the group.  Mrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 expects to use her loan to buy 2 bags of complex fertilizer, 20 kg of peanut seeds and to recruit the manual labor for the labor and hoeing activities in the fields.  She gets her supply of agricultural inputs at the large market in S\u00e9gou, and her manual labor from the association of young people and women of the village.  She hopes to produce 13 bags of peanuts, 6 bags of millet and 3 bags of fonio on her 1.5 hectares of cultivable land.  The millet and fonio she produces she consumes herself, while the peanuts produced are sold to pay for the health needs of her children, perishable foods and social cases.

She lives with her nuclear family in the M\u00e9dine district of Segou (the third administrative district of Mali).\r\n\r\nShe is a secretary at the S\u00e9gou Customs office; parallel to that work, she also earns money through other business activities, mainly selling juice, which she has been doing for 35 years. She learned this trade from her mother, who used to sell juice by primary schools during recess. Her strong side is the high quality of her juice, well prepared and carefully conserved. II order to make her jjuice, she uses 5 kg [11 lbs] of sugar, 1 kg [2.2. lbs] of ginger, 2 kg [4.8 lbs] of tamarind, 20 packs of vanilla and 4 packs of powdered juice (banana, mango and orange).\r\n\r\nAll ingredients are mixed in with 1.5 liter [about 1.6 qt] of water in order to achieve the desired taste. The beverage is then poured into cans which had been carefully washed and  placed in the refrigerator to chill. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her  working capital and earn a higher revenue, Mrs. C. has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been a member for 12 months. After duly repaying her first individual loan, she is seeking a second loan in order to purchase a freezer. She stocks up locally. \r\n\r\nMrs. Djeneba C. sells for cash and in credit to a customer base composed of both women and men.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to achieve a monthly income of 150,000 West African Francs. This will allow her to support herself and to take part in social event such as baptisms, weddings etc.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

She is an attentive mother and her children are her reason for living.  The family lives with Alidia's mother-in-law.  For the past 3 years, she and her husband have grown potatoes, peas, maize and gladiolus on land given to them by the mother-in-law.  Since the birth of her youngest child, Alidia hasn't been able to work as hard as before and, consequently, she limits herself to taking care of the animals--bulls, rams, horses and donkeys--that help them to move agricultural tools and supplies to the fields where they work.  The parts of the business that Alidia likes best is drying the maize after a harvest and selling gladiolus in the city's flower market.  Her husband wants to raise cattle so she wants to buy bulls.  She also wants to continue with the farming business.

They have a 4-year old son, Nelvis, and live in a house that they own.  They grow potatoes, peas, oats, maize and gladiolus.  Emergildo has farmed for 15 years.  At harvest time, he counts on support from his wife.  He also operates a store.  Emergildo works every day from early in the morning.  In addition to the farm, he raises sheep which he then sells.  The earnings go to supporting his family.  He also has donkeys that help him move agricultural tools and supplies to the fields where he works.  What he most likes about his work is plowing his fields before planting.  The farm is fairly profitable and he is able to cover the family's expenses and provide them with a decent quality of life.

She has operated a farming business for 10 years, growing broad beans, potatoes, peas, maize and gladiolus, that she then sells on market days.  Her husband, who works erecting power lines for an electric utility, helps her on the farm.  Carmen also hires laborers during the planting and harvesting season to speed up the work.  What she most likes about the business is planting and harvesting peas because the return on the crop in the city's wholesale market comes to S\/.50 (50 new soles) a bag.  Farming is a good business for Carmen because the profits from the business cover the family's expenses.  She wants to continue farming and plant bigger crops.  She would also like to set up a shop to sell basic food items.  This is Carmen's fourth MFP loan.  She likes working with her community bank because she considers them family and because they have taught her how to be more responsible.  She will use this loan to buy seed for the farm and supplies to set up a shop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":580470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Seed for farming business.

Her parents taught her this work and that is why now she and her husband are teaching all of the agricultural techniques to their children, who occasionally help them with small jobs in the field, cultivating coffee, plantains, and avocadoes. She enjoys very much the different kinds of work she does in the fields and when she needs to make her work go more quickly she hires workers. In this way she can rest assured, knowing that she will have good production. \r\n\r\nElsa is very prudent because she is convinced that a good harvest depends on being attentive. She considers her work in agriculture to be quite profitable, because it allows her to buy land, educate her children, and to cover a variety of daily expenses.

This is the third time she has had a loan with MFP and she is sure to continue working hard like she has up to this point because she likes working with her communal bank.

For this reason Esther is very dedicated to her job planting gladioli, potatoes, peas and maize. She has been working with her husband doing this for 10 years. Esther loves the tranquility that the country gives her, but it is an inconvenience for her to transport her harvest to the market in the city. She considers the profits that her agricultural labour gives her are very good, so she has planned to sow a greater quantity of plants because she is sure she will be able to look after them adequately. Esther also wants to purchase a car to provide a public transport service. This is the third loan she has had from MFP and she is very thankful for the confidence that they have shown. For Esther, this loan signifies an opportunity to improve her situation, and she also likes working in her communal bank.

She used her savings to open an industrial bakery 'El Crocandito' in her house, where she sells special breads, snacks and cakes. You can find her in her bakery, which is equipped with various display cases, 7 days a week, from very early until quite late at night or until her supply of bread finishes. Ericka gives off an image of experience and friendliness. A regular flow of customers visit her bakery and the business becomes quite busy during breakfast and lunch hours. Ericka sells good quality bread at a cheap price. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":580534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase a display case and ingredients to make dough ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ericka Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":95.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":101.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.62,"local_amount":95.62,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":95.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166801244,"comment":null},{"amount":98.49,"local_amount":98.49,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":98.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172071017,"comment":null},{"amount":101.44,"local_amount":101.44,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362314,"comment":null},{"amount":104.45,"local_amount":104.45,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-11T04:18:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":220949,"name":"Ysabel Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel Catalina A.

She is a fighter with a lot of dreams.  She lives in her own house together with her 34-year-old husband, Teofilo, and their three children, who are her reason for living.  Together with her husband, she has spent the last 14 years growing potatoes, gladiolas, peas, and corn on their own property as well as rented land.  During harvest time, the couple contracts operators to speed up the work, but Nancy is always responsible for taking care of the land since she likes to plant peas and gladiolas, two products in high demand at her local markets.  It inconveniences her to pull out the bad grass that invades her farm land but she takes the extra time to do so since it is necessary to keep the land clean.  \r\n\r\nThese past few months, Nancy's husband has learned to make doors, windows, and metal furniture, which is a very profitable business.  For this reason, the couple wants to install a metallurgy shop in their home.

C. is from the town of Dumabato Norte, MadD., Quirino. She is 33 years old. Mellany is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMellany is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mellany owns & operates a business selling frozen foods. Mellany has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mellany joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mellany has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mellany is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Mellany from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":579843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
