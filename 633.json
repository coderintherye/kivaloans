She sells women's clothes, bedspreads and table mats to a customer base which is made up of neighbors, family members and people who she has been recommended to.  They increasingly make more demands for quality products and expect better prices.  This makes Nelys very excited and awakens her creativity even more.  Her big challenge is ensuring that her working capital stretches far enough to allow her to respond to her customers in a timely fashion as she sells most of her products on credit.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan - her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo - to buy raw materials and supplies, in different colors and textures.  She will buy in larger volumes so that she can obtain discounts and adapt to her customers' needs with respect to fashion.\r\n\r\nNelys learned the art of dressmaking from her aunt when she was very young and, when she grew up, she chose this as her main business activity.  She bought her first machine and since then she hasn't stopped.  Now, at 54 years old, she feels very happy to have made this decision because, over the years, she has managed to capture a very profitable market and people recommend her to other customers.  She is currently starting a new line of products, making hammocks, which are currently very much in fashion.

is Esperansa, 47, a resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Ediegario, a vendor, and mother to their child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEsperansa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Esperansa earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEsperansa hopes to be able to expand soon.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is Nenita, 31, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to July Tito, a driver, and she is a mother of two children. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. Like most Filipino parents, Nenita believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNenita operates an internet caf\u00e9 business. There is more need, now than before, for services like these as customers\u2019 demand increases. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need to rent computers for business purposes like writing a resume or any office documentation, as well as people who just love to surf the net and social networks. Aside from the internet caf\u00e9, Nenita is into direct selling. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 619 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy an additional computer, mouse, keyboard, mouse pad, and other supplies for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNenita dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":814362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To pay

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Marivic earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from the direct selling business, Marivic also earns by selling frozen food products. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 266 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and frozen food products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarivic hopes to be able to expand soon, and send all her children to school all the way through college.

She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nFedelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Fedelina earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from the variety store business, Fedelina also earns by selling RTW products. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and RTW products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFedelina dreams of giving all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Ruth owns a guest house and therefore offers accommodation to the traders who come to town and to tourists who sometimes trickle into the local area to see some of Ntungamo's fascinating scenery. Ruth loudly explains how happy she is to have managed to set up and run a good accommodation facility for five years with a steady income of 150,000 Ugandan shillings as average weekly profits. She, however, stresses that it has not been easy but through hard work, valuing customers and above all, providing comfortable accommodation and an environment that has made it a place to think about as a priority for accommodation in the area. \r\n\r\nThis determined woman, with a temperament for work, also participates in agriculture particularly in banana growing and her goal in future is to open up a modern restaurant within the guest house to sell her bananas since she has a ready market. With the Kiva loan, Ruth intends to expand and modernize her banana plantation by mulching and applying fertilisers for better yields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":813909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To mulch and apply fertilisers to her banana plantation for better yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-19T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asaph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ephraim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asaph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":420062.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022798,"comment":null},{"amount":467.64,"local_amount":1199082.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1208855.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868560,"comment":null},{"amount":185.93,"local_amount":476735,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":480620.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648394,"comment":null},{"amount":158.93,"local_amount":407516,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":410837.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313751,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-19T18:13:38Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":317286,"name":"Mwale Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima, who is in her early 50s, is married with two adult children and two grandchildren who go to school.

She says that if she had not gone into business, she would probably be at a wits end, trying to bring value to her life and to that of her family. \r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of close relatives and friends, Zaituni decided to start up this business. Because of what she had gone through, Zaituni believed only hard work, prayers and determination would see her bringing a new lease to her family's narrow circumstances. The restaurant business is quite lucrative, provided one has a steady supply of food. This supply of food can, in most cases, be easy if one owns a farm where they can get food to cook and sell. For Zaituni, the supply of food would, in most cases, be achieved through food purchases from the many food markets in Jinja. In the course of time, her working capital was rising. The rise was mostly down to that fact that her clientele was increasing. This meant she was able to consolidate her profits and also improve on the facilities, food and service delivery at her restaurant.\r\n\r\nZaituni had always thought she would not be able to take care of her beloved children without her erstwhile Husband. But here she was able to provide for her family and relatives without her man. 300,000 Ugandan shillings is what this business generates for her on a monthly basis as income. She is requesting for this Kiva loan to purchase more furniture, cutlery and foods for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":814596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more furniture, cutlery and foods for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-19T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaituni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaloli","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yudaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marget","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atibu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":11800000,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2360000},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2360000},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2360000},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2360000},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2360000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":915},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":915},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":915},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":915},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":915}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":872.54,"local_amount":2250475,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2255505.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248995,"comment":null},{"amount":1872.85,"local_amount":4830525,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4841322.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868565,"comment":null},{"amount":914.61,"local_amount":2359000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2364272.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648399,"comment":null},{"amount":847.34,"local_amount":2185500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2190384.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313756,"comment":null},{"amount":67.66,"local_amount":174500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":174890.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275572,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-20T03:45:57Z","paid_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":317396,"name":"Josef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josef is 47 years old.

He began his business because he wants to make himself independent and be able to provide a livelihood for his family. Working seven days a week and 15 hours a day, he earns about 880,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 in order to buy patient drugs.

He says, \u201cIt costs absolutely nothing to get onto Facebook or LinkedIn, but the big price is time, and time, literally, is money when you\u2019re running a business.\u201d Steve aims to take out this problem of time by managing his clients\u2019 social media presence, allowing them to focus solely on running their businesses.\n\nImpresa Social Marketing, which will begin accepting clients on August 1st, will use Steve\u2019s marketing experience to create compelling and regularly-updated business profiles on social media venues like Facebook and LinkedIn. Before starting his business, Steve worked in events marketing, where he learned that social media management was an increasingly important part of his job. This experience serves as the underpinning for Steve\u2019s business practices at Impresa. \n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of his approach to social media management, Steve is now managing three companies promotionally. He says, \u201cWe have about a dozen businesses waiting for us to roll out the business, but I don\u2019t want to start until I have all of my ducks in a row.\u201d The promotional clients serve as both a tool for Steve to perfect his practice and as a way to advertise his services to potential clients. \n\nOne of the most difficult parts of beginning Impresa has been emphasizing the importance of a regularly updated and constantly changing social media presence to his clients. \u201cI would get a lot of people saying, \u2018Well, my nephew made my Facebook page already.\u2019 The problem with this is that social media is organic; it needs to be constantly changing in order to keep the interest of potential customers.\u201d Though this was a problem initially, the success of Steve\u2019s promotional clients has been enough to illustrate the importance of the type of social media presence that his business aims to create.\n\nThis loan has allowed Steve to lay the groundwork for his upcoming grand opening. With it, he purchased computer equipment, such as a PC pad, and software called Market Me, which will allow him to manage all of his clients\u2019 pages at one time. This will allow him to take on a large number of clients without worrying about wasting time toggling between several screens.\n\nSteve says one of his business\u2019 biggest assets is that it is \u201cin your area.\u201d Working directly with clients by going to their places of business to take pictures and interact with the business owners is extremely important to the success of his business. In the future, he hopes to expand by placing account managers in other areas \u2013 this will allow him to continue to offer the one-on-one service valued by his customers while extending his business\u2019 reach beyond its current borders of his small town.\n\nYou can visit Impresa Social Marketing\u2019s website at

productos los trae de un pueblo llamado Chibolo en el departamento del Magdalena y que cuenta con un poco m\u00e1s de 16.000 habitantes, valles fluviales, algunas elevaciones de tierra,  sitio que Omar recuerda con mucha alegr\u00eda porque de all\u00ed es oriundo.  \nSu negocio inici\u00f3 cuando se puso de acuerdo con un amigo para vender algo y Omar escogi\u00f3 la venta de cerdo, pues ten\u00eda conocidos con mucha experiencia en su natal Chibolo. Empez\u00f3 de casa en casa vendi\u00e9ndolo hasta que logr\u00f3 una clientela un poco estable. Posteriormente adicion\u00f3  un punto de venta dominical y agreg\u00f3 otros productos como queso suero, miel de abejas, y gallinas criollas. El cerdo los comercializa los fines de semana, con un promedio de 40 a 50kls, cuenta con una muy buena clientela entre sus familiares, amigos y vecinos; su negocio no tiene endeudamiento, todas sus compras las hace de contado y las ventas de estos productos en su mayor\u00eda  tambi\u00e9n son de contado.

He brings these products from a village called Chibolo in the department of Magdalena. It is known to have more than 16000 inhabitants, alluvial plains, and a few hills. As a native of the region Omar thinks about this place very fondly. He stated out his business when he came into an agreement with a friend to sell something and Omar chose the sale of pork meat. He knew many individuals with much experience in his native town of Chibolo. He started out selling from door to door until he gained a somewhat stable clientele. Later he started out selling form his home and he added other products for sale, such as cheese, whey protein, honey, and poultry. He sells pork on the weekends, averaging between 40 to 50 kilograms. He has a very good clientele among his family, friends, and neighbors. His business is not credit-based. All of his purchases are done in cash and product sales are also for the most part completed in cash. His sales cover his costs and generate a profit that permits him to cover the family's expenses. His liquidity index ratio is good and it is sufficient to fulfill the commitment he plans on undertaking with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). His accounts receivable have a fast turn around as does his inventory. His profitability margins show the efficiency and solvency of the business for future commitments. Omar wants to grow more each day and he needs an additional working capital to attend to his new clientele.
