P. is from the village of Napurog, Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 59 years old. Lourdes is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Lourdes owns and operates a business making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling poultry products in the local community. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 1,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lourdes joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Lourdes from PMPC.

She has four children, 3 girls and a boy, and her husband is a truck driver.\r\n<p>\r\nOn Negros Island, driving a truck is a seasonal job. Truck drivers are mostly in demand during the sugar milling season, which runs for 10 months a year.  Years with a poor sugar crop result in even less demand for truck drivers.\r\nIn 2002 Elena made a wise decision to have an independent source of income by starting a \"sari-sari, or general store after she received her first cycle loan.\r\n<p>\r\nHer efforts are paying off, and she proudly tells how her business income has allowed her to send her children to college. Her oldest child graduated in 2007 with a Midwifery diploma, and her second-oldest daughter graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Education.  Her youngest children are still in school.  The third child is studying to be an Electrical Engineer, and the youngest is studying Computer Programming. \r\n<p>\r\nRecently, Elena started a new business offering vulcanizing services and selling gasoline to tricycle (a motorcycle with a side car) and motorcycle drivers who drive the narrow roads and rough farm paths in their area.  Repairing flat tires and selling small amounts of gasoline has proven to be a lucrative business, especially since the nearest gasoline station is located in the town of Pontevedra. \r\n<p>\r\nElena is happy to testify that she is thankful for the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon.  With the help of NWTF she is moving forward in her objective to provide a good future for her children, and a comfortable living for her and her husband.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few, but thousands of women.  Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams.

He acquired these vehicles through much effort and dedication because, though young, he is very responsible and wants to get ahead and make a better future for himself.  He usually rents out one of his mototaxis on a daily basis and he drives the other one from very early in the morning until 8 at night.  This is very exhausting work because he must go from one end of town to the other according to his passengers' wishes.  Besides, the noise of the engine is very uncomfortable but Jose Luis has been able to rise above these inconveniences and work hard towards his ultimate goal of having a fleet of mototaxis thereby forming a transportation company.  But that's not all.  Jose Luis also loves to cook and another of his dreams is to have a restaurant specializing in ceviche and he is already looking for a piece of property that would be appropriate for his restaurant and to store his mototaxis.  This is his first loan with MFP and he pledges to be punctual with his payments.  These funds will be used as a down payment for the purchase of an additional mototaxi. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":379443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Down payment on a moto-taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T01:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":180.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":212.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":223.2},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":225.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":238.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":251.81},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":254.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":264.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":272.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":283.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":293.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":298.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.24},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.01,"local_amount":181.49,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":183.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997409,"comment":null},{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":212.46,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":214.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842754,"comment":null},{"amount":210.65,"local_amount":616.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":623.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734335,"comment":null},{"amount":24.03,"local_amount":70.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959597,"comment":null},{"amount":86.04,"local_amount":251.81,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":254.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992394,"comment":null},{"amount":86.82,"local_amount":254.11,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":256.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717232,"comment":null},{"amount":90.53,"local_amount":264.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":267.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751015,"comment":null},{"amount":93.24,"local_amount":272.89,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":275.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933653,"comment":null},{"amount":286.88,"local_amount":839.64,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":849.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672590,"comment":null},{"amount":12.21,"local_amount":35.75,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886467,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T03:28:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":133336,"name":"Batey Nuevo Group 1 & 2","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yonery is the group coordinator of the group Batey Nuevo (New Batey) which is based in a Batey \u2013 a small agricultural village centered around sugarcane harvesting in the area surrounding San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic.

One of the members is Franklina L., a single, 20 year old woman who lives in the Ingenio Villa neighborhood of the city of El Alto. Franklina has a talent for weaving. She will use the loan money to buy more wool to weave. In the future she wants to grow her business by selling her products to friends and neighbors, and she is also considering opening a store in her house. For these reasons she would like to remain a member of this group and try to earn more money soon. Like Franklina, the other members have small businesses such as the sale of school supplies, woven jackets and sweaters, food and candies, and the management of a neighborhood shop. They need this loan in order to buy merchandise and raw materials.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

She lives in a house she owns, along with her husband Francisco who is 32 years old and her son Ubaldo who is 6.  What she wishes for the most is to give them a good life.  In her small home built of adobe, she knits small, cute little dolls out of wool that she takes to sell in the city of Puno where there are many tourists who appreciate her work and buy her product very quickly as they are a wonderful keepsake to take back home.  What she enjoys most about her work is the knitting, an activity that fills her with satisfaction since she knows it will provide food for her family.  She has been in this business for 2 years, and she considers the most difficult part having to be gone the entire day to sell her wares, which makes her very tired.  For this reason, she hopes to \u2013 in time \u2013 establish her business in a stable place where she doesn\u2019t have to travel to market her dolls.  She would like to provide an education for her beloved son.  Dionisia has had 5 loans with MFP by now, and she has been very punctual with her payments.  She has never had any problems with her cooperative bank, where she is in charge of installments and her good humor makes her colleagues very happy.  With the three hundred soles she is requesting, she will purchase more yarn to increase the quantity of little dolls she knits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":379490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":61.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081267,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":61.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997418,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842763,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":185,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734340,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He wants to provide them with superior educational opportunities.  For most of his life, Hern\u00e1n has worked in many areas, and he now has a job in construction.  His neighbors request him a lot since when there is a roofing or someone has to raise a wall in their remote neighborhood Villa el Salvador in the city of Juliaca, he is the builder with the most experience who everyone turns to.  Hern\u00e1n enjoys working in construction and he knows that with this worthy profession, he can pay for the education of his children.  He has been doing this work for 18 years and believes that the most difficult part of his job is carrying the  heavy bricks and having to handle the cement with his hands.  This has caused his hands to age quickly, and he hopes to renew his tools in order to improve the job he is doing.  This is Hern\u00e1n's fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP and he does not want to miss payment for lack of money so he is already making contacts to get more construction work.  He is the only male from the communal bank, so he already tries to be responsible and respectful with the other female members.  With the 800 new requested soles, he will purchase new lumber and increase the number of props.  With these he will be able to work on more construction jobs at the same time and therefore increase his income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":379496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"The purchase of construction tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":135.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081269,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":135.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997420,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":135.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842765,"comment":null},{"amount":137.84,"local_amount":401,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":408.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734342,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He is married, lives in his own home, and is the father of 4 children who live elsewhere.  He has dedicated his entire life to agriculture and has the satisfaction of knowing that none of his crops have ever failed.  This was how he was able to provide his children with an education that enabled them to develop into good people, and not become financially dependent on him.  \r\n<p>\r\nFortunato, despite his age, has no intentions to quit farming.  To the contrary, he plans to keep on planting and harvesting his crops.  The thought that he may not be able to continue farming fills him with sadness and makes him physically ill.  He continues to plant potatoes, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulloco<\/a>, and peas.  His crops are sold at the wholesale market in Tarma, where buyers will pay between 40 to 60 soles per bag depending on the size and variety.

They have been able to support their family throughout the years by cultivating potatoes, peas, beans, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulloco<\/a>.  In addition, they raise dairy cows so that they can obtain 3 to 4 buckets of milk each day to produce their rich cheeses, which are well-known among customers for their flavor.  They sell their products in Lima every 2 weeks.  Gaudencio already has regular customers in Lima, which is why he prepares between 40 to 60 blocks of cheese so that he can fulfill his orders.  He sells the rest of his cheese in Tarma at the \u201cDos de Mayo\u201d (May 2) Market, where products are sold at retail.

They are her greatest treasure, and she wishes to help them with the various family expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe delivers newspapers, which is one of the most difficult jobs in the city.  People are on the streets very early wanting to stay informed of the latest events.  She distributes the papers to her customers at the optimal time whenever possible.  To achieve her sales record of these papers, she gets up at dawn to go the newspaper agencies to get papers to distribute to stores and stalls in the markets.\r\n\r\nHer routine is to distribute in the mornings and collect in the afternoons.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  In that time she has gained experience, and she has a great number of customers who are used to visits from Eusebia.\r\n\r\nHer next goal is to set up a stall in the regional market to sell food products as an additional business, which she is used to.\r\n\r\nShe needs help to have greater income in order to give her elderly parents security.  This is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She has shown herself to be a person who does well in making her payments.\r\n\r\nEusebia likes the enthusiasm her work team has.  It is one of the characteristics of the community bank, which has 16 members, that pleases her.  The 2,200 PEN that she is asking for is to buy more newspapers in order to increase customers in her region.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":379551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2200,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081280,"comment":null},{"amount":125.12,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":370.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997431,"comment":null},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842776,"comment":null},{"amount":374.66,"local_amount":1099,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734353,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Pero Lita tiene proyectado instalar un taller de costura y realizar trabajos con dise\u00f1os propios y venderlos en los mercados centrales de la capital donde la demanda es mayor, al igual que las exigencias de las personas, por ello que trata de trabajar arduamente para ir implementando su propio taller.

For 20 years, she has specialized in tailoring and worked in different workshops and factories, where she did manual work.  However, she realized that she could do the same work in her own home.  She contracted with some factories that give her merchandise every 15 days.  She adds the embellishments on handbags, which are very patiently embroidered and sewn, given that the designs are quite varied.  But Lita plans to establish a tailoring workshop, work with her own designs, and sell them in the central markets in the capital.  In those markets there is higher demand, equal to the demands of the people.  Because of that, she works arduously to set up her own workshop.  This is her sixth loan with MFF, and with the 3000 soles she requests, she will buy the machinery necessary to produce her own designs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":379570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Buying textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":244.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":256.01},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":263.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":279.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":288.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":302.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":322.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":348.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":362.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.73},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.7,"local_amount":244.97,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":247.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081283,"comment":null},{"amount":87.47,"local_amount":256.01,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":258.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997434,"comment":null},{"amount":90.1,"local_amount":263.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":266.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842779,"comment":null},{"amount":171.17,"local_amount":500.98,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":506.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734356,"comment":null},{"amount":23.02,"local_amount":67.38,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":68.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124018,"comment":null},{"amount":103.33,"local_amount":302.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":305.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959600,"comment":null},{"amount":110.27,"local_amount":322.74,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":326.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992396,"comment":null},{"amount":113.26,"local_amount":331.51,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":335.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717239,"comment":null},{"amount":118.91,"local_amount":348.02,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":351.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751016,"comment":null},{"amount":123.77,"local_amount":362.26,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":366.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933654,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T04:12:50Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":133402,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 45 a\u00f1os, vive con sus dos hijos en la casa que su ex esposo le dej\u00f3 hace diez a\u00f1os.

She also prepares barbecue and sells it to customers. Remedios makes rags from textile trimmings and sells them to customers.

From these activities, she could realize a monthly income of $980.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Kiva field partner, Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative, in 2006.  Her previous loans with the co-op were used to purchase textile trimmings from garment factories.  She used some of the money to buy more items for her store, such as soft drinks.  Now on her tenth loan cycle, Remedios is applying for a new loan amounting to P45,000.00 which she will spread out through all her business activities.\r\n\r\nRemedios would like to see her general store someday grow as big as a commercial grocery chain, so she could help a lot of people by providing quality products at a cheaper price.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling frequently-used retail products in the local community. Mary Fe has been engaged in her business for more than 6 years and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Mary Fe joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Mary Fe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Mary Fe from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Rita N. is a resident of Khokhana-Dobato. Khokhana-Dobato is located in Lalitpur district. It is one of the developing villages of Lalitpur, and most of the people in this region are engaged in agricultural farming. Mrs. N. lives in single-family home with her husband and two children. Her husband, Mr. Bashanta N., works in a government office. She has one son and one daughter.

Her middle son is a plumber and the youngest son is a student. \r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, Sveta moved from Jumgal to the Chui region, where she commenced commerce. After a while, she swapped all her goods for 40 sheep.  The Chui region, being famous for its fertile land, is suitable for raising livestock. Sveta realized that cattle could be her gold mine. After increasing the total population, she exchanged a hundred sheep for a house and has been able to pay for her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nNow, Sveta sells 20 liters of milk a day. She has a stable income of $114 per month. Sveta is seeking a loan to purchase a calf for feeding and also purchase some fuel for tillage. In future, she is going to give her children education and help her middle son to buy a house.

She needs a loan to purchase seven sheep for feeding and resale.\r\n\r\nTalaikul, 41, has four children. Her husband is a builder.  Her parents\u2013in\u2013law gave her two calves as a present. Since then she has been raising livestock. She is seeking a loan to purchase three calves. \r\n\r\nBurulush, 58, raised seven children, who live separately. Burulush makes her living by keeping hens. During summer she sells apples, plums and apricots. Burulush hopes to get a loan and purchase feed for winter: hay and barley, and to buy four sheep.\r\n\r\nNurjamal, 49, is a shepherd\u2019s wife and the mother of four children.

G., 51, is a fruit vendor from Silang, Cavite.

She has been doing this for the last five years and earns at least P4,000 a month. From her profits, she was able to purchase a tricycle and a brand new washing machine for the family.\r\n\r\nTeresita joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005. She is now on her 12th loan and expects to receive a new loan in the amount of P15,000 as additional capital to buy more fruit from the farms.\r\n\r\nTeresita is optimistic her tricycle will soon become a jeepney (a small bus) or a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

She has been running her business for three years.  In the dry season, fish are plentiful so she sells her husband\u2019s catch, but in the rainy season she needs to purchase fish wholesale to sell in the market.  She is requesting a loan for this fish purchase and also to buy additional baskets and bags to transport them.  She is successful because her customers like the way she prepares her fish for consumption.  Her dream is to grow her business to be a year-long business, unlike those who go out of business during the rainy season.  With the profits from her business, Makula dreams of building a permanent shop for her year-round business, sending her children to school, and building a house for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":380242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional fish and to buy baskets for transporting them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

She incurs extra transport costs to and from shopping as she buys the charcoal from Nakasongola, a far-off rural area. The major challenges she faces in her business are transport costs, rainy seasons and intervention by traffic police. She needs to get a document from police that allows her to transport charcoal. She sells her charcoal door-to-door. Her major monthly expenses are school fees and food.\r\n\r\nSarah has been in this business for the last four years and has been with MCDT for four years working with the same group members.

He is 44 years old and lives with his common-law wife. He has 7 children between the ages of 2 months and 16 years, with different mothers. He doesn't support anyone else economically and is able to save 1000 meticals a month.\r\n\r\nWhen Alberto finished 10th grade he did a three-year teacher training course. When he finished, he went to a community 45 km from Namaacha, where he's been a school principal for more than 15 years, earning 7799 meticals a month. Since his salary is his family's only source of income, he's not able to meet all their needs and approached BIM (International Bank of Mozambique) requesting a loan to begin building a house, which he was unable to finish because of the high cost of materials.\r\n\r\nHe then approached another bank, ProCredito, requesting a loan to continue the work, which he paid back successfully. But because of the distance, he has now chosen to work with Hluvuku and has requested another loan in the amount of 15,000 meticals to buy construction materials and finish the work.\r\n\r\nThis is Alberto's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He will use the money to finish his project, since he's eager to finish his possessions are scattered and neglected. He is confident that he will be able to pay back the loan with no difficulty and then request another to build a wall around his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":548.81,"image":{"id":380584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.19,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":681.29,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":690.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056861,"comment":null},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":1472.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1491.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971817,"comment":null},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":1951.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1977.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708936,"comment":null},{"amount":36.85,"local_amount":962.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":975.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":123937963,"comment":null},{"amount":87.95,"local_amount":2297.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2327.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":123937964,"comment":null},{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":1186.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.49,"payment_id":128971950,"comment":null},{"amount":225.67,"local_amount":6448.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6534.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":151915969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T00:07:36Z","paid_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":133613,"name":"Francila Abel","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Francilia Abel S. nasceu na capital Maputo, tem 36 anos de idade \u00e9 vi\u00fava e m\u00e3e de uma rapariga de 14 anos de idade que freguenta a 8\u00aa classe na escola secund\u00e1ria da Namaacha.

Years later he started working as a security officer, but because of the low salary he left the job and currently works as a truck driver (he transports vehicles from South Africa to Suazilandia) he earns 2,000MT monthly and travels 4 times a month. He sells diverse clothing under request, taking advantage of the travels, obtaining 4,000MT monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is Frenk\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first one with Kiva.

Every Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. she sells grilled food (barbecued chicken with yucca and chili), soft drinks, and beer.  Also, on Mondays through Thursdays she works in a small student cafeteria at a university near her house.  She has been doing this for six months.\r\n\r\nJane says that she does all of this for her children.  She has to give them what is needed to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activities a lot because they entertain her and keep her busy.  Also, both are profitable.  The good thing about selling grilled chicken is that she raises the chickens herself.  She makes sure they are the right weight and size when it is time to prepare them.  This way her dishes are more appealing to her customers; they are large portions for a good price.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She likes working with her group.

For the time being, they live in their parents\u2019 home. He is a very hard-working man who has been providing public transportation services full-time for 10 years. Thanks to his efforts, he now owns three motorcycle taxis. His wife is the one who is in charge of handling the business finances because he admits that she is much better at it than he is. Rodolfo drives one of the motorcycle taxis, while he hired two other drivers to drive the other taxis. However, his wish to keep making progress is so big that he also utilizes his artistic skills in his free time by making necklaces, earrings, hoops, and bracelets out of local material in the indigenous zone (the Peruvian jungle). He has an advantage because he lives in a tourist section, which means that his jewelry sells well because he is a street vendor. Rodolfo is concerned with being an active and healthy person so that he can continue with his work. He is very pleased with what he has managed up to now for the benefit of his family. This is the first time that he requests a loan with MFP. Ever since he first got in touch with his microfinance institute, he has been happy to work with people who are united and responsible.
