This is her second loan with MFP and she feels very happy about this opportunity for a loan.  She hopes to be able to repay it on time and in her communal bank she is one of the most participatory and responsible members. With the loan that she is requesting she will buy more hats to increase the amount of merchandise that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":305643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012469,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596059,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990323,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211446,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640949,"comment":null},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T20:08:59Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102667,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cecilia es socia del Banco Comunal Maria Antonieta.\nCecilia es casada, tienen 48 a\u00f1os y 6 hijos, Cecilia vende golosinas variadas de manera ambulatoria en una calle c\u00e9ntrica de la ciudad de Ayacucho, su negocio esta ubicado al frente de una universidad.

But what she likes least is having to walk so much during the day to sell her product.  Despite this she knows that she has to work hard and hopes to be able to open a more stable business such as a grocery store or a bookstore as the neighborhood where she lives is new and still lacks these services.

The twenty group members all live in the city of Cusco and dedicate themselves to a variety of different businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nFernando P. G. is 33 years old and single. He works independently as a systems engineer and works for the international NGO Worldvision, the SIS computing company, and the Hotel San Agustin. His three employers keep him pretty busy as he usually has jobs all through the week. He has been in this line of work for the past six or seven years. Fernando is requesting a loan of $150 to install ceramic tiles on the staircase of his house. He will hire someone to do the job, which will cost 1000 soles in total (US$300); he will pay for the rest of the job out of his salary. This is Fernando\u2019s first loan cycle with the Salud Village Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nFour of the group members work at a local nursery school run by PRONOEI, a government institution that provides daycare\/nursery schooling to children between the ages of 3 and 5 from low-income families. The women are paid very little (one of the women refers to her salary as \u201ca tip\u201d), so they all have side businesses to generate more income. They each earn 300 soles per month (US $95). Hermila V. V. and Maria Elena P. C. both sell stuffed animals at a Saturday market in the Santiago neighborhood of Cusco; each says that on a good day she earns as much as 250 soles in profits.  Filomena C. M. works at the same market selling second hand clothing. She travels to Puno once a week to buy the clothing, and says she earns as much as 300 soles on a good weekend. These three women will invest their Kiva loans in purchasing more merchandise for their respective businesses at the Baratillo market.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia P. H. is 47 years old and married. She has one son who is 15; she also lost a child to medical negligence. She runs a small business with her husband selling communications devices to municipal offices in small towns in the countryside around Cusco. These devices generate radio and television signals. She handles the administrative end of this while her husband is in charge of the technical part.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple has been in this business for the past 18 years, so they are well known in the area and use word of mouth to advertise their services. Most of the equipment has to be special ordered from Lima or Arequipa, says Sonia, though some of the smaller parts can be found and assembled in Cusco. The couple works alone most of the time, though they occasionally hire someone to work on transmission towers. Sonia will use her loan of $700 to buy part of a larger piece of equipment. $700 is enough to buy the cables and connectors, she says; the entire piece of equipment will cost about $1500. Sonia\u2019s goal for the future is to expand her business from a micro-enterprise to a larger company.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group is requesting a total of $4,400. The members have all pledged to repay their Kiva loans in full and on time. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":305671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Install ceramic tiles, buy stuffed animals, used clothing, cables and connectors for satellite","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Nicanora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naciazena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilarmina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dignidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kriss Gin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripinino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4400,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1052.27,"local_amount":1052.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409845,"comment":null},{"amount":1083.82,"local_amount":1083.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918292,"comment":null},{"amount":1116.31,"local_amount":1116.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139131,"comment":null},{"amount":1147.6,"local_amount":1147.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564751,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T17:35:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102682,"name":"Faafili","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faafili I., 52, is married with six children.

She has three children. In light of the global crisis, her husband sought work, and eventually he was employed but far from his family. At first she experienced difficulty and had to make a big adjustment. In order to help her husband, she began to buy and sell fashion jewelry (silver). It was a good decision because she earns additional income. She got her capital from Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative. Most of her sales come from orders, so 98% is sold already. Aside from fashion jewelry, she is also a dealer of Natasha, MSE & Avon Products. Today, she is applying for a loan of PHP 10,000 to buy additional stock of fashion jewelry such as silver. Someday, she aims to have a store for fashion jewelry.

D. lives in the municipality of Hamtic in beautiful Antique Province.  Hamtic is situated to the south of Antique, and is bounded by mountains in one direction and the coast in the other.  Evelyn is 38 years old and has two sons and two daughters.  Her eldest child, a daughter, is 14 and attends high school; the other three children are still in primary school.  Evelyn's husband Alexius is a driver.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn plans to use the money from this loan to buy inventory for her sari-sari store.  \"Sari-sari\" is Tagalog for \"various kinds\" and the shops sell just that: an assortment of basic foodstuffs, beverages, and everyday commodities. The shops retail items in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example. Sari-sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, especially in poor or rural areas; they often have chairs or a bench out front and act as neighborhood watering holes.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn dreams that one day perhaps she'll be able to grow her sari-sari store into a mini-mart.

She has worked day to day, breeding cattle and sheep for several years, but a year ago she started a pig farm that she periodically sells in the livestock fair in her region.  In order to have good earnings, her animals have to have a good weight.  This is achieved through good nutrition, for which she grazes her animals every morning at a distance of 3 hours by foot from her home.  She returns in the afternoon.  For Doris, this activity is usually a distraction because she goes to the countryside to breathe fresh air, and she is accustomed to this routine.  For the future, she hopes to increase the quantity of animals in order to have more working capital.  This is the second time that Doris has had a loan with MFP.  She is very determined to continue working for the well-being of her family and also of the other members of her community bank.

What she likes least about her job is that most of the time she has to arrive at the break of day to help customers, because the business runs 24 hours. This is Luisa's 3rd loan with MFP, she has always been very punctual with her payments and hopes to do so now as well. In her community bank she is one of the most active and independent members. With this money she plans to increase her savings in order to be able to start a store in her house.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":305920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Increase of funds for starting a store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-24T04:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":167.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012485,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":167.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596075,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990339,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211462,"comment":null},{"amount":54.32,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640967,"comment":null},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":165.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080433,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-24T06:46:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102808,"name":"Maisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maisa tiene 23 a\u00f1os, es una joven muy trabajadora, vive en la casa de sus padres, quienes siempre la ayudaron para salir adelante.

Desde hace 40 a\u00f1os Maximiliano se dedica a la venta de comida en el restaurante que posee, incursion\u00f3 en este negocio gracias a sus grandes dotes en la cocina que siempre le gust\u00f3 y que la llevo a mantenerse hasta hoy en d\u00eda en este trabajoso negocio, ya que aunque no parezca, es muy sacrificado, ella debe levantarse a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar los desayunos que ofrecer\u00e1 a sus clientes hasta aproximadamente las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana, de ah\u00ed empieza a preparar los platillos que ser\u00e1n el deleite de sus clientes a la hora de almuerzo, esto hasta las 2 de la tarde tomando un peque\u00f1o descanso, para que a las 5pm vuelva a preparar nuevos platillos para la cena, y esto todos los d\u00edas.

They have 5 children: Irma (39), Jaime (48), Iris (44), Maribel (42), and Ever (40). They have formed their own families and don't live in at home. Left alone, Maximiliana and her husband now live with one of their neices. They support her while she studies and becomes a good professional. For 40 years Maximiliana has sold food in her restaurant. She started this business thanks to her ability in the kitchen that is always loved. This has allowed her to have a good business to this day. However, it is tolling. She wakes up at 5am to prepare breakfast for her customers until about 9am. Then she starts to make the lunch plates. At 2pm she has a small break. At 5 she makes dinner plates. This happens everyday. Happily, \"Lady Maxi,\" as she is called, has two women to help her in the kitchen and with serving customers (they are in the photo with her.) Howver, they can't cope with giving service to so many customers when the restaurant is busy. The business is profitable and she hopes to expand it soon, but she needs to buy a new freezer to keep everything fresh. Maxi is an old client of MFP, for health reasons she stopped taking out loans with this institution, but she is now returning after awhile. Now that her health is better, this loan will help her have better stability, and she likes this bank a lot because everyone is nice and happy. With the requested money she hopes she will buy a considerable amount of supplies, such as noodles, rice and potatoes, for the preparation of her dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":305929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Buying ingredients for making food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012488,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596078,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990342,"comment":null},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211465,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640970,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080436,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996601,"comment":null},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842120,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T08:41:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":102812,"name":"Willy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Willy es un joven muy empe\u00f1oso que trata de salir adelante d\u00eda a d\u00eda para buscarse un mejor porvenir, vive en su casa propia.

He has held odd jobs in different offices, but he has always liked driving, which he learned to do from a young age with cars borrowed from family members and friends. For the past 7 years, he has offered a taxi service, allowing him to make money doing what he likes most; spending the days \"just driving around\", as he likes to  say. He starts at 7 in the morning, helping his clients get to their jobs on time, and he finishes at 8 or 9 at night. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of his job is that he is his own boss, which allows him to decide when he goes to work, but he has always been very strict with his hours because he knows that's the only way to guarantee a good income.

He lives in his cousins' house with his two children; Cynthis, age 15, and Cliber, 14, who are the motivation for all his efforts and sacrifices. Throughout his life Feliciano has worked in many ways to support his family. Currently he has a very unusual job, he is a tricyclist (someone who provides transportation on a three-wheeler). Thinking creatively, he decided to attach his three-wheeler to an old motorcycle which he had in storage, creating a sort of \"mototrici\", which allows him to move his clients much more quickly than other tricyclists. He is also able to access really steep areas where regular three-wheeler aren't able to go. \r\n\r\nWhat Feliciano likes most about his job is that he can pass time travelling the streets of Juliaca. He has spent 5 years doing this job, and what he likes least is that he must work even when it's raining, though his vehicle gets wet and it becomes more difficult to find passengers. Feliciano's hope is to soup up his three-wheeler to provide a more comfortable service to his clients. This is his first loan with Kiva partner MFP. He knows he must pay his fees on time as he doesn't want to end up in trouble with the members of his village bank, in which he is very appreciated despite being new to the group.

presently lives at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder.  She is 36 years old and unmarried.  Being without steady employment, Anora has a business selling various small items: socks, handkerchiefs and the like.  Although she has a lot of experience selling at the market, over the years her volume of sales has not increased to such an extent that it could be labeled a success.

He is married with one mute son who is 10 and one adopted daughter who is 6 years old and studying in the elementary school grade 1.\r\n\r\nBoth Stefanus and his wife work hard to fulfill their family needs. As a farmer, Stefanus leans upon his harvest to generate income for his family. In the rainy season, he usually plants corns, peanuts, cassavas, pumpkins, bananas and coconuts. And in the dry season, he usually plants some vegetables, onion, tomatoes and chilies. Then Stefanus and his wife will sell their harvest to the markets. The nearest market is situated about a 30-minute drive from their village. The road in Bokong Village where Stefanus lives is bumpy with many holes. It is hard for public transportation to serve this area in the rainy season; as a result the farmers in Bokong Village (including Stefanus) cannot bring their harvest to the market to be sold. The income that Stefanus generates by selling his harvest is unstable, that is one of the reasons why he is interested in the TLM cattle-fattening program. Stefanus plans to spend the profit of selling the fattened cattle to meet his daughter's education needs and to meet his family needs. \r\n\r\nStefanus is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner TLM amounting to Rp 3,200,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. Just the same as Stefanus, the other 14 members of this group are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened.

She started her business with their own personal money coming from their savings. She distributes her pastries and cakes through consignment with her suki (regular customers). Most of her customers are her neighbors and some close friends. Due to increasing demands of her business, she decided to expand it by applying for a loan from HSPFI (a Kiva partner) amounting to Php 7000 to purchase additional ingredients and materials for her business. If granted, this will be a great help for them because she always dreamed of having a house of their own.

Hanh has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business.  Hanh is now requesting a new loan of 20000000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 10th loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.  Hanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout TYM Fund:\r\n\r\nThe mission of TYM Fund is to improve the quality & life of

Doniyor has a flock of livestock consisting of approximately forty sheep and twenty goats.  His wife is a housewife, but in her free time, she works processing wool and knitting various warm things.  She sells these things to neighbors or relatives.  Every morning, Doniyor drives the flock to the mountains, grazes them, and drives them back in the evening.  Doniyor does not currently own any cattle, but Doniyor wants to buy two average bulls with this new loan.  After fattening them three to four months, he can sell them for very good price.

He is married and has a daughter and a son. His wife does not work. She keeps the house, cares for the children, and, as much as possible, feeds the cattle.  Umarjon works fattening and selling cattle. Umarjon buys cattle at the beginning of spring, since prices then are low.  Additionally, fattening cattle is not expensive.   The cattle eat mountain grass, so Umarjon does not buy hay for his cattle.  After four months, city people will start buying cattle.  Then Umarjon will sell his cattle.

Until that business grows, she is also venturing into a buying and selling business. Banana and coconut planters are common in her area, but they find it difficult to transport their products to the market because it is so far away. Having this opportunity, Rita built a hut where she could put a bulk stock of copra products. Now most of her neighbors sell their bananas and copra to her at a lower price. Rita then becomes the wholesaler of these banana and copra products in the city. \r\n<p>\r\nEven with the growth she has already seen in this business, Rita still wants to increase her sales and earn more to support the needs of her grandsons and granddaughters, who are still in school.

","en":"Nurmat M. was born in 1977.  He is married and has five children.  Although he did not complete any sort of higher education, Nurmat has several goats and sheep in his yard.

H. is a villager living in Siem Reap Province in Cambodia, where he has been settled with his family members for years. He is currently providing for his family by driving a motor taxi, with which he can generate a stable income of $3 a day. To help meet the family's needs a little better, his wife is raising pigs for sale. Chak H. and his wife have eight children who are of school age.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a truck, which allows him to carry his goods from the neighboring city every month. Muhamadali also provides transportation services on his truck. \n\nMuhamadali dreams of his children becoming educated people, and he is working hard toward this end. As a result, the business generates significant income, allowing him supporting his family. \n\nCurrently, Muhamadali needs to purchase more clothing and shoes for expanding his business. For this purpose, he is requesting $1,500.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Azamat is a 26 year old, is married and has a child. Azamat owns a grocery store and provides for his family with the revenue generated by it.\n\nHe is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to increase his stock. Azamat is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.    \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Atoullo is a 29-year-old man who is married and has two children. Atoullo\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life so that he can get ahead and fulfill his goals.\n\nHe is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Dushanbe City in search of customers. He has owned his business for two years. \n\nToday, Atoullo is planning to replace the fuel supply system of his taxi with one using liquified gas, as the gas is cheaper than petrol (gasoline). For this purpose he wants to borrow $800.\n\nHe sincerely thanks Kiva and all its lenders for making this help possible.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shernazar has been a livestock farmer since 2004. He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has two children who need him to support them and to provide a proper education for them. Shernazar has improved his financial situation considering that his father is also a cattle breeder. From childhood he has gained rich experience in the livestock business. His biggest dream now is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivatives (such as dairy products) to the surrounding community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. Shernazar is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. lives with her teenage daughter in the Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her husband has been working in South Korea with a work contract, for the last four years. It is quite common in Mongolia to go to South Korea and work. The work does not usually require any skills or language fluency and pays better than many other alternatives in Mongolia. These Mongolian contract workers usually work in construction and heavy manufacturing. In 2007, Ariunaa launched a small business in making women's bags with remitted money from her husband. In the beginning, she started making small bags for cosmetics and leather book covers. She went to local markets to promote and sell her bags.

B. is 44, married, and the father of three. He has one son who is a 19-year-old university student. His two daughters go to elementary school. Dorjpalam's family lives in a \"ger\" (nomadic Mongolian tent) district in Arhanghay, one of Mongolia's central provinces. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, together with his spouse Bulgantamir, he started running a family business selling dairy products by going door to door. Then in 2008, they rented a food stall at the local food market \"Terh\" that sells products such as flour, rice, and a variety of vegetables.

","en":"Toshpulot's business is buying, raising and re-selling livestock.  Like all village men, he would like to increase the number of animals he owns.  Toshpulot is 52 years old and has five children.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and their children in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali).  She very quickly dropped out of school to work in commerce with her mother, who used to sell peanuts.  After several years at her mother\u2019s side, she was able to master commerce and eventually advance on her own.  She started by selling beauty products but decided in the end to get situated in the making and selling of local soaps.  This has been her work for three years, and she enjoys a large customer base and a reputation surpassing the confines of her district where she lives.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo make soap, she needs 10 kg of caustic soda plus 5 kg of iodized salt.  Then she mixes the elements with the aid of a large ladle for an hour until a soapy paste is obtained.  Once it is cooled and dried (over a few hours), it is formed into balls to be sold.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to perpetuate her business, she has turned towards Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 42 months.  After five solidarity loans and one individual loan, she is now on her second individual loan in the amount of 400,000 francs CFA.  She intends to use it to obtain an empty barrel, two bath tubs, and 40 kg of caustic soda.  Supplies of raw materials are gotten locally, and sales are made at the retail level to customers composed primarily of women, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will enable her to cover certain family expenses, especially those of the children.  Her ambition is to sell shoes concurrently.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the M\u00e9dine district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Having dropped out of school very early on for societal reasons, she started a business only after her marriage and with the goal of supporting her husband (even though he has a high position in the administration) in meeting family needs.  She did several kinds of work, such as selling condiments and fruit.  She opted in the end for commerce in clothing and shoes.  She has been in this business for 27 years working out of her house or going door-to-door.  Bestowed with a large customer base composed mostly of educated women, she has become a great retail merchant in M\u00e9dine due to her dynamism and her high-end clothing. \r\n<p>\r\nFrom the perspective of satisfying her customers indefinitely, she has turned towards Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 48 months.  After four solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan in the amount of 500,000 francs CFA.  She intends to use the loan to buy fifty bolts of Wax <i>pagne<\/i> cloth in Burkina Faso.  She makes her sales at the retail level and accepts cash and credit. \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used to cover certain family expenses (to buy soap, charcoal, and children's clothing) and to honor her debts.

She is 47 years old and a widow with three children. She completed a college education. She has always been a middle school teacher, but after her husband's death five years ago she started a business as well, selling rice at Gissar's Somon Market. In this season of the year rice prices rise, so she decided to apply for a loan to buy a reserve of rice. This will help her maintain prices until the new harvest so she doesn't lose customers. Her eldest son is also a middle school teacher.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

He is well-known in his neighborhood and beyond because of the palm oil and vegetable oil that he regularly delivers to his customers. He also sells sacks of maize and manioc. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Paulin started up his business in 1988, opening a little shop that prospered and earning him a working capital of US$ 2,000 by 1991. He was a victim of the pillaging in Kinshasa between 1991 and 1993, which destroyed and closed down his little store. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter things got back to normal, Paulin got his business going again in 1996 with a working capital of US$ 400, buying 1 sack of rice, some wheat flour, bars of soap, etc. His business went into a decline in 1999 when the currency was changed from \u00ab  Zaire \u00bb to \u00ab Franc Congolais \u00bb. Despite these problems and sudden losses, Paulin worked hard to keep his business going. From 2000-2009, he diversified his business, adding the sale of palm and vegetable oils. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWishing to find a more permanent financial aide so as to develop his business, Paulin decided to join one of the groups of IMF Hope RDC in August 2008. He has received 3 loans which he has completely reimbursed. The loan received this April has allowed him to buy 5 sacks of manioc.  Presently his working capital stands at US$ 300. His business generates a weekly profit of US$ 50. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPaulin dreams of buying some trucks one day, so as to transport other merchants' goods. He is 40, married, and the father of 4 children between 6 and 16, of whom 3 are enrolled in school.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Marceline lives in a mountainous area to the west of Kinshasa, where she works at her small business selling salted fish.  Besides selling fish, she also sells <i>chikwangues<\/i> (a kind of bread made of cassava flour).  Sometimes, her customers eat these foods on site or take them home.  Basically, she\u2019s in the midst of starting up a mini-restaurant.  Right now, her capital amounts to $72.  She started her business in 2000 with $15 of initial capital that had enabled her to buy some charcoal to resell.  Her business prospered through 2006.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarceline\u2019s ill health, caused by a surgery undergone in 2006-2007, prevented her from doing commerce fully.  In the second half of 2007 through today, she started back up again by including fresh fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined one of groups of the micro-finance institution HOPE named \u201cJoyce\u201d in February 2008 with the goal of receiving renewable financial support for developing her business.

Since she was young she has worked selling a variety of products as she had to assume responsibility for the education of her children, who now care for her in their adulthood. She still has the strength to keep working, so 4 years ago she began selling food in the market near her home. She had to sacrifice a great deal to get this market spot, as it is not easy to have a location to sell where the municipality will not interfere. Due to this, she makes sales from her little food car every day from noon until 3 pm. To accomplish this, she must wake up very early in order to make the necessary purchases and prepare the food. Despite having a sales place to count on, Francisca's hope is to improve her service more and more. \r\nShe is one of the founders of her village bank, where she feels very happy. The members try to help one another with the problems that come up for each of them. The money she has requested will be invested in purchasing cooking utensils and supplies to increase the quantity of dishes provided to satisfy her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":306827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchasing utensils and supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T07:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":301.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":309.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":326.07},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":339.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":353.8},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":369.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.03},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.03,"local_amount":301.63,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":302.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596089,"comment":null},{"amount":100.6,"local_amount":309.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":310.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990353,"comment":null},{"amount":105.97,"local_amount":326.07,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":326.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211477,"comment":null},{"amount":110.22,"local_amount":339.13,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":339.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640982,"comment":null},{"amount":114.99,"local_amount":353.8,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":354.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080448,"comment":null},{"amount":120.19,"local_amount":369.83,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":370.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996607,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T10:03:10Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103088,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia SONIA; Es natural del distrito de Chincheros, ubicado en la provincia de Urubamba en el departamento del Cusco, situado a 1 hora de la ciudad en transporte p\u00fablico.\n\nNuestra socia alterna sus actividades dom\u00e9sticas con el comercio minorista, ella cr\u00eda animales menores (cuyes, pollos, patos, gallinas, cerdos, ovejas), para su venta posterior y compra granos secos para venderlos en el mercado dominical; por lo que la socia requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para implementar sus animales y comprar granos.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 muy agradecida por el apoyo brindado y de la misma manera se compromete a cumplir con el pago de su pr\u00e9stamo en el plazo estipulado.\n\n","en":"Partner SONIA: She is a local of Chincheros district, located in the Urubamba province in the department of Cusco, situated one hour from the city by public transport.\r\n\r\nOur partner alternates her domestic and retail activities.

From a very young age he learned the cobbling business and with time he specialized his skill and improved the quality of his work.  He has worked as a cobbler for 25 years.  Thanks to his speediness and efficiency, the people in his neighborhood always ask for his services, but because he lacks appropriate tools, he can't attend to all of his clients.  This is due to a health problem that left him unable to work for a year and caused some financial problems in the home.  But now he has recovered and, little by little, works so that his small shoe shop is once again able to attend to all his clients.  Hugo does not only want to remodel, but also wants to be able to make new styles of shoes for all ages and in the future have a store where he can sell the many models of shoes that he makes.  He is the founding member of his group.  Six years ago MFP encouraged him and others to improve their businesses and since then he has worked responsibly along with his partners, with whom he has come to share different past times, thus strengthening their friendship.

His vitality helps him every day to work and protect his family, which is comprised of his wife and their two daughters.  His family lives together in a small house.  The experience he had when he was younger caused him to work solely in public transportation.  He works from 4:00 pm until the early hours of the morning, according to his work schedule from the transportation company for whom he was worked for more than 10 years.  The disagreeable aspects of his job as a driver are that it causes him some physical discomfort and he does not have much time to rest.  However he has to work for the well being of his family.  He has thought of starting an extra business with his wife since she has a lot of skill in sales.  They want to take full advantage of that skill by putting a store in their home, as there is a scarcity of that type of business in their  neighborhood  and a lot of demand from their neighbors and friends.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he is certain this opportunity will help him keep growing.  Furthermore, he is considered to be a very responsible person who will make the loan payments on time.  He will use the requested money to buy parts for his car and some products to begin to gather the merchandise for their future store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":306846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy parts for his car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kaimer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220.41},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":224.1},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":233.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":244.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":253.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":264.74},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":274.57},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":284.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.63,"local_amount":220.41,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":220.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596091,"comment":null},{"amount":72.83,"local_amount":224.1,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":224.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990355,"comment":null},{"amount":75.85,"local_amount":233.37,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":233.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211479,"comment":null},{"amount":79.57,"local_amount":244.82,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":245.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640984,"comment":null},{"amount":82.27,"local_amount":253.15,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":253.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080450,"comment":null},{"amount":86.04,"local_amount":264.74,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":265.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996609,"comment":null},{"amount":181.81,"local_amount":559.41,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":560.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842126,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T22:03:07Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103097,"name":"Ekiemute","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekiemute is 40 years old and is married with 3 children.

Now, together with her family of a husband and their three children, she has been able to be at peace and happy in the home that she and her husband recently finished building.  Working in sales was something she dreamed about as a young girl, and she was always drawn to sales.  Since marrying, she has worked in many arenas, like selling clothing on the street, where she had many difficulties because of the danger and delinquency that exists in the markets where she lived.  Nine years ago she had the opportunity to invest in starting a small store, and since then has been dedicated to maintaining her business, always trying to have the necessary products and to give her clients good customer service.  In spite of having this business in the home, she does not neglect to sell clothing, and her customers make requests which Do\u00f1a Vacilia works to fulfill.

The money he requests is to buy insecticides to control the bad parts of his plants. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Hopkins, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":306871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de insecticidas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T20:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El\u00edas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":539.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T21:25:26Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":103115,"name":"Nelbi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La sra.
