These hardworking entrepreneurs are involved in various revenue-generating activities, including clothing sales, manicure\/pedicure services, sewing\/alteration services, and catalog sales. In general, this loan will be used by each individual member to make investments in her specific business activity. Vendors of catalog items will invest in merchandise such as clothing, DVDs, pots, pans, perfumes, and jewelry. Seamstresses will purchase fabric, thread, and needles in order to produce clothing for sale. Some members will use this loan to invest in nail polish and other tools necessary for providing manicure and pedicure services. The members of this group offer their products and services to clients in their immediate community as well as to people in neighboring communities. \r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a tight-knit group with much experience in their individual businesses and the mutual goal of attaining a higher standard of living within their communities and families. The name of this group comes from the Bible. To the members of the group, Arab refers to growth and expansion, both of which are central values for this group. \r\n\r\nEmma Q. Cevrato is a 35-year-old mother of four who lives with her family in Pococ\u00ed. She is also the elected president of this group. Emma is involved in two types of business: sewing\/alteration services and the sale of brand-name clothing. She says the secret to organizing her day in a productive manner is keeping to a schedule. She designates blocks of time to take care of domestic tasks and blocks of time to her business. When she is very busy, her children assist her by tending to the sales part of the business while their mother sews in her workshop. Emma's goals are to expand her business and grow her list of clients. Her dream is to own a business separate from her home. With respect to her family, the immediate goal is to establish economic stability. The main obstacle to her progress is a lack of working capital funds in order to invest in sewing materials such as thread, needles, and fabric, as well as clothing merchandise. \r\n\r\nThe members of the Arab Women\u00b4s Bank are neighbours and friends who have lived in the same rural community for the majority of their lives. They identify the main advantage of the group lending model as the ability of each member, without collateral or credit, to act as a guarantor for other members, which enables each member to receive a loan. The main disadvantage they identified was the possibility that if somebody defaults in the group, or has trouble repaying their loan, this implies a responsibility to act in support by the other members of the group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":674250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"For the purchase of clothing, sewing materials, and manicure products to support the members' individual businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pococi, Limon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-12-22T18:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yendry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kembly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":191829.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":195026.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":198277.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":201581.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":204941.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":208342.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":385.28,"local_amount":192640,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":193487.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428429,"comment":null},{"amount":396.26,"local_amount":198131.48,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":199003.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970570,"comment":null},{"amount":405.09,"local_amount":202546.81,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-04T08:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":203438.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201290013,"comment":null},{"amount":413.83,"local_amount":206916.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":207826.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158254,"comment":null},{"amount":410.33,"local_amount":205167,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":206069.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211231381,"comment":null},{"amount":389.21,"local_amount":194598.43,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":195454.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216510399,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-23T13:52:53Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:10:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260562,"name":"Bertha Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DesD. hace 20 a\u00f1os, Bertha Elena P.

Oaxaca, 40 minutes to the north of Pinotepa nacional. The name of the group is in the language of Mixteca and means \u2018hill of lianas\u2019 (a kind of vine). The majority of the population is indigenous and works in the fields and, in the case of the women, makes embroidery and artisanal textiles. The woman that represents the group is Flora M. C., but we will not talk about her much, since this story is focused on Herminia Nicol\u00e1s M., a 35-year-old woman married to 42-year-old Gracian, an agricultural worker. They have four children: Guadalupe (18), Claudia (16), \u00c1lvaro (15) and Azucena (13). Only the last three study, since the eldest works to help them pay for school expenses.   Herminia works in the elaboration of textiles in the traditional style, which is very laborious, but poorly remunerated.  She learned this traD. from a very young age as one of the ways to help alleviate the needs of her family. She makes her craftwork in her home, as is the custom, and uses coarse materials maD. in the traditional way.  It is very common to find artisanal women in this zone since, apart from selling their creations, the women also wear them.\r\n\r\nHerminia is a member of the loan group organized near her house, and she sought the resources to buy the materials that she will use to make her embroidery. With this money, she was able to buy cotton thread in the colors of white, blue, green, red, orange and purple as well as cotton skeins that they use to make textiles, crystal worsted yarn and the traditional brown thread that is maD. artisanally in this region by hand with brown colored cotton. She also sent to be renovated some of her instruments\u2019 parts that she uses for the weaving of textiles and also to make napkins, tablecloths, huipiles (traditional embroidered dresses), and textiles for christening robes. In this December season, Herminia is filling some orders that were maD. ahead of time that will be for wedding souvenirs. \r\n\r\nThe big dream that Herminia has is that her children grow up in an environment without a lot of need, and the only thing that she asks is to have good health in order to be able to continue ahead in the fight for a better tomorrow. She would like to have a better house that has a solid floor and is a little stronger so as to be able to withstand the ravages of nature in the periods of rain. \r\n\r\nYukuyoo is a group of working women. They help one another and always have the necessary trust so that the group and its members are punctual with their payments. The only thing we can add is a gesture of thanks on behalf of this group to those that represent this industry of dreams. Thanks to those that support Kiva, to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and to the people that dedicate themselves ever day to making possible the projects of many. The women that make up the \u201cYukuyoo\u201d group are listed below, as well as the activities they carry out.  \r\n\r\nFlora M.

The group's name is in mixed languages and means \"people of the rain\". The group is made up of a total of 11 people: 10 women and 1 man. All of the members belong to the \"la mixteca baja de la costa chica Oaxaque\u00f1a\" Indigenous community. The group's representative is Alicia Gonz\u00e1lez Barrag\u00e1n, and this time we will be talking about a group member whose name is Reyna Q. Hern\u00e1ndez. She is 32 and married to Braulio, age 40. Reyna has 4 children: Braulio, age 15;  Araceli, age 13; Artemio, age 9; and Jes\u00fas, age 2. Reyna makes textiles using a technique known as a belt loom. With this, she makes petticoats, napkins, tablecloths and textiles for huipiles [Maya tunics or blouses]. The technique is unique, in the production of threads and in their usage. This technique dates from prehispanic times to the present day. They sell these products in the coastal region, and they are very well-received by foreign tourists and nationals. In the majority of cases, the petticoats and huipiles are for the personal use of the indigenous people, and the napkins are used to wrap the corn tortillas. The tablecloths are to decorate tables. The main reason that they make these products is necessity; the poverty in which they live and the shortage of well-paid workers. Reyna has been making these prized handcrafts from a very young age. Sometimes things go badly, but this does not make her stop her projects. She joined this credit group out of the need for the necessary resources to make her weavings.  The majority of the necessary materials for this production are made through slightly costly techniques, such as the dying of thread with purple charcoal. She made use of this recourse for the acquisition of twisted cotton thread in various colours such as: white, blue, green, red, orange, purple; and white cotton skeins that they use in making textiles, which they obtain using the technique of spinning by hand with wooden spindles; white sailing thread which is fundamental in the workshops in making worsted yarn from crystal thread; and the traditional cotton thread called Cuyuchi cotton thread. Reyna has been doing this for many years and is teaching her daughters so that later on they will be able to create art, thus preserving this valuable legacy. Reyna wants to continue to be supported in the facilitation of materials for her work. She would like her children to prepare themselves, for her work and health to stay strong and for her production not to diminish, for the demand and promotion of her creations to increase. \u201cComerciantes de \u00d1uu Savi\u201d is a group that has great commitment from its members. In the name of its members, Reyna wishes you joy and sends a hug to those who support the large worldwide Kiva family. She thanks the Fundacion Realidad for trusting in them.\r\nThese are the names of the members and their jobs:\r\n\r\nCarmelita D.

She is a merchant of general merchandise. She started selling products to her friends through catalogues 15 years ago to help her husband with some income for their home. The business grew, and on the suggestion of her customers she started buying merchandise in Maicao, a commercial city in the northern department of La Guajira. She currently does not travel because she has specialized in the sales of shoes and women's clothing which are provided directly from various workshops in Barranquilla-this is why her sales prices are very competitive. This businesswoman attributes the success of her business to the fact that she does not just sell, but also advises all of her customers as to which style of clothing and shoes they should buy to be more elegant. Some of them even request her opinion when they buy in department stores.

It is worth mentioning that the group is made up of 10 people: 9 women and 1 man. They all speak the mother tongue belonging to the Mixteca indigenous community of the coast of Oaxaca, also known as the Mixteca Baja. A little more about the community's geography: There are rivers, streams, hills and mountains. There are a great number of trees of various species, such as mahogany, holm oak, the tree of rock, and parota trees. The majority of the people work daily in the fields or make crafts.  Felicitas is the name of the woman who represents the group, but on this occasion we will talk about a different member of the group:  Florencia , age 39, who is married to a 49-year-old countryman named Jos\u00e9. Felicitas has 4 children: Victor, age 19; Jonathan, age 17 who is in preparatory school; Javin, age 14, who is in high school; and Abigail, age 12, who is in grade 6. Florencia has been an artist all her life and makes textiles on a belt loom, which she sells in the region and neighbouring villages. This work forms part of a long traditional legacy of her ancestors who taught their children from a very young age to make textiles for personal use and for sale. Florencia joined her community credit group which is a few steps away from her home. She made use of her loan for the purchase of materials that she uses in the making of crafts. She purchased twisted cotton thread in various colours such as: white, blue, green, red, orange and purple; twisted cotton thread; skeins of white cotton that they use in the making of textiles; sailing thread; crystal worsted yarn; and the traditional Cuyuchi cotton thread, which is earth-coloured and is made with cotton grown in the same region and makes the cotton shirts that the indigenous men wear. Florencia has already been doing this for several years, since she returned from Mexico City where she emigrated in the search of a better future--but destiny brought her back to her native village. The only thing that Florencia wants is to give her children something better, to support them in their schooling and to have a future with better opportunities. She would like the tradition of her work to continue and not to be lost, but to be learned by future generations. The largest challenge that she has confronted has been the inequality that prevails in indigenous communities, the discrimination and lack of support from government organizations. The San Lorenzo group is set apart by the unity of its members, who are hard-working and upright. Some of them live in conditions of poverty but they have smiles on their faces that are able to relieve any problem in society. Words cannot describe the gratitude of the people who are receiving a little of abundance that we can give to those who need more. In the name of the people who are part of this credit group, Florencia sends you a hug and greetings and hopes that you have a merry Christmas and prays that God blesses you in 2011.\nThe members of the San Lorenzo group are listed below, as well as their jobs:\n\n\n\nFelicitas \u2013 delicacy sales\nRaymundo- delicacy sales\nAdelina - fruit and vegetable sales\nDolores- groceries\nSonia - hand embroidery\nCarmen- hand embroidery\nJuliana - the purchase and sale of livestock\nMariana- hand embroidery\nFlorencia - hand embroidery\nLaura - hand embroidery\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3975,"image":{"id":673331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To invest in the purchase of twisted cotton thread; cotton skeins to embroider in various colours; worsted yarn for spinning in purple, white, blue, green; coffee; cotton sailing thread; crystal skeins for spinning and natural purple cotton thread dyed with marine snails","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-23T12:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":49000,"loan_amount":3975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6125},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":496.88,"local_amount":6125,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6138.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691553,"comment":null},{"amount":993.75,"local_amount":12250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12277.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430761,"comment":null},{"amount":993.75,"local_amount":12250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":12277.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850020,"comment":null},{"amount":1490.62,"local_amount":18375,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":18415.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292293,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-23T21:24:16Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260580,"name":"Lucerito 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen is a member of the group \"Lucerito 1\" which translates to \"Guiding light\".

Through silk-screening, he has found a way to pursue his passion and create his very own business: Animal Instincts Apparel.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, while wearing a shirt he had created, Jamai caught the attention of a successful retail business owner. He asked to buy some of his shirts and, impressed by his work ethic, went on to offer Jamai an internship. Within a year, Jamai decided to take what he had learned, both about design and managing a small retail business, and start his own company. \u201cThe most challenging part of opening the business was to sit down and decide to actually do it,\u201d Jamai explained.  \r\n\r\nTo make sure his business would be a success, Jamai explored each San Francisco neighborhood to discover what sold best. His hard work paid off, and Animal Instincts Apparel is now featured in 15 boutiques across the city, at local crafts markets, and online through his website and Etsy. His unique t-shirts feature his own designs and are available in toddler, children, and adult sizes.\r\n\r\nBuzz is building around Jamai\u2019s clothing line. He needed a small business loan to meet demand and begin offering more designs, colors, and styles. But, as a young entrepreneur, he was turned away from banks due to his limited credit history.\r\n\r\nAn Internet search brought Jamai to Opportunity Fund, a local micro lender, and he realized that a micro-loan was \u201cmuch more manageable\u201d for his business than the larger loans traditionally offered by banks. \u201cOpportunity Fund discussed my budget and finances with me and made sure a loan was the right choice.\u201d A $5,000 loan will provide Jamai the capital he needs to incorporate hoodies and sweatshirts into his line, build up his inventory, and take Animal Instincts Apparel to the next level.\r\n\r\nAs his business grows, Jamai hopes to open his own silk screening facility and eventually expand production to other cities. Starting in 2012, he also plans to launch a donation program that will send a percentage of the proceeds from Animal Instincts Apparel to wildlife organizations.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Animal

Humberto tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado, en la compra de cantidad de madera que necesita para concretar un gran pedido, de esta manera espera seguir adelante. \n\n","en":"29 year old Humberto lives in his own house with his wife Margarita, 27 years old, and their small daughter. Together they work every day to get ahead. For 2 years this enterprising man has worked as a carpenter, and he enjoys his work very much as he knows that the various pieces of wood furniture he makes are of quality. He works every day of the week, from 8 in the morning until 6 in the afternoon, in the workshop located in his house as this is a family business and in this place he works along with his father-in-law and brothers- in law. They make wood furniture, and in addition the orders and earnings they generate are constant and split between them. He is very content with this work he has been doing since he was very young, and in this way he can offer an adequate quality of life to his family. He is always thinking about the future, which is why he is thinking of opening a carpentry shop in a new location, becoming independent, as he would like to increase his earnings. This is his second credit with MFP and he promises to make the payments on time, as he doesn\u2019t want to disappoint those who made this support possible that will permit him to continue working for the future. Humberto has planned to invest the loan, buying a quantity of wood that he needs to complete a large order, and in this way he hopes to continue on with his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":674610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-23T00:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":147.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":151.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":157.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":172.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.84},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":124.95,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":128.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463676,"comment":null},{"amount":48.72,"local_amount":132.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":136.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887056,"comment":null},{"amount":51.5,"local_amount":140.46,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":144.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327415,"comment":null},{"amount":51.75,"local_amount":141.13,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":145.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195965,"comment":null},{"amount":54.57,"local_amount":148.84,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":153.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269653,"comment":null},{"amount":55.04,"local_amount":150.11,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":154.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549636,"comment":null},{"amount":57.88,"local_amount":157.84,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":162.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718358,"comment":null},{"amount":59.68,"local_amount":162.77,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":167.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349937,"comment":null},{"amount":61.84,"local_amount":168.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":173.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850504,"comment":null},{"amount":63.2,"local_amount":172.36,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":177.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665751,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-23T03:44:28Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260640,"name":"Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cQORI ORCCO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urcos, perteneciente a la provincia de Quispicanchis  y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

P\u00e9rez - she is going to buy chickens to sell by the piece or whole.\r\n\r\nMs. Eufracia P. P. is the group representative for La Uni\u00f3n de Jaloxtoc.  She is 58 years old and studied through the sixth grade of primary school.  She has her certificate.  She is married and has two children: Yasmin, 32, is a teacher and is married; and Christian, 25, is single and works.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to stock her grocery store.  She will buy ham, oil, soft drinks, sugar, eggs, milk, flower, rice, beans, potato chips, marinades, and Gamesa brand cookies.  Her store is called \"Abarrotes Yasmin\" [\"Yasmin's Groceries\"] and she offers her clients products like ham, potato chips, sweet breads, soft drinks, cookies, chocolates, sweets, eggs, oil, sugar, flour, and rice.  She started her business 35 years ago out of economic necessity.  She didn't have enough money so she started buying products little by little, and her husband gave her money so she could start selling a little.  Her sales increased and she invested more until her store was better stocked.  Her store is located in her house on Miguel Hidalgo Street in Jaloxtoc.\r\n\r\nMs. Eufracia is excited about this loan, which she is taking out because it will make it possible for her to better stock her store.  Her business is important because it is how she puts food on the table.  Her favorite part of her work is when she makes sales and has money.  She is proud because her store was the first in her area.  Before, there wasn't any such business.  Her customers are her neighbors, children, women, and young people.  Her business is popular because she has been running her store for a long time.  The challenges she faces include higher costs, periods when there are few sales, and the competition, as now there are more businesses than just hers.\r\n\r\nShe reinvests the profits from her business.  Her husband and son also take part in the business by helping tend to customers.  Ms. Eufracia's business has helped her family economically and helped them to eat more nutritiously.\r\n\r\nShe would like to make improvements to her home, including adding aluminum detailing to the second floor.  Her dream is to be able to fix her house up well so that it is attractive.  She also hopes that her children will be happy and that they will have professional careers.

The group is comprised of 10 members.  Cristina A. is one of them. She is 57 years old and sells vegetables, particularly <i>nopales<\/i> [prickly pear cactus].  She has eight children total: three girls and five boys.  Only one - a 16 year old boy who attends primary school - is still dependent on her.  Cristina is requesting this loan to buy <i>nopales<\/i>, as the price is currently high due to a scarcity of that product.  She would also like to begin cultivating her own crops in order to bring in a better income.  Most of her customers are from Atlacomulco, which is a place where people from different communities gather to buy whatever products they need.\r\n\r\nAs she requests this loan, Cristina feels very excited that she will be able to invest in her business.  She is a very hardworking person who does not give up in any situation; she faces anything with enthusiasm.  Her husband died recently but she knows that the way to get ahead is to provide her son with a good education.  She hopes that he will achieve his goals and that he will do well and act responsibly in whatever he does."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":674722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables (prickly pear cactus)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1694},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1737},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1828},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1972},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2023},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2075},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2128},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2182},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2239},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2296},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2355},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2415},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2476}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1187.62,"local_amount":14651,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":14672.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403439,"comment":null},{"amount":698.99,"local_amount":8623,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8635.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982081,"comment":null},{"amount":773.64,"local_amount":9544,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9557.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264129,"comment":null},{"amount":14.75,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":182.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232772181,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-03T01:43:32Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260683,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva, 40, belongs to the \u201cNueva Luz\u201d cooperative bank, located in the Cusco district of the province of Cusco.\r\n\r\nEva is married and has six children.

","en":"The following group is called \"Lucero\". It is a group of 9 women in the community of El Obraje, San Felipe del Progreso, M\u00e9xico. The group is one of the closest ones to the center of town. You can walk there, so it isn't far. The nine women are from the same area and they are neighbors and thus they have known each other very well since they were children. They decided to call the group \"Lucero\" because one of them looked up at the sky and the name occurred to her. They all liked how the name sounded. Their community is large and in general the people are educated. A lot of teachers lives there, and some professionals. It is one of the most advanced areas of the city. The members are the following:\r\n\r\n Ana Lilia Guzman C., 36 years old \r\n \r\n Esmeralda D. L. L. G.,  29 years old \r\n\r\n Nancy G. S., 32 years old \r\n\r\n Lucero L\u00f3pez S.,  31 years old\r\n\r\n Aurelia V. C., 43 years old\r\n\r\n Josefina F. M.,  38 years old\r\n\r\n Modesta I. C., 55 years old\r\n\r\n Ma Elena M. G., 51 years old  \r\n\r\n Margarita Hern\u00e1ndez R.,  49 years old \r\n\r\nElena M. is the representative of the \"Lucero\" group. She has one 9 year old daughter, in primary school in downtown San Felipe del Progreso, In total she had 5 children. 4 are already married and living with their families. Elena was married civilly and through the Church. She has been married for 35 years. She lives with her husband, who works in the Federal Electricity Commision. They  have lived in their own home  for 5 years. Previously, they rented. Now Elena, besides taking care of her house, sells clothes. She sells leather jackets and purses and shoes as well via catalogue.  \r\nElena works very hard to have money. She also wants to support her husband because they lack many things in their house. Elena doesn't have a locale; she sells house to house and has customers. Her customers are normally teachers and people who work at city hall. She doesn't walk because she has a pick-up truck and she transports her things.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she asked for was to buy various items she needed, ones she had seen but coudn't buy. She also has shoe orders to buy. Elena's goal is to have a locale full of merchandise in the center of town. If she is able to acheive her goal, she thinks it will go very well for her. With the earnings from her business, she will pay for necessities and perhaps for something she likes.  She also plans on her son continuing to go to school. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":674728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy leather jackets and shoes to sell via catalogue ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-23T12:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":1687.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691555,"comment":null},{"amount":550,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6794.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430763,"comment":null},{"amount":550,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6794.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850022,"comment":null},{"amount":687.5,"local_amount":8437.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8493.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292295,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-24T17:40:14Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260690,"name":"Mar\u00eda De Los \u00c1ngeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles G\u00e1leo  es una mujer trabajadora, esforzada y emprendedora quien labora arduamente con el firme prop\u00f3sito de salir adelante.

Sjemi initiated her business as a vegetable trader to help her husband in providing for their life needs and the educational needs of their children. However, the income from the business was not sufficient to meet their needs. She tried to find loans to run a food stall business and then she got information from her neighbor that she could apply for the group loan from TLM. \r\nShe was happy when TLM approved her loan application. \r\n\r\nSjemi has joined the group lending program for 4 cycles. She spent the loan money to rent a business place in Inpres Market and bought rice and raw materials such as flavors, vegetables, meat, etc. She started the food stall business by selling yellow rice and side dishes. Sjemi plans to improve her business as her current business is running well and she has many customers. She would like to request an individual loan from TLM amounting to IDR 4,000,000.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy more food stall equipment such as plates, glasses, chairs and tables and some cooking flavors.

M. is a single lady with two children aged five and two.

She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that fashion is seasonal and some designs go out of style before she has sold them. Then she takes losses or her capital becomes locked up due to slow stock movement. However she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 50,000 to buy more clothes to boost her business during this festive season. She hopes to grow her business and open more stalls in Nairobi since the target market is huge. She also hopes to gain financial stability and give her children a good education to the university level.

This loan of 20,000 Kshs is her second loan from KADET. The previous loan was well paid. Jane intends to use the loan to buy rolls of materials for making clothes.

She decided to start a food truck because she wanted to make buying excellent food more convenient for people.  Norma and her husband used to grab breakfast at food trucks before work.  These experiences helped Norma learn about this model of food production.  Bistro Six is successful because of the commitment of Norma and her family.  Her oldest son, Javier, is the executive chef and her stepdaughter, Stacey, is the sous chef.  \r\n\r\nNorma says that receiving the loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana could not have been more perfectly timed.  She and her husband had depleted personal funds to remodel the truck, but the truck was still not outfitted with kitchen supplies.  They used part of the loan to pay off the remodeling, which included upgrading the electric wires, adding the logo, and buying a new generator.  The day that Norma received the loan, she and her son went shopping for all the pots, pans, and other necessary cooking equipment.  As soon as they bought the supplies, the family \u201cstarted cooking and didn\u2019t stop for four days\u201d until the food truck\u2019s opening.  Norma and her family would not have been able to achieve their goal without the loan.   \r\n\r\nNorma says the most difficult part of owning a food truck is finding a legal place to park.  She has struggled to negotiate the rules surrounding food trucks in San Antonio.  Some challenges are that there are not many curb spaces to fit a food truck and that the truck is not allowed to park within 300 feet of another eatery.  In order to work through these challenges, Norma and a number of other food truck owners have come together to support one another.  They are all parking on one piece of land and are calling the area the Boardwalk on Bulverde.  Norma says that the food trucks are not competition for one another, but rather are fighting through the same problems and banding together to come up with solutions.  \r\n\r\nNorma believes that it is important for anyone who has an entrepreneurial inkling to recognize his or her talent and act on it.  Norma says, \u201conce you have a dream, never quit and believe that you can do it.\u201d

She lives in her own home together with her two eldest children as she is separated.  Together they work hard every day to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nFor three years this enterprising lady has been selling a well-known brand of beauty products.  She works every day of the week and is always walking with her catalog in her hand to sell cosmetics to her regular customers, as well as any others that she might be able to attract.  She is very satisfied with her work since it has enabled her to get her children ahead without ever having had to neglect her household duties.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with this business, Carmen also sells some household decorations.  Her customers order their products and she brings them what they ask for.  She sells her goods on credit and collects payments that add up to a little more than the regular price.  As she is a very enterprising woman, in the future she plans to set up a small store in her home where she will sell her products and also a range of articles for the home.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's 11th loan with MFP and she pledges to make her repayments punctually.  She does not want to let down the people who made this support possible as it will enable her to continue working in search of progress.  Carmen plans to invest her loan in buying beauty products.  She would like to improve the quantity of merchandise that she has in stock because she has several orders for the Christmas period that is fast approaching."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":675501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy beauty products to satisfy her customers' demands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-23T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":251.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":262.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":280.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":288.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":301.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":315.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.33,"local_amount":251.15,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":258.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463683,"comment":null},{"amount":96.64,"local_amount":262.84,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":270.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887064,"comment":null},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":280.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":289.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327423,"comment":null},{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":288.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":296.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195971,"comment":null},{"amount":226.99,"local_amount":617.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":636.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549643,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T10:04:43Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":260914,"name":"Rosa Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cQORI ORCCO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urcos, perteneciente a la provincia de Quispicanchis  y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is 37 years old and lives with her 2 children.  She works as a tailor.  She started out as an employee in a tailoring workshop but after some time, when she had perfected her tailoring techniques, she decided to set up her own business.

She also says that she is very proud to belong to this group and be its representative. She is from the town of Zit\u00e1cuaro Michoac\u00e1n, and she is 29 years old and is finishing high school in an Open High School program, because her parents were unable to afford her uniform and other school supplies when she was younger. She says that her spouse is a great help to her because he motivates her to study and to advance. Rosy, as her friends call her, sells sweets, juices, soy chicharrones, soft drinks, fried foods, ice blocks, and more, in front of the regional hospital of Zit\u00e1cuaro. She has had this business for 2 years, and began to sell juices and other things because she saw that the family members of the hospital patients didn't have anything for lunch, and she decided to put up her stall. Another motivation for putting her stall there was that she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses. Rosy is married to Salvador, who is a lawyer and they have a 6 year old daughter named Leylan, who is in first grade. Rosy says that he goal in life is to be able to have a fixed location from which to sell her treats and also to sell jewelry, as she likes to design necklaces and jeweled bracelets. Another of her goals is to finish school and complete a degree in law. She says that with the earnings from her sales of sweets and juices that she's saved, she wants to buy some land to have permanent store she's dreamed of. \n\n\nMar\u00eda Amparo S. L\u00f3pez is part of the \u201cFlores Magon\u201d group. She is 43 year old and is in her third year of Open High School. She says she had not finished her studies earlier because her parents didn't have the money to continue to support her with her school expenses. She is married to Jos\u00e9 Carlos who is a carpenter and together they have 3 sons: Jos\u00e9 Carlos, who works with his dad and wants to open a grocery store, Paulo Cesar, who is 13 years old and studies in secondary school, and Mauricio, who is 6 and is in primary school. Mar\u00eda sells beauty products through a catalogue, like creams, makeup, etc. She has done this for about 9 years. She decided to open her business to help her husband with the kids' expenses and also to be able to watch over them and her house. Elvia is seeking this loan to invest in cosmetics to add to her stock and not to have to order them when her clients request them because it delays her ability to deliver her clients' items. Her goal is to continue increasing her number of clients. \n\nThe other 10 group members are: Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Juli\u00e1n C., Reyna P. Esquivel, Isabel M.

His publication, the Gold Pages - Paginas Doradas, was first published in 2002.  Seniors now seek out his publication to find out about services that are available for them.  The Gold Pages Directory is available in three Texas communities: El Paso, Midland\/Odessa, and San Antonio.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco saw a huge void in the availability and accessibility of resources for seniors.  He approached the Area Agency on Aging of the Rio Grande Council of Governments to speak with them about his idea for a publication specifically for senior citizens.  He wanted to work with this agency to build his publication.  After securing this sponsorship, Ventura sought additional sponsors and advertisers from public, private, governmental, and nonprofit agencies interested in appealing to senior citizens.  \r\n\r\nWith the demographic shift to an older America, Francisco\u2019s hope is to continue to be the leader in providing the information and resources needed for older citizens to lead an active, productive, and engaged life.  Ventura is using the loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to expand and enhance its presence on the web.  Francisco\u2019s first loan with ACCION allowed Ventura to build the initial format for the website.  \r\n\r\nFrank describes himself as a dreamer.  He believes a person can provide a service to the community and positively impact the economics of the community while making a difference.  Francisco\u2019s advice to other business owners involves three things: pick something you enjoy doing, pick something you are good at doing, and make sure you research and establish yourself.

It is composed of 24 members united in solidarity to receive loans from Kiva through the MFI HOPE RDC with the goal of developing their businesses. \r\n\r\nMaurice started his business in 1998 selling beauty cream and miscellaneous products from his location in the north-eastern city of Kinshasa. He is a loyal client of MFI HOPE RDC and has already received two loans which he repaid properly. As demand is high in his community, he intends to use the next loan to increase his stock of goods and resell them with the aim of increasing his profits. Each week, his business brings in a profit of $30. His ambition is to become a wholesaler. \r\n\r\nMaurice is married and the father of six children, aged between 14 and 37. Four of his children go to school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":676401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase
