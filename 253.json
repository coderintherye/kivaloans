This is a testament to her entrepreneurial skills and creative business strategies. \r\n\r\nHer ambition in the future is to have her own store to sell these products and to eventually have her own employees. It is a lofty goal considering her current state, but these are the goals that drive our borrowers to work hard every day. One of the reasons Vicente works hard at growing her business is to help her family. She is a single mother raising a nine-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy.

This is why she has always aimed for financial independence for herself. When she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, and she started a \"sari-sari\" or general store, her target was to have a successful business within 2 years - and she achieved this by sheer industriousness.\r\n\r\nAfter two years, she expanded her product offerings from just what her neighbors would need like groceries, baked goodies and the usual grocery and dry goods, to fertilizers and other agricultural needs that farms in the area might require. Now she even sells frozen dressed chicken, school supplies and a variety of other stuff that one might not even find in a local supermarket.\r\n\r\nFor her 18th loan cycle, Analin wants to borrow PHP 29,500.00 to add to her working capital so that she could buy more stocks for her store and offer an ever wider variety of goods to sell to her loyal customers.\r\n\r\nAnalin's mission is to achieve financial independence and security for herself now and in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

All the partners want to invest their working capital in their known businesses.\r\nThe partners appreciate and value the loan granted through these means, and they are committed to complete payment within the established period. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":361822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quiquijana - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T19:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cyntia Brinilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yovanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":678.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":705.57},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":733.79},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":763.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":793.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":825.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.14},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.6},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":461.4,"local_amount":1384.2,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998466,"comment":null},{"amount":244.64,"local_amount":733.92,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":737.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910718,"comment":null},{"amount":254.41,"local_amount":763.23,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":767.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103750003,"comment":null},{"amount":264.58,"local_amount":793.74,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":797.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110637431,"comment":null},{"amount":274.97,"local_amount":824.91,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":829.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118033964,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-21T20:24:14Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126232,"name":"Anexo Huayna Potosi Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Once integrants forman la asociaci\u00f3n, \u201cAnexo huayna Potos\u00ed\u201d, ellas se re\u00fanen en el centro focal Alto Lima ubicado en la ciudad de El Alto. \nUna de las fundadoras  es  Candelaria C., que actualmente es la presidenta del grupo, cuenta que invito a sus amigas, vecinas y familia para formar parte de esta asociaci\u00f3n.\nSon varias las actividades que tienen este grupo, como ser, costura de chamarras, venta de ropa, carpinteria, elaboraci\u00f3n de embutidos, tejidos de chompas a mano, entre otras.

Canjusa, Pulupandan Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, Cheryl started making Ginamos - salted and fermented krill - to sell in the local market. But she found that it was not easy if you don't have sufficient capital. So when she was invited to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, she immediately got her husband's consent to join, and that was how her life changed for the better for her and her family.\r\n\r\nNow her 4 children are all going to school, and the income from the ginamos is a big help to her family's financial stability and security. Her current operations nets PHP 7,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cheryl wants to borrow PHP 28,000.00 as additional capital so that she could increase her production capacity and improve her income potential.\r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer. \r\n\r\nCheryl is shown in the picture cutting up a block of Ginamos to sell on retail.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":361839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

EMILY Y. is 36 years old, married with 2 school-age children, and lives in Prk. Malipayon, Brgy. Canjusa, in the coastal municipality of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nFor the past 7 years since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emily admits that she has learned a lot in how she should manage her business so that it could grow and continue to help support the growing needs of her family of 4.\r\n\r\nEmily has a food stall in the local market where she sells Ginamos, a local delicacy, and this earns her on the average PHP 12,000.00 per month.\r\n\r\nBecause Ginamos has to be aged, and production is dependent on the availability of the krill, Emily needs additional working capital so that she could maintain the ideal volume of Ginamos on stock. She needs to borrow PHP 20,000.00 as additional capital to sustain her expanding business.\r\n\r\nEmily is working hard to provide for her her children. She is using the income she earns in this business venture to pay for the tuition fees of her 2 children. \r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She admits that starting a new business in not easy but for her, the future of her children is more important than any hardship or struggle that she might encounter along the way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

M. and William Walter C. V.. The members of this group live in San Pedro, an area of Ticuantepe. This is a rural area that is difficult to access and is located between Manague and Masaya.\r\n\r\nThe group leader is Ana Mar\u00eda S. Vel\u00e1zquez, who is 18 years old, is a single mother of a three-month-old baby, and is a secondary school student. This young woman has scarce resources, and she lives in a small wood house. She started selling nail polish so that she could pay for her education. Little by little, though, her clients began to ask her to sell different types of products and so she began selling more. Today, she sells Avon and Zermat cosmetics; these different brands are recognized in Nicaragua. She also continues selling commercial and cheaper products. This young woman needs to invest in the purchase of cosmetics and in new products, including hair dyes. In the future, she wants to sell clothes.\r\n\r\nOne of the other two members of the group is Freddy Antonio H. M., who is 28 years old. He has very few resources, and he lives in a wood house with a dirt floor. His house is very remote, and for these reasons, he didn\u2019t go to school and is semi-illiterate. He has been a farmer since he was young. At present, she grows tomatoes and cucumbers, which he later sells.\r\n\r\nThe other group member is William Walter C. V.. He is 32 years old and works as a security guard. He grows squash and tomatoes on a parcel of land in a traditional way. He later sells his crops so that he can subsist, because her salary is very low. \r\n\r\nThis group has already had two loans with Adim, with which they succeeded in increasing their raw materials and clients. At present, they need income to buy new merchandise and to allow them to cultivate their land. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":361859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy new products, like nail polish, perfumes, hair dyes, and creams ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-07-30T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddys Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William Walter","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.22,"local_amount":2024.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532143,"comment":null},{"amount":48.78,"local_amount":975.6,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":995.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963636,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1020.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963637,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1020.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96873805,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1020.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96873806,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-30T21:01:35Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:33:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126246,"name":"Lilliam Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lilliam del Carmen Mart\u00ednez tiene 36 a\u00f1os.

In 2000, she joined ASHI hoping to access capital for her business. Her previous loans were carefully and wisely spent on a sari-sari store (general store) as a primary business, and portions of her loans were also spent on the maintenance of the tricycle that her husband drives. Both of her businesses bring in enough proceeds for her family's consumption.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her twelfth loan, she requests a loan of 45,000 pesos as additional capital for her store and for the maintenance of her tricycle. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 100 pieces of placenta soap and prepaid load for cell phones. She is optimistic that, with the trust and support of ASHI and Kiva, she can achieve her dream of expanding her business and having space in the market some day for a bigger store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":362007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

S. hails from the busy town of Morong, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is 82 years old but the energy for continuing a business is still bursting in her. She is widowed and left with three children. All of her children are of legal age.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, full of hope to have access to capital for her business. Her previous loans were wisely spent in a farming business, in partnership with her son. The business has gone well and smoothly. It brings in enough profit for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nNow on her twelfth loan, she is asking for 40,000 pesos as additional capital for their farm to pay for supplies like fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, labor and other farm needs.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic that, with the support of ASHI and Kiva, she can earn more income and have extra money to save for her future. She is especially concerned for her health, since she is getting older now, and she also wants to help her grandchildren with their school fees.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":362010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay

Her husband works as a security guard.  Rosita dedicates herself to the sale of soft drinks and beer as well as clothing and shoes.  \r\n\r\nRosita has been working with Kiva's partner Manuela Ramos for three years and belongs to the communal bank \"Las Doncellas.\" She invested her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in the sale of homemade popsicles. She then continued to expand her business, first moving into the sale of drinks and then into the sale of clothing and shoes. Rosita is pleased to have become more independent with the business she has created using her loans.

She has been happy with her life since she married Francisco, despite the poor kind of living they had then. Fely and her husband lack the education that is required to be employed. Therefore, they have used their own skills to earn money for their children and to survive. \r\n\r\nFrancisco is a farmer who doesn't have his own land to farm. Other people in their village hire him during the rice planting and harvest season. His service fee is not enough to meet the expenses of his five children. In addition to being a mother, Fely had the courage to start her own small business to augment her husband's income. She has the skill to raise livestock in their wide and verdant backyard. However, because her business income was not enough to meet her family's expenses, she could not use it as business capital and there was no microfinance institution in their village that would trust her with a loan.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Fely joined a group of poor women who share the same aspiration in life -- to bring their families out of poverty. With other four women, she received a loan from ASHI. From then on, Fely's business had direction and was sustained. After a series of loans from ASHI, she noticed improvements in her family's life. With her previous loan, she bought a calf and two piglets. Those piglets are already sold, and she now wants to buy more piglets to replace them, so she is applying for another loan. \r\n\r\nFely has never wanted anything else in her life as a mother other than to give her children a better future by sending them to school through college. However, she failed with her four eldest children, because some of them married at an early age and others stopped going to school and worked instead. Fely's last hope is youngest child who is in the third year of high school and will soon be in college, and, also, her grandchildren.

Then, in 2006, she started selling second-hand clothes at the local market. She purchases used clothing that is imported from South Korea. She pays 10,000 tugrugs (about $7) for a kilo of used clothes and then resells each item for a slightly higher price. Enebish says that \"many poor and vulnerable people live in our province and big portions of my buyers consist of them.

Myrna B., age 47, is the wife of Recolito and the mother of four children, ages 13 -22 years old. Her eldest child is a college graduate, her second child is still studying in college, and the last two are in high school. Both Myrna and her husband lack education, so they have not been employed by any offices. However, Myrna did not accept that as a reason not to earn money and to have a better life. Instead, she and her husband helped one another. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Myrna found an opportunity to acquire business capital. She joined ASHI and she was inspired by the stories of poor women of ASHI. She wanted to become successful like them. Therefore, the loans that she has taken since then are used for her business. Because of the opportunity to borrow, Myrna was able to open variety store and sell vegetables and, recently, she started selling fish. She is courageous enough to take all the risks of running a business. She thought she could be successful because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream she kept in her mind -- having all of her remaining children graduate from college. \r\n\r\nMyrna had never hoped anything but to prevent her children from experiencing the hard life that she and her husband had experienced.

Leslie\u2019s husband earns a salary every month from the government, she has not tied herself to the role of being just a mother and a wife. She wanted to be an entrepreneur and augment her husband's income, especially with the increasing financial demand of the education of her children, two of whom are in college and the other two are in high school. \r\n\r\nTo enhance he productive role being a woman, Ma. Leslie joined ASHI in 2006 with the knowledge of her husband. She then used her loan to start a food vending business. Ma. Leslie loves to cook. She can satisfy the appetites of her children the way she satisfies the appetites of her customers. Eventually, Ma. Leslie\u2019s business grew and she had saved money from her profits. The amount of loan she is qualified to borrow from ASHI grew, too, so she was able to start another business. She then bought a tricycle -- a motorcycle with an attached sidecar \u2013 to use as a public utility vehicle.\r\n\r\nMa.

S. is 38 years old, married with 2 school-age children, and a resident of Brgy. Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nLina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she did not want her family to be wholly dependent on her husband's income, which was really not enough to support their needs especially with two growing kids. \r\n\r\nSo Lina ventured into seafood processing and sales. In the picture, Lina is shown posing in front of beds of krill being prepared for Ginamos production. Lina just paid off her previous loan of PHP 29,500.00. For this 16th loan cycle she needs to borrow PHP 15,000 to sustain her expanding business. \r\n\r\nHaving her own business has given her the confidence and the independence she wants in her married life. She realizes that earning her own income to help her husband support their children has made their family unit even stronger.\r\n \r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\n\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

operates a general store and raises livestock, where some of the daily income from his store is invested. He is already 58 years old and is doing his best despite his retiring age to become successful in his business endeavor. He married Remedios who used to help him most of the time in their store. Luckily, the couple is blessed with three children: Remelyn, Marlon, and Jinky. His dream is to continue to maintain his business to sustain their family's daily needs. To earn further income, Dominador used to wake up very early in the morning to open his store for early customers to buy and not close till 9:00 in the evening. He sacrifices a lot in the business just to sustain his family's important necessities. This is the main reason why he is asking for financial support from Kiva amounting to PHP14,000 as additional business capital.

A. is from the village of Bato.

To make a living, Perlita owns & operates a business making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Perlita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Perlita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is very lucky to have a good and loving husband, neighbors usually say to Felicitas. She is the manager of her own general store in their rural village of Catabban Burgos, Isabela. She is married to Livegildo D., a kind and hard working farmer. While Felicitas is taking care of her general store, her husband manages their farm lot and maintains their hog raising business. The couple helps each other to improve their living situation, to become progressive and give their five children a better living. Through their business with hard work, patience, sacrifice, loyalty, and faith in God, they successfully sent their children to school though their youngest still is studying at the moment. To further maintain their business, Felicitas is asking the support of Kiva to lend her the amount of PHP10,000 as additional business capital.

S. is a 58 year-old widow who lives in Brgy. Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nFelicidad has earned a living selling \"Ginamos\", a local delicacy made from fermented salted krill, for 30 years of her life. When her husband died, she became depressed from her loss that she thought of giving up her business, but with no adult children to support her, she realized that she had to plan ahead and be financially self-sufficient in her old age. \r\n\r\nWith the moral support of her friends and the encouragement from Project Dungganon, Felicidad decided to continue with her Ginamos business, which now provides sufficiently for her by netting an average of PHP 7,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 12th loan cycle, Felicidad is borrowing PHP 18,000.00 to add to her capital so that she could have more Ginamos to sell. The advantage of Ginamos over other food stuff is that like fine wine, it improves with age. \r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\n\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":362133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE BORROWER","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-07-31T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":720}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":5040,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5046.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73648912,"comment":null},{"amount":88.33,"local_amount":4240,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4245.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088277,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2880,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004026,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2880,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848804,"comment":null},{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":2960,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2963.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-01T08:12:19Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126341,"name":"Estelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estelita is now 48 years old and is married to Edemar D.

L. is engaged in hog-raising.

The couple is blessed with four children of whom their youngest is the one left attending school in college, taking up an education course. <P>\r\n\r\nAmalla shared with us that her family's major source of income is farming. She manages her hog-raising to be able to help her husband in their farming and cover family necessities. She wants to further develop her business to progress in order to give sufficient support to her family, especially for the education of her youngest child. Seeking the support of Kiva loans is the option she learned about. She hopes to borrow PHP 12,000 as additional business capital to improve her hog-raising business and to purchase at least 2 or 3 sacks of feed to supply the daily food of the livestock till they are ready for disposal. \r\n

Through the business, they were able to continue sening their four children to school, and she is hoping that someday they will finish their studies in college. At present, the couple is really trying hard to the best of their knowledge to have additional business capital to achieve their goals in life and to uplift their poor living situation.

uplift their living situation from the quagmire of poverty is the main dream of Winnie C., a hog -aising entrepreneur in the village of Siempre Viva Sur Mallig, Isabela. She is already 47 years old. She always believes that unity, patience and hard work are needed to become successful in life. She solely manages her four children since she is already a widow of her late husband Normito, who died due to cardiac arrest. Being a mother and a family breadwinner, Winnie said it is not a hindrance if she works diligently and is determined to overcome every difficulty of life. She remains a fighter and tries not to be a loser in the tests of time.\r\n\r\nBy managing a small hog-raising business, Winnie is able to cope with some of their necessities. However, because of the lack in finances, she wants to ask for the assistance of Kiva lenders to buy the supply of feed that her business needs and to be able to continue her support in the education of her children.

is a cheerful, welcoming woman whom I met last week while she was serving lunch at the house for which she and her family are the caretakers.  Norma has a variety of business ventures.  On Sundays, she sells barbecued meats from her home in the small town of Yarinacocha, a suburb of the city of Pucallpa.  She hopes to invest this loan of 1000 soles in used clothing, which she will exchange for food grown in the small communities along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past Pucallpa and eventually joins the Amazon to the north.  Norma will then sell these agricultural products in Pucallpa.\r\n\r\nNorma and her family (her husband and their two daughters, aged 15 and 24) are the caretakers for a home and office building near the center of the city of Pucallpa.  They live there during the week.  Norma serves lunch in her kitchen every weekday to a variety of regular customers.  Norma's husband works as a regional representative for a security company.  \r\n\r\nNorma has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for more than eight years.  She has used past loans to purchase a sewing machine and sewing materials.  Norma used to do clothing repairs and sew undergarments and children's clothing.  She has not been able to engage in this work recently due to an eye operation but hopes to begin again by September, at which time her eye is expected to be fully healed.  \r\n\r\nNorma very much appreciates her loans from Manuela Ramos.  She told me that these loans help women to become independent, and to feel that they are strong and are contributing to society.  With the establishment of their own businesses, women no longer have to wait for their husbands' paychecks.\r\n\r\nNorma's goal is to keep working in order to continue paying for her youngest daughter's education.  She wants to enable her daughter to go to college and have a professional career.  She also wants to be able to do some repair work on her house.  Norma is pictured here in her kitchen, where she had been preparing lunch for that day's customers.

Silvia has been fixing this area by improving the pavement and installing better walls. She also has Balto, an affectionate hairless dog (native to Peru), to help guard the taxis at night.\r\n\r\nSilvia also owns two fishing boats.  She keeps one boat on the Ucayali River (a wiD., brown river that eventually joins the Amazon). Silvia has used recent loans to purchase necessary boat supplies, including a motor, fishing net, etc. The boat is used up to five days at a time. When it returns, Silva and the crew share the earnings from fish sales. Silvia earns between 800 to 2000 soles (about $265-$665) each time the boat returns, depending on the catch. Silvia also keeps another smaller fishing boat on the lake in the town of Yarinacocha, where she lives. Silvia's fishing enterprise is going well.  Summer is the best season for catching fish.\r\n\r\nSilvia requests a 3000 soles loan.  Half will be used to purchase another net maD. of a heavier material; better for fishing in the winter season.  The rest will be used to improve her garage.\r\n\r\nSilvia is married and has two adult daughters and three grandsons. One daughter and two grandsons live with her.\r\n\r\nSilvia is the treasurer of her communal bank, \"Teresa Ramos.\"  She has worked very well with Manuela Ramos, advancing \"slowly but surely,\" in her words.

A few years ago, she decided that she had to take a stronger role in providing for her family. As a result, she joined GHAPE in order to help her achieve this goal. Responding to this challenge, she started her own businesses and invested in developing her family farm. \r\n\r\nHaving already been a member of GHAPE for almost eight years now, Margarette has engaged in a number of different money making enterprises. She has sold cocoyams, and has also bought a motorcycle to help her transport her goods to market. With the profits of each of these ventures, Margarette has spent the money on her children\u2019s school fees and has also used this money to be able to feed and clothe the rest of her family. With the profits of her last loan, she also was able to bury her husband. \r\n\r\nWith this next loan, Margarette is looking to start a tire patching business in Ntarikon, a neighbourhood of Bamenda Cameroon. This tire patching business will succeed because of her collaboration with her first born son, a very energetic young man, and also because of her good business location. In addition to this, she feels that her tenacity, a trait learned over years of raising her children all by herself, will also provide her business with strength and vitality in the years to come. \r\n\r\nThrough this, she then will benefit the community in providing tire repair service, and will also be able to save people a significant amount of money over the full price of a new tire. Through the success of this venture, Margarette will also be able to put money directly back into the community through spending and employing other community members in the future. \r\n\r\nMargarette first came to GHAPE because of the quality of their training in business management, and also because of the low interest and easy payment plan. Through the success of these, she has become financially independent and has also been able to help some of her children start businesses of their own. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":362269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of working tools for tire patching, marketing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

S. is a 46 year old mother of four.

She also plans to sell plums. She will make a personal contribution of 50,000 fCFA to make sure that this business succeeds, but she is also looking for a loan to supplement this amount.\r\n<p> \r\nHer business plan is to purchase goods in bulk and resell them in the Bamenda market in small quantities at a decent profit. This plan will be coupled with S.\u2019s experience in selling goods in the market.  Her children will be there to help her.\r\n<p>\r\nS. will sell nutritious food to the people in the market at a lower price, and she will be able to reduce the distance traveled for people to be able to find food of similar qualities.\r\n\r\nS. came to GHAPE because of the agreeable terms on loans, such as no collateral and low interest rates.

She has a fruit stand next to the lake of Yarinacocha, the small town where she lives.  Luz also purchases fish from small fishing communities along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past the nearby city of Pucallpa and joins the Amazon to the north.  Luz takes several-day-long trips upriver with a cooler and a bunch of ice to keep the fish fresh.  Upon return she sells everything she has purchased at the port of Pucallpa.  Luz sets up her fruit stand during holiday periods and in the winter when the river is high and purchasing fish becomes more difficult.  \r\n\r\nLuz has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for five years.  She hopes to invest this loan of 1000 soles in the purchase of more fish and fruits for her business ventures.  She will also save some of the loan to ensure that she can make all of her payments on time.    \r\n\r\nLuz is 48 years old and is a single mother of three adult children (ages 25, 27 and 29).  Although all of her children live with her, none is still dependent on her.  Luz also has three grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Luz, things have gone very well for her working with Manuela Ramos.  Her credit has helped her a lot.  Her goal is to keep working and continue to expand her business ventures.  She hopes to someday purchase her own small passenger boat.  In this way, her son could have a job as its driver and Luz would not have to pay for her transport upriver on her fish-purchasing trips. \r\n\r\nLuz is pictured here at her fruit stand around the time of Peru's Independence Day holiday.

Francisca sells beauty products and also helps her father by investing in his business. Francisca's father purchases fruit and other crops from the small agricultural communities along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past the city of Pucallpa and joins the Amazon to the north. He then resells the goods in the city.\r\n\r\nFrancisca used her very first loan of 300 PEN to begin her business selling beauty products. She plans to use this current loan of 1500 PEN in two ways. Some of it she will invest in more beauty products, and the rest she will use to help her father with his business.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is engaged and is due to have her first baby in December. Her partner works at the factory for Kola Real, a local soft drink. Francisca has many goals for the future. She wants to purchase a plot of land on which to build her own home as well as a store.

Clara is from Milagro, a zone in the province of Guayas, which lies in the municipality of Jipijapa.  From the age of seven, this has been her home, although she first lived in the city of Guayaquil, where she met her husband.  They both worked for restaurant chains: she worked in sales at a Chinese restaurant and he worked in a grillroom.\r\n\r\nAfter one year, they decided to establish their own business in Jipijapa, where it has been located now for six years.  They first established a seafood restaurant, and later thought about constructing a second business.  This is when Clara decided to begin a business of selling meats and meat products.  For four months, she has begun her day very early, working from 6 a.m. until 5 p.m. from Monday through Saturday and from 5 a.m. until  5 p.m. on Sundays.  She gets no rest, given that she is fully responsible for her business and her husband is occupied with the second business, preparing the fish and running the seafood restaurant from 8 a.m., when he opens for business.\r\n\r\nClara notes that, thanks to the help of her mother-in-law, she is able to persevere, even though it is not always easy when faced by life's challlenges.  One of her daughters was born with a health problem that requires therapy.  This has resulted in both financial and emotional difficulties.  Clara is considered multi-faceted, she says with a laugh, because she has to take her children to work and has had to improvise a kitchen there to prepare their meals.  She says it must be done somehow!  At her 32 years, Clara dreams of having her own house, something small but belonging to her and her children.  She is seeking a loan for this reason and to invest in her business so that it can grow. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":362296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy restaurant supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-08-04T12:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599402,"comment":null},{"amount":225.51,"local_amount":220.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":225.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035114,"comment":null},{"amount":226.45,"local_amount":221.42,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":226.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947368,"comment":null},{"amount":110.54,"local_amount":108.08,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":110.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789207,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789208,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-04T17:02:43Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":126461,"name":"Ilda Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Campesinas de Ruizho esta ubicado en el sector de Ruizho, perteneciente a la comunidad de San Bartola  de Sigsig, se encuentra ubicada a una hora de la ciudad de Cuenca, su terreno es en su mayor parte accidentado.\nLas principales producciones de la regi\u00f3n son: ma\u00edz, fr\u00e9jol, cebada, trigo, habas, arveja, patatas.

The primary crops of the region are:  corn, beans, barley, wheat, peas and potatoes.  In the lower areas, sugar cane and a variety of fruit trees are grown.  The district is bordered on the northern and southern sides by silver and iron mines, and the southern area also has lime.  Agriculture is the primary industry, and many people also dedicate themselves to making straw hats.  This cooperative bank is comprised of members that are very collaborative, organized, and timely.  Carrying out farming endeavors is the fundamental basis for their companionship given that, whenever someone needs help, they group together to help out.  They also work as a group when there are celebrations and festivals.\r\n\r\nIlda Alejandra Pe\u00f1alosa U. is 45 years old, married, and has 5 children ages 28, 18, 15, 12 and 6.  She is also responsible for 3 young nieces and nephews, all under the age of 10.  She tells us that her younger sister, a single mother, left three years ago and never returned.  Ilda took charge of caring for her children, and says that God gives her the strength and patience she needs to forge ahead.  They are never lacking in food, given that the very land they live on provides sustenance.\r\n\r\nTwo of her three oldest children study at the school in San Bartola, and the other at the school in Ruizho.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s help, who has veterinary skills, they have been able to get ahead.  He works in the areas surrounding Ruizho, particularly the towns that need veterinary help.  Ilda lives in a house they own, but it is small and made of adobe and tile.  In addition to tending to the home and raising her animals, she works selling food at the CREA and the Paradise Park, commercial areas of Cuenca, on Saturdays and Sundays.  In the case of her work for CREA, she has to sleep in a small room she rents near the 27th of February Market because she starts work at 3 am and finishes at noon.  On Sundays, she works from 6 am to 2 pm.  She makes coffee, chocolates, empanadas, corn tortillas and other foods.  The loan of $550 USD requested by Ilda will be used to invest in the purchase of fertilizer for her land, poultry to raise, and plastic tables and chairs for her business.  Her goal is to continue to provide an education for her children and to build a stronger and bigger house for her family.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Leyli is a determined and hard-working woman.  A product of this effort and sacrifice is the vehicle she was able to acquire, which she has rented out as a taxi for two years, which ensures a daily income for her family.  Her husband convinced her to invest in a car because \"a car pays for itself,\" she assures us.  She lives with her husband and two small children, who are her motivation to get ahead despite any problems.  She continues making payments on her car, but by renting it out, she can dedicate more time to her children and give them the quality time that they need to grow up strong in a rather difficult society.  Among her projects for the future is to acquire more cars that will let her make a better income and have a better quality of life.  She knows that it won't be easy, but if starting from nothing wasn't impossible, then reaching her dreams won't be either.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

The group was formed six months ago so the members could start working together to sell their products in the San Francisco El Alto market, located approximately 15 kilometers from where they live. Currently some of the female members make a living raising pig, cattle and chicken, while the two men work buying and selling clothing (skirts, shirts, etc.), which some of the other members make as part of their craftwork. For the members who raise the animals, it takes two months to fatten the livestock up to sell them at the nearby market. At present, the members want to increase their working capital, which is why they are turning to Kiva's partner to acquire a loan for them all to use. They think that with time their work will increase their profits as well as their monthly income, and in this way they can improve the quality of life for their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

Merlyn's husband is a fisherman while she has been a plain housewife, nurturing and taking care of her family while her husband works hard to earn money for them. All of Merlyn's married life, she has been playing the role of plain housewife. However, as her seven children grow up, she's realized that the small income her husband is earning from fishing is insufficient to meet the needs of her children, especially for their education. Since Merlyn now has no small child to worry much about, and her older children can now be trusted to work on some household chores, she thought of starting a business.\r\n<p>\r\nJust a month ago, Merlyn joined a group of five women in her village to undergo training to become an ASHI member and have the opportunity to take out a loan. Her loan is intended for a business of buying and selling fish. Though Merlyn's husband is a fisherman, for the past  two years, the owner of the fishing boat he uses, sells the fish caught to either him or his wife. He's only paid for his service, and for the many kilos of fish he's caught, at a very cheap price. That is why Merlyn's husband supports his wife's decision.\r\n<p>\r\nHaving been trusted with business capital, Merlyn is inspired to grow her business well so she can borrow larger amounts from ASHI in the future. Her wish is that through her business profit, she will be able to attain her dream for her children \u2013- a better education.

My husband, R., has a shop where he sells bicycle wheels. He has been in this business for the 7 years. I am applying for a loan for my husband to expand his bicycle wheel business.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a loan for my group so that they can also establish their businesses. Nasreen baji wants a loan to repair her rickshaw. Farzana baji and Shamim baji each want a loan to buy a rickshaw.

She also sells fruit and sodas. Her shop is known at \u201cMama Japuony\u2019s\u201d by her regular customers due to the fact that her 9-year-old disabled son, Japuony (meaning \u201cteacher\u201d), is known in the community. Her older son, who is 18 years old, needs her financial help as he tries to finish secondary school (high school), and Frankline says that it is a challenge to pay his school fees.  She also has 5 children who are grown and out of the house.  \r\n\r\nFrankline has faced many challenges in her life and in her business. Currently, the rising food prices in Kenya are affecting her profit margins. She cannot fully pass on the increased costs to her customers since they are unwilling to pay much more for her meals. This comes after Frankline rebuilt her business in early 2008. The post-election violence in Kisumu, at the end of 2007, resulted in her kiosk being burned to the ground. Still, she has her mind set on success. She takes some goods to sell wherever she goes, hoping to find business along the way.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":361207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This business brings in an average monthly income is 500 somoni.  However, his primarily activity is the livestock business.  He buys livestock from all the district markets and resells it for good money on market days.  Gafor's wife, Sanavbar, looks after the livestock.

Because this brings him a good profit, he decided to be involved in this business forever.
