hijos.\n\nMirna proviene de una familia que tradicionalmente se ha dedicado a la agricultura como medio de subsistencia, y al servicio como trabajadores de campo para personas que pagan por su trabajo. \n\nMirna se dedica a las actividades de comercio desde hace cinco a\u00f1os. Ella se vio obligada a encontrar otra ocupaci\u00f3n debido al poco trabajo disponible en el campo, situaci\u00f3n causada por los malos inviernos. Actualmente, Mirna reconoce que el comercio le genera mejor rentabilidad y le ofrece mejores oportunidades para su familia.\n\nMirna viaja en autob\u00fas a una ciudad que est\u00e1 a veinte kil\u00f3metros de su comunidad para comprar los productos que ella vende. Ella sale de su casa a las 5:00 a.m. a comprar pan y luego lo sale a revender a pie en los parqueos del mercado municipal de la ciudad. Ella regresa a su casa a las 6:00 p.m. con mercader\u00eda (frutas, verduras, y condimentos) la que al siguiente d\u00eda a las 6:00 a.m. sale a vender con la ayuda de dos de sus hijos. En ocasiones Mirna y sus hijos realizan recorridos de hasta cinco kil\u00f3metros ofreciendo sus productos a pie, de casa en casa. Mirna paga de contado los productos que compra para la reventa. De esta manera ella consigue un mejor precio, as\u00ed ella puede vender sus productos a precios m\u00e1s competitivos y obtener una mejor rentabilidad.\n\nMirna est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo para comprar mercader\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n reparar el techo de su vivienda. Mirna expresa que su vivienda la ha construido con el apoyo de instituciones como Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, ya que antes el techo de su casa era de s\u00e1cate, luego de laminas de aluminio y hoy es de tejas.\n\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo, Mirna podr\u00e1 brindarles a sus hijos seguridad al mejorar su vivienda y poder tener capital para seguir comercializando. Ella espera seguir dedic\u00e1ndose a las actividades del comercio, y un d\u00eda establecer una peque\u00f1a tienda. Mirna tiene la ilusi\u00f3n de que al menos sus hijos menores (4 a\u00f1os, 2 a\u00f1os, y 6 meses) estudien una carrera de grado t\u00e9cnico superior.\n","en":"Mirna appears in the photo with her daughter.  Mirna is 36 years old and a widow.  She lives with her 8 children.  She comes from a family that has traditionally been working in agriculture to survive and to work as field hands for people who pay for their services.\r\n\r\nMirna has been working in commercial activities for the last five years.  She was forced into finding this occupation because there was little work available in the fields due to the severe winters.  Currently, Mirna is aware that commerce produces better profits and offers her better opportunities for her family.\r\n\r\nMirna travels by bus to a city that\u2019s 20 kilometers from her community to buy the products she sells.  She leaves home at 5am to buy bread and then goes out on foot to resell it in the city\u2019s municipal market\u2019s parking lots.  She returns home at 6pm with merchandise (fruit, vegetables and condiments) that she goes out the next day at 6am to sell with help from two of her children.  Sometimes Mirna and her children travel up to five kilometers on foot going door to door offering their wares.  Mirna pays cash for the products she buys to resell in order to get the best prices and then sell her products at more competitive prices earning better profits.\r\n\r\nMirna is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy merchandise and also to repair her roof.  Mirna states that she\u2019s built her dwelling with support from institutions like Fundaci\u00f3n Campo because her roof started out made of grass then became metal sheeting and today is roof tiles.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Mirna will be able to provide her children with more security having improved her house and having capital to continue selling.  She hopes to continue working in commerce and one day open a small store.

She is married and has three sons. Her husband has a store for selling generators where there is high demand for generators. This is the only source of income for the family. Lubna wants to help her husband in the purchase of more generators for sale but she does not have enough money so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Lubna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband to sell more, increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions. Lubna is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead next to his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has run this business smoothly because she has many customers who come to buy her products every day. She typically makes around $5USD per day. She also gets income from her husband and her two daughters who work hard in the construction field with the men. \r\n\r\nNow she lacks capital to buy more products to sell. Therefore, she would like to request some funds from Kiva through HKL to purchase an additional stock of goods for continuing her business.

Mrs. Tep is busy with her work because, besides farming for six months, she spends her time making baskets and other objects, weaving together thin, bendable strips of wood to sell to local tradesmen. With the coming rainfall, Mrs. Tep has some concerns about her rice crop because it is not growing well, due to the lack of fertilizers to spread on her farmland. To solve the problem, Mrs. Tep is requesting some funds from Kiva to purchase mineral fertilizers for her crop. With the remaining money, she wishes to buy some pigs for breeding behind her house.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nJonalyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to residents of the local neighborhood. It is, for example, the place to go to buy shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling individual items at retail prices. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 250 PHP in sales every day. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue to operate the business, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP. She would like to utilize the loan proceeds to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as a result of the loan because it will enable her to expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes her business will be stable and dreams of being able to provide her children with a high-quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members each week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Phann and her husband have grown mixed crops on her land such as rice, potatoes, corn and other kinds of beans.

is married and has eight sons and four daughters. He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary, and he also works in clothing sales in order to increase his income.\r\n \r\nAbdullah wants to increase his sales by purchasing more clothes. The amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for the clothing, so he is taking a loan from FATEN. When Abdullah gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more clothes and will have a larger collection to sell. This will increase his income and help him provide better life conditions for his family.\r\n \r\nAbdullah is photographed in the place where he sells clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
