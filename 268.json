Pedro de Macoris in the Southeast of the Dominican Republic. Here she makes her home in a small house made of wood walls, tin roof and concrete floor with her husband and three children aged 14, 10 and 5. In this area of town, she says that electricity is unreliable and the water delivery can sometimes stop for \"two days at a time.\" \r\n\r\nYoseli's business is selling clothes in the street and with this loan, her second from Esperanza, she plans to purchase more blouses, jeans and women's shoes to sell to her clients. She says that she is ready to expand her offerings because she has developed a good clientele base and she always sells her clothing rapidly. With the profits she gains from this loan she plans to improve her home by adding a water pump to deliver water at all times as well as to replace the wooden walls with concrete walls (always a good idea in hurricane-prone and termite-infested Carribean islands). Additionally, she would like to continue investing in her children's education and, if possible, to purchase a computer for them to learn on. Her long-term dream is to build a second story for her home and to give a good life to her children, whom she hopes will be successful enough to support her in her old age. She thanks you all for your support.

Looking for a way to work flexibly from home while supporting their family, Dan and his wife started their business at their dining room table. A little over five years later, with five children and another on the way, Dan's business, iZon Greetings, has \"grown tremendously beyond expectations\". It is truly a family-run enterprise - in addition to six employees, every member of Dan's family contributes in some way, from design and photography to marketing and operations.\r\n\r\niZon Greetings (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.izongreetings.com\">www.izongreetings.com<\/a>) provides a way for busy professionals to stay in touch with family and friends they hold dear. Over the years, Dan's business has grown from buying other wholesale cards to producing their own cards, selling them to 84 outlets in the U.S. and Canada. Dan prides himself on helping out other greeting card manufacturers by giving them free consultations on how to grow their business as he has. He is also dedicated to giving his employees the flexibility they need to meet their family's needs first, a value he holds of utmost importance in his own life.\r\n\r\nDan came to ACCION USA because he was inspired by Kiva. He sees Kiva as an incredible opportunity to connect real people starting businesses, and an \"awesome\" gift for kids in lieu of the latest phone, clothes, or game. Dan truly believes in the power of the American Dream - that sense that small businesses have made the U.S. what it is, and have the power to change an entrepreneur's life. Accordingly, he wants to do his part to spread the word about Kiva.\r\n\r\nHe plans to use this loan to bring his business into \"the Internet age\". It will pay for a rehaul of their computer and software systems, which haven't changed since the business was started, and for Web design services. iZon is also currently partnering with another organization called Hope is in the Cards that plans to spread the idea of \"hope\" to people experiencing rough economic times by sending greeting

There is also a stone face carved in a mountain by the Inca. It is a beautiful place that is always visited by local and international tourists. Our members are happy to have inherited the culture and traditions of the Inca, and they carry the honor and the pride of Inga Pirca in their daily lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThe communal bank \"La Inmaculada\" is formed by a group of 10 men and women, who are all ready to overcome and move forward little by little. We have some of their stories here.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther Yolanda L. P. is a member of the bank She lives in Inga Pirca, and is 22 years old. She has lived with a partner for one year. She has three children who are 6, 4, and 1 year old. Her first son is in the community school. They do not have their own home; they live in a house that a family member is lending them for a while. Her husband is a chauffeur, and supports her in everything. She says he is a pillar in her life.\r\n<p>\r\nEsther works as a domestic employee in the city center, and in the little time that she has at home, she raises chickens and guinea pigs.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she is interested in the benefits she can receive as a member of the Espoir Foundation. With this loan she is going to start a chicken coop, so that she can stop working for other people and dedicate herself to her children and her business. Her dream is to have her own home.\r\n<p>\r\n Mariana de Jes\u00fas V. lives in the Santa B\u00e1rbara neighborhood in the Santa Ana parish, 40 minutes outside of Cuenca. She is 43 years old, and is the single mother of 5 children who are 22, 19, 14, 6, 3 months. The first two are not recognized by their father and have their own home. The younger three are recognized by their father, but he does not help them with anything. Her 14-year-old son often takes care of the house until Mariana comes home from work. They live in their own adobe house, which is an advantage.\r\n<p>\r\nMariana works as a domestic employee in the center of the city. She also raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she feeds before and after work.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan. She learned about the benefits and opportunities of the Espoir Foundation thanks to a friend who invited her to be part of the communal bank. With the loan, she will get a chicken hatchery so she can have her own business and improve the quality of life of her family, to help them move forward like she has been doing.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to have a brick house, so they can live comfortably without worrying about the winter, and give her children a better life.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha Adriana L. is another member of the bank. She lives in Inga Pirca, in a beautiful place in the Ca\u00f1ar area. She is 21 years old, and lives with her partner of five years, and they get along very well. She has two children, who are 3 and 1 and a half. Her husband works in construction, and they have their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nMartha is a domestic employee from Monday to Friday. On weekends she works on her business. She raises pigs, chickens, and guinea pigs, although her guinea pigs recently died. Now she is trying to recover from that loss. She also slaughtered a pig from her farm, and she sold the raw meat by the pound. She says that sales are good.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan, and she feels happy to have entered this little bank, because she knows the benefits that the foundation offers, and the members are friends in the community and are ready to overcome.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be invested in pigs for her farm.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to have a store, because there are few in her community, and to be able to only run her business so she can have more time to care for her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

M. is from the village of Montol, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. He is 40 years old. Crisanto is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Crisanto owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Crisanto has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Crisanto joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Crisanto has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Crisanto is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase fertilizers. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Crisanto from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

O. is from the village of Cabatuan, Calabayan, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 24 years old. Charlyn is married and has two school-aged children. Charlyn has a business venture raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting cassava for sale. Charlyn has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Charlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Charlyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to expand the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Charlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her problem was the capital to start a business. Then she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2008. When she received her first loan, she started a business reselling rice, charcoal and other products. After almost a year of doing the business, she finds it profitable.\r\n\r\nNow she is requesting a loan of 10,000 pesos as her second loan and this will be used to pay for charcoal, nine sacks of rice and transportation expenses. She is hopeful that her business will grow and will bring enough profit for her to save for the future of her child. She also wants to improve her sewing business as her secondary source of income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":380982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for

She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2008. Her previous loan was used as rolling capital on her rice-resale business. The business is performing well since rice is the staple food for Filipinos.\nNow on her 2nd loan, she is proposing a loan of 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her rice-resale business. This will be used to pay for 13 sacks of rice and its transportation expenses. She believes that she will gain more from this business. She dreams of expanding her business. She also aspires of sending her children to school until they all finish college and find

All her children are all studying.\nIn 2004, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with an aspiration to have access to capital for her business. For more than three years already, she is engaged with farming business and she is partnered by her husband. Farming of rice is a common source of livelihood in the upland and lowland villages in the country. Since rice is the staple food  for Filipinos, the demand for its grains is high.\nShe noticed that farming as a business brings bigger income and it gives her the chance to save and to sustain the needs of her children to school. Farming needs capital especially during cultivation until it grows and bear grains. She wanted to invest more on it.\nNow on her 7th loan, she proposes a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her farming business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for the metal cover of a handtractor and a motor engine to make it run. She is looking forward to send her children to school until they finish college and find jobs.

In 2001, she happily joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines.

She buys the charcoal from the charcoal maker and resells it in their village.  Now on her tenth loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 Philippine Pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for two hundred sacks of charcoal for resale, and also its transportation expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams of expanding her business so that she can save for

L. hails from the town of Jala-jala, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is the 30-year-old mother to two: a boy and a girl. She is happily married to Rally, 33 years old who is a jeepney (jeep used as public utility vehicle) driver. Daisy dreams of nothing but to give her children a decent life.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of crises in the world nowadays, poor countries like the Philippines are badly affected and for Daisy to depend on the meager income of her husband is not enough to sustain the needs of her family. In 2003, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. When she received her previous loans, she invested them in the maintenance of their jeepney as her primary business and part of the loans went to sewing as her secondary business. Both of her businesses ran smoothly and she is happy receiving a good income that she knows can sustain the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nNow on her 6th loan, Daisy proposes a loan of PHP 20,000 to pay for four tires and overhauling of the engine, including labor expenses. Some of the amount will serve as rolling capital for her sewing business. She believes that, since the use of jeepneys as a means of transportation in the town and in the province is a must, her transportation business will grow. She dreams of sending her children to school, of buying a house and lot and of entering into a tire business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":381072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay

In 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines to have access to capital for her business. For almost ten years already, with her husband as her partner, she has been engaged in fishing as her primary and farming as her secondary business.  Her businesses earn sufficient income to sustain the needs of her family.<p>\r\n\r\nNow on her ninth loan, she is seeking to borrow 20,000 pesos to pay for the repair of their fishing boat, purchase 30 kilos of fish nets and a 24 volt battery and to pay labor expenses. She believes that her fishing business will grow since fish are in demand in the market.

The business runs smoothly and it brings her enough proceeds for her family.\r\n\r\nNow on her 6th loan, Rowena requests 35,000 pesos as additional capital for her fishing business.

fish and selling them in the neighborhood market is not an easy task or business. It needs a lot of patience and hard work. Sometimes the catch is so small it is not even enough to cover the expenses, but Mrs. Rhodora M. is determined that her children will have a good education and grow up without experiencing extreme poverty. This is the dream of the 32-year-old married woman with two children who lives in Barangay Tagda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodora has been engaged in this business since she was 14 years old. She helped her father catch fish and sold the catch in the neighborhood market and sometimes in the wider community. When she got married, she continued the business with her husband. As time passed, she needed more capital to invest in the business and this is why she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\nMrs. Rhodora\u2019s loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon have helped a lot in increasing her income, and this has enabled her to buy two more motorized fishing boats. She also sells dried fish and capiz shells (the shell of a marine mollusk used in interior decorating and for decorative gifts and accessories) - and these ventures earns her an aggregate of PHP 15,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 14th loan, Mrs. Rhodora is borrowing PHP 12,000 with which she plans to buy fishing equipment and to add to her revolving working capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project

Ses biscuits sont tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s ; il arrive que des gens viennent du B\u00e9nin pour faire de commandes. Elle a m\u00eame recrut\u00e9 02 nouvelles personnes pour l\u2019aider dans ses activit\u00e9s. Pour agrandir son offre, elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de WAGES pour acheter 15 sacs de farine de bl\u00e9, 05 sacs de sucr\u00e9 granul\u00e9, 02 gobelets de beurre de Margarine.","en":"This woman lives in the Av\u00e9pozo neighborhood of Lom\u00e9. She is the mother of 3 children. After her husband passed away and she became a widow, in 1999 she began producing small, traditional cookies, in order to meet her family's needs. Currently she has a rather large clientele and receives orders for birthdays and family celebrations. Her cookies are well appreciated; sometimes people come from B\u00e9nin to place orders. She has even recruited 2 new people to help her in her business. To increase her supply, she is requesting a loan from WAGES to purchase 15 sacks of wheat flour, 5 sacs of granulated sugar, and 2 cups of margarine.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Heather

(representative of the group) is a 36-year old woman who is proud to be an Oaxaque\u00f1a.  Lidia has dedicated herself her whole life to working the land so that one day she might enjoy a higher standard of living.  She tells us that, from the age of 12 and being the eldest of 10 siblings, she was not able to enjoy as happy a childhood as others.  During this time it was very difficult to remain in her home since her parents were farmers and did not have the necessary resources to support the family.  Lidia, upon seeing that they needed help, decided to leave her locality to find work.  This is how she arrived at the port of Veracruz where she learned to read and write, and slowly turned herself into a very hard-working and responsible woman.  She returned to her hometown with a great desire to get ahead and help her husband so that her children would not be lacking of anything, and have all that she\u2019d wished for during her own youth.  Lidia\u2019s dream is for her community to one day have paved roads so that traveling to sell their products is less difficult.  During the rainy season it is very challenging and dangerous to travel on foot, and she tells us that it takes three hours when the roads are muddy and washed out.\r\n\r\nShe is originally from Pe\u00f1a Blanca, Oaxaca, and says that she is proud to be from this area.  Pe\u00f1a Blanca is located at the tip of the mountain and it is difficult to climb up and down and, even so, the views are beautiful and the harvests of the area are bountiful.  Lidia does not allow any difficulty to slow her down, however, and she manages to get down the mountain on a donkey or horse to sell her products.  For this reason, she has joined a small group of people in the town to request a loan from FRAC.  Currently, all the group members have their own enterprises and their collective dream is to continue growing their businesses so that each day they can improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of 4 members and is called PE\u00d1A BLANCA, like they place from which they originate.  This would be their first loan cycle, for which they are requesting the amount of $4,250 per member.  They commit to be responsible in their payments and will take great care of this resource.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: (Name, Activity)\r\n\r\nLidia G.

Masi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  Masi is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Masi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":381478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

 T. is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Matautu Uta Lefaga. She is married and has six school-aged children.  Lupe owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community. Lupe has been engaged in this business for over three years.\r\n\r\nLupe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lupe  has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lupe is now requesting a new loan of $375 which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Lupe  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

H. (0) is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa.  She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Malia owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community.  Malia has been engaged in this business for over 1 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nMalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malia has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  Malia is now requesting a new loan of 1750 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Malia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 30 years old, married, and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Jesus owns and operates a motorcycle transportation business.  The main source of income for the business comes from operating motorcycle transport services.  Jesus has been engaged in his business for over one year, and earns approximately 5000 PHP (Philippine pesos) a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jesus joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation, and his ability to engage in business activities.  Jesus is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase an additional vehicle for the business.  This loan will be the first loan for Jesus from GDMPC.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Islomiddin is a lively entrepreneur with a small business selling clothes and shoes for teenagers. He is an experienced entrepreneur having been self-employed for the past twelve years.\r\n\r\nBusiness has been good for Islomiddin. There is always demand for clothing and as the economy has improved in Tajikistan, so more people have been able to afford new clothing.\r\n\r\nIslomiddin is married and has three children. He is doing all his best to provide his children with the best future.\r\n\r\nIslomiddin has requested a loan of 2,500 USD to increase his available working capital. Eventually, he hopes to have his own small store. This loan will help him purchase new inventory and enable him to continue to invest in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H. (far right in pink) is the group coordinator for the Bank of Hope Mujeres Liberadas (Freed Women). She lives in Los Alcarrizos, which is a city about one hour northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo. For the past three years, Andrea has sold various items such as clothing and underwear. With her first microfinance loan she intends to buy 20 bed sheets, 20 collared shirts, and 12 pairs of high heels, which she predicts will bring in a profit that will approximately match the loan she\u2019s receiving. One of the benefits of microfinance is that the initial investment is replicated, because loan recipients such as Andrea reinvest their profits in their business. One point that Esperanza International emphasizes is that profits need to be used to better the family or the business, and Andrea certainly understands this fact. \r\n\r\nOne of Andrea\u2019s personal goals is to improve her life each and every day. With profits from her business, Andrea intends to start saving and invest in her children\u2019s education. She has three children (13, 10, 9) and is pregnant with her fourth child who is due in December. While Andrea has not finished high school, she hopes to return to school and continue her education. Above everything else, Andrea looks forward to a better future.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Andrea, the Bank of Hope Mujeres Liberadas, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International (one of Kiva's field partners), thank you for providing opportunities for those who need them most.
