She lives in a house of her own together with her two daughters and a 2-year old grandchild. Doris starts her work very early in the morning when she gets together with a friend. They set out into the communities and towns to sell used clothing and to buy fruit to stock the fruit stand she has in her home. What she most enjoys about her work is traveling to the different communities because there she can find all types of products which passes the time, and at the same time she also generates an income for her household. She has been in business for 12 years and the most difficult part about her work is having to set out very early in the morning which can be dangerous. In time she hopes to start selling new clothing that will be brought to her from Lima. This is Doris' sixth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she recognizes the responsibility of paying it back on time. She doesn't want to cause any problems to the other members of the communal bank. She is very well liked in her community bank especially because she and her mother are the ones who bring humor to the group.

She lives in a house of her own together with her youngest son, who is of age, and her husband. She works hard to have a better quality of life. Mercedes is the owner of a grocery store installed in her house. She also sells cold drinks. She has many clients because in the block where she lives there are no other convenience stores and she also makes sure that her clients leave happy with their purchases and to make them return very often. She has been in business for 24 years and she gets help from her husband and her son. They generate additional incomes from the different businesses they carry out. She enjoys her work for the contact she has with the people and therefore she is not alone when her husband and son go out to work. Her business also generates a good profit. This is the seventh loan granted to her by MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is very happy to have received it. She expects to make all of her payments on time. She is very well liked within her communal bank for the humor she brings to the group. With the 3000 nuevos soles she requested she will purchase more drinks and she will stock her inventory for the grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":838454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"purchase more drinks and she will stock her inventory for the grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-08T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":467.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":463.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":488.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":505.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":528.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":546.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T03:49:41Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323688,"name":"Bat\u00e9l\u00e9 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Bat\u00e9l\u00e9 existe depuis l'ouverture du BV et ses membres habitent le m\u00eame village.

Her husband is a farmer who cultivates sugar cane and corn.  Meanwhile, Rubia has a store and also a corn mill where she grinds all types of grains.  This is her main source of income, since her husband's income from farming comes at the end of every year.  Rubia's business is strategically located, since it is in front of the Central Plaza in her town.  In addition, hers is the only mill in the area, so she doesn't have any competition.  At this time the capacity of the mill is not sufficient to meet all of her demand, so she has seen the need to buy another mill with greater capacity so that she can satisfy all of the demands of her customers.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL to buy a corn mill that has a greater capacity than the one she has.

They reside in the community of Tierra Blanca.  Maritza has been selling tortillas since 1998 and learned this trade from one of her aunts.  Her schedule for making tortillas begins at 6am and lasts through 11am.  She receives orders from restaurants and school cafeterias.  Her biggest concern is when the schools go on vacation break because it is a long period that she must go without a source of income.  Maritza has to earn a living through another type of business, so occasionally she sells seasonal fruits.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy corn, firewood, and a hand mill because the lack of electricity is a huge problem throughout the country.  With the help from this loan, she will be able to continue working and cover all of her household expenses since she does not receive assistance from anyone else.  Maritza will also be able to continue paying for her son\u2019s education because he is an outstanding student in all of his classes.  Her business goals are to have more customers and to sell tortillas that are packaged and in bags.  With respect to her family, she would like to see her son graduate and secure a good job, such as a teacher, so that he can help her move forward.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other member of the group is Virginia del Carmen, who sells tortillas and firewood.

","en":"Mar\u00eda del Carmen is a member of the communal bank \"Modelo.\"  She is 50 years old, and is a single mother of 5 who resides in the Belen neighborhood.  For 5 years, Maria has been making and selling tortillas.  One of her daughter-in-laws taught her how to do this.  She works from 3am until noon.  At times she relies on the economic assistance of some of her children, but this is a small help, because the home where she lives is rented and the rent is very high, and her youngest child is still in school.  Her advantage is that tortillas are a product that people consume a number of times each day, and so her sales are going very well.  The loan that she requests will be invested in the purchase of firewood, corn, limes and corn flour.

She\u2019s married and has three children whose ages range from 27 to 31 year.  \r\n\r\nGloria has a business where she sells accessories for motorcyclists: seat covers, vests, helmets and sleeves that she started six years ago selling vests that said \u201cLlamadas\u201d and lots of people who are into motorcycles asked her if she sold vests.  This is where the idea to sell them arose.  Since she did well, she decided to add other similar products, like helmets, to her motorcycle accessories business.  She installed well-stocked display cases. \r\n\r\n Her business has been growing well and she\u2019s excited to help it grow because she expects to see profits very soon.  This is why she\u2019s calling on Kiva to pay cash for larger amounts of material to make vests and handles as well as to buy a sewing machine so that she can start manufacturing higher quality items herself.  \r\n\r\nGloria has received six loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo during the last two years that have helped her business progress.  While Gloria strives to reach her business dreams, she maintains a profit margin of no less than 42.9% that she foresees will continue to strengthen her family income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":291.65,"image":{"id":838873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay cash for materials at wholesale and to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Arjona (Bolivar)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Alba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75368},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81598},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83162},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84756},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86381},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88036},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89724},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91443},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93196},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94982},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96803},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":75368,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77613.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803704,"comment":null},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":81598,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":84028.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614781,"comment":null},{"amount":48.57,"local_amount":83162,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":85639.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568736,"comment":null},{"amount":49.51,"local_amount":84756,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780065,"comment":null},{"amount":50.45,"local_amount":86381,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88954.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188459,"comment":null},{"amount":51.43,"local_amount":88036,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90658.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T17:22:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323854,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cMARIA ELENA MOYANO\u201d; el banco se encuentra ubicado en el Distrito D.

His dream is to have his own premises to set up his carpentry shop in a better way, and to help his family financially."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":890.03,"image":{"id":850620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy a wood planing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Gabriel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy Maricel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":118.23},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":120.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":122.73},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":124.53},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":127.23},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":129.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122.7,"local_amount":121.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":122.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227315618,"comment":null},{"amount":120.64,"local_amount":119.43,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":120.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795674,"comment":null},{"amount":122.91,"local_amount":121.68,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":122.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606554,"comment":null},{"amount":125.27,"local_amount":124.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244560878,"comment":null},{"amount":127.12,"local_amount":125.85,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":127.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250771839,"comment":null},{"amount":139.39,"local_amount":138,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":139.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257410210,"comment":null},{"amount":132,"local_amount":130.68,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263314703,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T17:17:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323861,"name":"Danilsa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Danilsa est\u00e1 aplicando a su segundo credikiva, con su anterior logr\u00f3 aumentar sus utilidades, porque compr\u00f3 esmaltes, tratamientos de belleza y vendi\u00f3 muy bien sus servicios.

She would like to set up a grocery store, so that when she cannot go out to work anymore, she will have the store in her home and will not have to go to the market. \r\n\r\nHer husband Carlos helps her a lot in her business; he drops her off at the market and comes back to pick her up.

She is proud of her business and of her work, which helped her cover the expenses of her older children's education, who have already achieved careers.  Her business is popular for the good prices of her products, and good service for her customers.  She uses her earnings for food, clothing, shoes, and general costs such as electricity, water and gas. \r\n\r\nHer hopes and dreams are to put a roof slab on her home and to finish it so her children can live more comfortably, and for her young daughter to continue studying, and later to have a profession. \r\n\r\nThe group members want to tell Kiva  and the Fundacion Realidad, \"Thank you for helping us.  We are grateful to you for providing these loans to us, and we hope you continue your valuable work and help people in need.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":819253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy toys, cosmetics, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, and costume jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela del Volcan, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvestra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atzidi Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":571.88,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6774.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201872,"comment":null},{"amount":476.56,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807464,"comment":null},{"amount":476.56,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618558,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T22:51:28Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323879,"name":"V\u00edctor Giovanny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"V\u00edctor, vive con su esposa y una hija de 4 a\u00f1os de edad, \u00e9l es empleado de una gasolinera, tiene un a\u00f1o de ser empleado del lugar, con su sueldo ayuda a su esposa para cubrir las necesidades m\u00e1s urgentes.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de una motocicleta, pues le ayudara para trasladarse desde su vivienda hasta el lugar donde trabaja y viceversa.\nPara el su primer objetivo es mantener el trabajo, ya que su familia depende de sus ingresos, adem\u00e1s quiere ir ahorrando para poder mejorar las condiciones familiares.\n\n","en":"V\u00edctor lives with his wife and four year-old daughter.

Desde hace 13 a\u00f1os atras Don Will se dedica a la venta de repuestos y reparacion de motocicletas, aprendi\u00f3 este oficio gracias a un primo de \u00e9l que tenia un taller y le permiti\u00f3 trabajar alli. Gracias a esa oportunidad, don Will aprendi\u00f3 muchas cosas y luego de un tiempo decidi\u00f3 aventurarse e instal\u00f3 su propio taller, aunque no le fue nada facil ya que no contaba con ciertas herramientas y tenia que andar quitando prestado y a veces se las prestaban y otras veces no.

He has four male children, two of whom live in the United States, and also a daughter who lives at home and devotes herself to her studies. For 13 years Don Will has earned a living selling spare parts and repairing motorcycles. He learned this line of business thanks to a cousin of his who had a workshop and allowed him to work there. Thanks to that opportunity, Don Will learned many things, and after a time decided to make a go of it for himself and set up his own shop. It was not at all easy since he didn't have certain tools and had to go around asking to borrow them, and sometimes they would loan them out and sometimes they wouldn't. But with God's help and the support of his family he has been able to get ahead, and has bought the tools most necessary for carrying out his work. Currently one of the difficulties he is going through is that he doesn't have work every day. \r\n\r\nDon Will needs the loan he is seeking for buying spare parts such as tires, grills, oil, grease, cables, brake pads, etc. He hopes that the loan will help him stock his business so he can sell his customers what they need. His goal is to stay healthy because as long as God gives him life and health, he will be able to keep working to support his family. For him, his family is the most important thing, and as long as they are together, any obstacle that presents itself may be overcome. This is his first cycle with FAMA and he expects to comply with his commitment to make payments in a punctual way.

She carries a variety of styles and sizes and generally sells to women.  The products are good quality, not name-brand, but durable.  She offers, for example, gravy boats, lunch boxes, tortilla baskets, cups, plates, etc.  She tells us that it's tough at times to close a sale because not all the housewives are motivated to buy.\r\n\r\nJuana says it's hard, but as long as she's making sales and earning at least a little money, she can sell for less, although she doesn't like to leave things on credit because she runs the risk of someone not paying for them.  It's also really hard to get customers, because when someone makes a purchase, it may be a month or two before they come back for something else and she lands the client.  Juana wants to buy new merchandise, so whenever people come looking for new products, she'll have new containers, nicer styles than what she had before and she'll be able to close sales.

She sells groceries and bread, among other products.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for a year and has established a clientele.  However, she feels that she still has to attract more people to her business.  Her work schedule is from 9am until 10pm.  She buys her merchandise in La Vega and from distributors and providers.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy merchandise to stock her business.  Her goals are to stock a wider variety of products so that she can capture a larger number of customers for her business.\r\n\r\nIngrid lives with her husband and three children who are 12, 9, and 2 years of age; she also lives with her in-laws and siblings-in-law.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to own her own house and to do so she\u2019s already signed up for the housing subsidy but she still has to organize herself to carry out some of the transactions.\r\n\r\nIngrid is very happy and grateful for the services granted by Fondo Esperanza because they will allow her to invest in her business.  Besides, the communal bank meetings are very pleasant and the other members are committed and respectful.  With respect to the training, it will help her run her business.  Ingrid very much expects to prosper with her business.\r\n\r\nRecoleta is one of Santiago\u2019s (capital of Chile) communes and is located in the north-central part of Santiago Metropolitan Region.

His other difficulty is that people don't trust that the shocks are any good, which is also why sales are a little low. \r\n\r\nDon Luis's goals are to be able to continue working since one cannot aspire to do more. The community where he lives does not have money for extras.

It is located on a plain with a very warm climate where activities such as cattle-raising, agriculture, and tourism, among others, occur.\r\n\r\nFor several years Luis has been working by renting Fernanda S.A. machinery.  His neighbors in the community are very satisfied.  He says that he started his business 22 years ago.  He had his own heavy machinery, which was an inheritance that his parents left him.  He also says that the project is very interesting to him because he has seen how, little by little, his business is growing and there is more demand.\r\n\r\nLuis is currently requesting a microloan for \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy replacement parts for the machinery.  He will repair his machinery, and that way he will continue to offer his customers good service.  This is in addition to expanding and strengthening his place.\r\n\r\nWith this he hopes to make his business grow more and to improve his quality of life.  His business is going well, but due to his lack of money he has not been able to make it grow more.\r\n\r\nLuis is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal La Garita, one of the 110 member

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
