This will allow her to be more productive and generate more income.\n\nAt 48 years old, this entrepreneur dreams of being able to offer her children the opportunity to study at university and become professionals.  In order to achieve this, she works with great dedication and effort.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.62,"image":{"id":768830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to

Marlene worked her parents\u2019 land since she was a young girl. With the savings she accumulated and her inheritance from her parents today she has 3 hectares of land and she works them with great ardor to make them very productive. She cultivates cocoa, coffee, and citric fruits. The products are later taken all the way to the city of San Francisco where she sells them in wholesale. Her cultivations have been providing her with the income she needs to support herself and to cover the family's expenses. What she most enjoys about her business is to care for the cultivation. She feels very happy doing so. She has 4 years in the business. The most difficult part is to transport the products from the fields to the businesses in her community. For this she hires farm hands to help her. In the future she wants to purchase more land to increase her cultivation. This is her first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since 1974 he has been running this business and has a lot of experience. He started his business cooking the national dish of sambusa (meat in dough). Today he rents a place at the market of \u201cSakhovat\u201d in the central park. He wants to cooperate with Imon International as he would like to extend around his house to be able to cook there and attract more clients. For this purpose, he has requested a loan. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a widower; his wife died a couple of years ago, but his children are his main source of strength.  The farming lands that Leon has acquired with a lot of effort are the main source of sustenance for his family.  He farms this land, cultivating cocoa, coffee and mullein plants, products that are in high demand in the collection centers, since he is known for harvesting very good quality fruits.  What he enjoys most is to care for his crops to avoid the pests that can damage his plants, and to pull out the weeds that grow on his fields.  He has been farming for 15 years, and what he considers most difficult is to transport his sacks of crops, since they are heavy and this work is very tiring for him.

He has a 2 hectare field where he plants cocoa beans and coffee.  His parents taught him how to till the soil when he was a little boy and when he turned 22 he was able to buy his own field; since then he\u2019s been working his own land.  During planting and harvesting Juan hires day laborers that make the work a little easier.  He feels quite committed to his work because thanks to his daily efforts today he enjoys seeing that his plants are more productive which leads to better profits.

He lives in the municipality of Malambo, where he raises chickens and pigs. He learned this business more than 12 years ago, thanks to the fact that he always accompanied his father when he was transporting feed for a business that raised and sold chickens. Thus, together with his brothers, he began with 10 poultry sheds in the yard of his house and 100 chickens. As the business grew, he achieved commercial successes such as becoming registered as a supplier for a state enterprise. However, with these achievements also came great challenges: for instance, there were problems with electricity and water in his poultry sheds and he suffered some losses. Because of this, three years ago Alfredo decided to move his business with the help of a family member, relocating it to a lane with all of the necessary conditions to raise animals appropriately. This made his work easier, and now he is more at ease and enthusiastic about increasing the productivity of his business. He has joined with the National Learning Service, SENA, where he participates in a community project providing technical consulting for raising and fattening animals.

She dreams of supporting her children until they become successful adults.  Luisa's household income comes from her business called \"Estadero mi Padrino y Yo\" where she sells beer, natural juices and fried food.\r\n\r\nA little over one year ago, Luisa's cousin, who started the business, went to live in a very beautiful place on the Caribbean coast in Colombia: La Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.  He suggested to Luisa that she take over his business, making her a gift of a cooler.  Although she accepted the idea, she considered it a very big challenge taking over the business, especially on Saturdays and holidays when things are at their busiest.  Luisa is a single mother with four children which makes things difficult.  However, she accepted the challenge and started soda, soft drinks, natural juices and fried food.  She also asked a cousin to work with her on weekends.  In carrying out her business every day, it has gradually become stronger.  She started the business in her home but currently works in her uncle's house because he has the infrastructure she needs: a cooler, a blender and equipment for storing the beer and juice.\r\n\r\nLuisa's dream is to diversify her business and increase her sales since her number of customers has increased and she doesn't have much capital with which to respond to demand.  Her biggest challenge is serving in her business since it is very difficult for her as a woman living on her own.  Her children are not yet able to support her because they are still young.  Luisa continues working to fulfil her dreams, making profits of no less than 26%.

Originally from Las Vegas, Donna and her husband moved to Corpus Christi 20 years ago to manage another beach-themed boutique in the neighboring Padre Island National Seashore Park.  They bought Beach Memories by the Sea 11 years ago, and have been running it ever since.\r\n\r\nLocated inside a Holiday Inn on the North Padre Island Beach, Donna\u2019s business relies heavily on tourists and guests staying at the hotel.  The tourist season lasts from spring break through Labor Day, with business dropping off sharply as soon as the weather cools.  Donna\u2019s strategy has always been to save enough money during the tourist season so that they can survive the down-season.  However, the past couple of years have been very slow, no doubt in part due to the fact that fewer people were vacationing because of the recession.  These unusually lean times caused Donna to rethink her business strategy for the down-season.  \r\n\r\nDonna and her husband work at the store full-time and have a part-time employee who helps them.  Though they want to continue catering to tourists, they believe that for their business to grow, they must develop a local client base.  They are doing this by bringing in higher-end clothing and other merchandise that will appeal to non-tourists.  To help spread news of their new inventory, they plan to market their business in the local newspaper and other media outlets.  They also hope to benefit from word of mouth advertising as locals discover them anew while dining at the hotel\u2019s restaurant or attending business conferences hosted at the hotel.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana, Donna and her husband are paying off the new inventory that they have ordered, as well as building their business\u2019 credit.  Donna is most proud of being able to offer nice merchandise at an affordable price, which she says sets her store apart from other shops that cater to tourists.  Fortunately, business is better so far this year than it has the past couple of years.  The real test, however, will come this fall when the tourists leave.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1758.76,"image":{"id":769422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Souvenir

Claudia was born in Barranquilla and she learned all she needed to become who she is today from her mother's good example. Upon completion of high shcool she started a family and worked for a company for more than 15 years. She finally started her own business when she received her inheritance from her mother: her shop. \r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to be successful, and that they can fulfill their dreams. Her eldest son hopes to be a member of the National Police. One of her big challenges is time management because her business requires attention throughout the day, and in the evenings she helps her children with their homework and does housework too. This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she will use the money to purchase snack foods and groceries which have the highest turnover at her store. Her shop has many clients because it is located on the corner and has been in business for a long itme. Her biggest challenge is to increase her capital to offer more services and coverage for clients, so that she can have inventory turnover in less than 24 days and earn a return of not less than 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":436.95,"image":{"id":769425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase snack foods and groceries for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-17T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":80154},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81690},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83256},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":84851},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":86478},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":88135},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":89824},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91546},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":93301},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":95089},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":96912},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":98764}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.49},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.95,"local_amount":80154,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":81352.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509490,"comment":null},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":81690,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":82911.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673711,"comment":null},{"amount":46.69,"local_amount":83256,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":84500.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320274,"comment":null},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":84851,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86119.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803404,"comment":null},{"amount":48.49,"local_amount":86478,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87771.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614483,"comment":null},{"amount":49.42,"local_amount":88135,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":89452.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568449,"comment":null},{"amount":50.37,"local_amount":89824,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91167.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779790,"comment":null},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":91546,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":92914.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188202,"comment":null},{"amount":52.31,"local_amount":93301,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":94696.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324427,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-22T17:33:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":298459,"name":"San Geronimo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el grupo San Geronimo esta ubicado en la aldea San Geronimo de la Ciudad de Choluteca y esta integrado por tres personas, las cuales se conocen desde hace mucho tiempo y son vecinos de dicha aldea.

She lives with her 46-year old husband Alcides and their six children, who they want to provide with a good education. Aquilina is well-known in her neighborhood. At an early hour she prepares her work tools and walks quickly to her green fields where she grows cocoa, coffee, and fruits like pineapples and plantains. With a lot of hard work she has made these plants productive. Now her crops are grown with technical expertise thanks to the support and training she receives from agronomists. Her difficulty is in combatting moniliasis and the bit, which are plagues that attack cocoa and coffee. This is why she is requesting a loan from MFP.

un hombre muy responsable de 42 a\u00f1os que ha sostenido su hogar  trabajando independientemente, en un negocio que inici\u00f3   hace seis a\u00f1os impulsado por un amigo, propietario de un expendio y fue de aqu\u00ed donde se deriv\u00f3 su emprendimiento; Luis Enrique comenz\u00f3 vendiendo carnero semanalmente al detal a los vecinos del barrio y a los copropietarios de un edificio, donde prest\u00f3 el servicio de celadur\u00eda  y consigui\u00f3 muchos clientes a quienes hoy les vende de contado y a cr\u00e9dito a cortos plazos.\nSu meta a nivel familiar es  que alg\u00fan d\u00eda sus hijos sean profesionales  y su meta empresarial es aumentar su capacidad de compra pues quiere convertirse en mayorista  de ganado   y quiere cuidar su historia crediticia por eso es cauteloso cuando se trata del  pago de sus obligaciones, y est\u00e1 organiz\u00e1ndose para poco a poco  conseguir este prop\u00f3sito. Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo porque requiere  adecuar la cubierta de su negocio,  para evitar que la temporada de invierno que ya se avecina,  pueda afectarle su actividad y con este cr\u00e9dito tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1  carne de cerdo, ganado vacuno y  gallina para la venta pues su mercado ha crecido y diariamente solicita que tengan diversos productos en su oferta, para atraer  a un mayor n\u00famero de clientes y que estos tengan de donde escoger de acuerdo a sus gustos y cultura alimentaria. \nCuando inici\u00f3 su negocio lo hizo mediante conexiones con propietarios de fincas y  vendiendo cerdo y gallipava alrededor de su vivienda, con el tiempo se dio a conocer en el sector y ahora no solo vende en el centro de Malambo, sino que en todo el municipio entre restaurantes  y otros clientes que compran al por mayor y con sus ingresos  poco a poco ha organizado su expendio, adicionando un congelador para la conservaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos,  con un pr\u00e9stamo que obtuvo con el que logr\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n enchapar las paredes. \u00c9l viaja los fines de semana para hacer las compras  a Cascajal, Ponedera,  Sabanagrande Puerto Giraldo y justamente en estos sitios ha conocido muchos propietarios de fincad, los cuales lo est\u00e1n motivando para comercializar su ganado y a Luis le parece una buena idea aunque planea hacerlo con calma.  Como muestra del alcance de Luis,  su organizaci\u00f3n y la proyecci\u00f3n que tiene,  hace dos a\u00f1os formaliz\u00f3 su microempresa y obtuvo el registro mercantil ante la C\u00e1mara de Comercio, para continuar ganando credibilidad en el mercado y oportunidades comerciales superiores a las actuales.  \n","en":"Luis Enrique lives in the community of Centro in the municipality of Malambo. He lives with his wife and their two children, aged 8 and 12. He is a very responsible, 42-year old man who has supported his household by working independently on a business he started six years ago. He was encouraged by a friend, the owner of an outlet, and that is from where he derived his own business. Luis Enrique started out sell ram's meat weekly to his neighbors in the community and to the co-owners of a building where he worked as a security guard. There he earned many clients and he completes his sales in cash and on short-term credit.\r\n\r\nHis goal for his family is to one day see his children have careers. His goal for his business is to increase his purchase capacity, wanting to convert into a cattle wholesaler. He wants to protect his credit history so he is cautious with his loan payment obligations and his is gradually organizing himself to meet his goal. This Kiva loan is the first loan he has accessed through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and he requires it to recondition the roofing on his business, to be ready for the approaching winter season which could affect his business. He will also purchase pork, beef, and chicken meats to resell. His market has grown in the number of clients. He wants to offer them a selection according to their likes and to their gastronomical culture.\r\n\r\nHe started out his business through connections with owners of farms and by selling pork and turkey meat in his neighborhood. With time he got to know the business and today he not only sells in downtown Malambo, but also at the restaurants and other clients who buy in wholesale in the entire municipality. His profits he has been gradually organizing his store, adding a freezer to conserve his foods. He was also able to refinish the walls with a loan he acquired. He travels on the weekends to make his purchases in Cascajal, Ponedera, Sabanagrande and Puerto Giraldo and it is at these locations that he has gotten to know many farmers. They have been encouraging him to sell their cattle and he thinks it's a good idea, although he plans on taking his time. Given that Luis's goals are within his reach, his organization, and his projection for the future he formalized his business by registering it with Chamber of Commerce. He will continue to earn credibility in the market and to secure better commercial activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":769513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to install a roof on his building.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-18T11:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109489},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114463},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116656},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118892},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121171},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":123494},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125860},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":128273},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130731},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133237},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135791},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141943}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.04,"local_amount":109489,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":112299.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509494,"comment":null},{"amount":64.87,"local_amount":114463,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":117400.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673715,"comment":null},{"amount":66.1,"local_amount":116656,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":119650.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320278,"comment":null},{"amount":67.37,"local_amount":118892,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":121943.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803408,"comment":null},{"amount":589.62,"local_amount":1040500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1067206.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T00:51:30Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":298503,"name":"Bonanza (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Bonanza esta formado por 7 mujeres quienes son amigas y vecinas, mujeres alegres y carism\u00e1ticas que se dedican a diferentes actividades para mejorar  econ\u00f3micamente y as\u00ed salir adelante con  sus familias.

Kisumu is the region in Kenya that harbors Lake Victoria and is commonly referred to as the lake basin.\r\n\r\nCliffton runs a carpentry shop in which he makes beds, cupboards, couches and other things for the local people. He has been operating this business for nine years now and has managed to provide employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well.\r\n\r\nCliffton is using this loan of 80,000 KES to increase his inventory of timber and cloth for making couches and other items as per his customers' demands. He hopes to grow his business and open a show room for leather couches and, in future, become the leading seller of standard furniture in Kisumu.
