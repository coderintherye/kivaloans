She is a courageous woman who lives alongside her two children in a house that she takes care of for some relatives. Since her childhood, she has been very much tied to agricultural activities, and for a number of years she suffered the injustice of low prices, because of which she was not able to recoup her investment in the products that she harvested. Furthermore, she was not compensated for her physical effort. Often the climate changes were very drastic, completely damaging her entire production. In the face of this situation that she was going through, she chose to look for alternative crops that would improve her production and her finances. It was thus that she began to plant grains such as wheat, corn, barley, and quinoa, among others, which after harvest are processed before they are sold. This gives an added value to her products, which she bags in sacks and sells wholesale and retail in the public market in the city closest to her community. In parallel with this activity, she raises and sells sheep. She thus feels very happy with this good decision, and now she hopes to acquire more land to plant these grains in larger quantities. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and during this time she has shown that she is punctual and responsible in her work, so she is well recommended in her communal bank, where she has had pleasant experiences of solidarity and good fellowship, and for that reason she continues to be an active member of her communal bank. She will use the loan she is applying for to buy sacks of fertilizer so that she can continue planting, at this time, quinoa and corn.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":731980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835277,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T08:28:08Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282118,"name":"Amparo De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Algunos problemas de salud hicieron que Amparo de Jes\u00fas Loaiza T. se viera obligada a dejar su trabajo en una fabrica de arepas, situaci\u00f3n que la impuls\u00f3 a crear su propio negocio ya que es madre cabeza de familia y ella junto con su hijo son quienes cubren los gastos del hogar. \n\nDesde entonces y con la pujanza caracter\u00edstica de una mujer emprendedora, Amparo empez\u00f3 con una miscelanea en la que vende productos diversos, pues es \u00e9sta la oportunidad no s\u00f3lo para vender sino para realizar diferentes manualidades para aprovechar sus habilidades y as\u00ed ofrecer otros productos. \n\nActualmente, Amparo necesita de un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar alguna mercanc\u00eda y as\u00ed tratar de recuperarse, puesto que su cartera ha aumentado y ello le ha generado descapitalizaci\u00f3n. \n\nEn el futuro Amparo sue\u00f1a con tener un negocio amplio y con gran variedad de surtido y as\u00ed generar empleo para otras mujeres que lo necesiten.  \n\n\n","en":"Due to various health problems, Amparo de Jes\u00fas Loaiza T. needed to leave her job in an \"arepas\" factory.

She is married and has 2 children. She works as both a merchant and a farmer. She has worked in business for 2 years. She is also studying to be a school teacher. She began when she was 34 with her own capital. Before she worked giving preschool classes to children who live around her community. She did this for 21 years. \r\n\r\nThen in 2009 she started selling clothing and cosmetics to the people who live in her neighborhood. Later she sold juice, sodas, and food, including rosquillas (a ring-shaped pastry similar to a doughnut) which she made with a group of women that she directed. Her husband works in the fields. Additionally, she grows beans on her father-in-law's lands, the income from which is helpful when sales from her other products are down. She would like for her products to become known at the local markets and the central market, and she would like to have a place to sell on the main street in Estel\u00ed.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to prepare kiosks where she can sell food, and to purchase the necessary kitchen utensils. With this investment she hopes to increase her clientele and her sales, and to improve the economic standard of living for her family. Her plans for the future include having three more kiosks where she can sell food, but for now she will begin with just one. She also hopes to offer jobs to the women in her community, to have a vehicle for work so she can transport and sell her products. Her next goals are to pay for the university studies of her children, finish her own studies to become a certified teacher, and build a kitchen garden with the other women where they can grow their own vegetables so they don't have to buy them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":731832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to prepare kiosks where she can sell food, and to purchase the necessary kitchen utensils ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-03-16T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betha De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":362.14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206193440,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211267162,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":40.23,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216547106,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221715846,"comment":null},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":40.23,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":41.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227086319,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232848111,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238663240,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244769938,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":40.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T02:49:56Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282121,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Francisco vive por la zona del plan 3000 desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y sus tres hijos.

She is 30 years old, a single mother, and has three children.  Her business is selling tortillas.  Owing to the fact that her family didn't have enough money for her to study, she only managed to finish sixth grade in elementary school.\r\n\r\nAda started making tortillas with her mom at the age of 15.  Although she is originally from Yali, she has been living in Estel\u00ed for more than 20 years.  When she was 23 years old, she started working independently from her mom.  She started out in her own business selling tortillas after having received support from her aunt who lives in the United States.  Ada used to sell 'nactamales' (Nicaraguan tamales) but now she solely makes and sells tortillas which she distributes in her neighborhood.  Ada would like her products to become known in the central markets and supermarkets of Estel\u00ed.\r\n\r\nAda is requesting this loan so that she can build a room.  She will buy bricks, cement and sand.  This will help her a lot because she will be able to improve the infrastructure of her home.  This is important as she sells her tortillas from her home.

Jaime is a bus [or, possibly, cab] driver.  The family lives in a busy neighborhood in the north of Lima.  Judith has operated a store in her house, selling everyday merchandise, for two years.  She says that the business is stable and profitable and she needn't leave her own house to manage it.  When she does have to go out, her children help her by manning the shop while she's away.  She adds that she has gradually improved the business.  She started with a few food products but now she sells a wider variety of products to her customers.  Judith's store is the only one in the neighborhood and most of her customers live nearby.  Her favorite thing about the business is meeting and chatting with her customers.  Judith is an enterprising women and she's been planning, for some time, to stock the business with even more merchandise.  She also wants to improve the shop's fittings so her customers can shop more comfortably.  This is Judith's third MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on time.  She doesn't want anyone who has made this source of funding possible to give up on her.  She knows that the loans have allowed her to improve her business and get ahead.

She doesn't only make meals but also delicious sausages which are very popular with her customers since, as she says, nobody makes them better than she does.\r\n\r\nEstrella will use this loan to buy rice, meat, fish and other ingredients for making her meals.  She has been a member of her community bank since its second loan cycle and she likes being a member because it has always managed to get her out of tight spots.  Her dream is to buy a car which her husband can use to sell his products since right now he uses a three-wheeled vehicle."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":732068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, meat, fish and other ingredients for making her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estrella Del Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201284194,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:09Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206152103,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224937,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503728,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221667675,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036491,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-19T15:50:25Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":282154,"name":"Dilberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dilberto es un padre de familia de 38 a\u00f1os de edad que reside junto a su esposa y a sus dos hijas en el sector Villa del Mar del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz.

is a 40-year-old married woman who supports her family by selling fish in the market. She lives in Toledo, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard selling fish, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Josephine is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase stocks of fish to sell in the market.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 22,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Josephine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.

A. is from the village of Namnama, Cabatuan, Isabela. She is 56 years old. Luzviminda is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling second-hand clothing to the local community. Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional clothes to sell. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional clothes to sell. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Remelinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Remelinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional bananas & coconuts to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Remelinda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Consejo has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Consejo joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Consejo is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Consejo from PMPC.

O. is from the village of Palomoc, Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Juanita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Juanita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

I. is 57 years old. He lives in the village of Tsereteli, Marneuli District with his family \u2013 wife and son. Datuni works in local poultry factory. Datuni\u2019s wife works as a cook and his 22-year-old son is a wrestler. Besides their main jobs, all family members are involved in family agricultural activities: They have two milch cows and dairy products are sold to local retailers. Also the family owns a plot of land where Lucerne (alfalfa) is grown, which is used for feeding their own cows. Total average monthly income of the family is up to GEL 850. \r\n\r\nWith the requested amount Datuni plans to renovate\/launch a traditional Georgian bread bakery, which is located in the building of his house.

Eso le permitir\u00e1 al cliente trabajar tranquilo sin tener que recurrir a prestamistas informales que le cobran tasas alt\u00edsimas, lo cual perjudica su liquidez diaria y retrasa su crecimiento tanto comercial como familiar. Julio es un cliente recurrente para Edpyme Alternativa y tiene buenas referencias personales y laborales. Les agradece mucho a los prestamistas de Kiva por su apoyo en el crecimiento de su negocio y la mejora de su condici\u00f3n familiar.\n\n","en":"Julio is 36 years old, married, and has three children in school.  He and his family live in their own home in Monsef\u00fa, an area known for its tourist and religious festivals.  This district is located twenty minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  Julio\u2019s community receives basic services such as electricity, water, and sewage drainage.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past three years, Julio and his wife have managed a small store in their home.  There they offer their neighbors and customers different everyday consumer products ranging from basic necessities to groceries.  This business has been well-received and has an established customer base since it is one of the few stores in the area.  Julio also provides masonry and plumbing services to earn additional income for his family.\r\n<p>\r\nHe wants to invest this loan in the purchase of more merchandise, such as school supplies, to sell in his store.  In addition, he plans to use part of the loan to pay for the school expenses of his young children.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN.  Edpyme is offering this loan at a very low interest rate.  This will allow Julio to work effortlessly without having to resort to informal lenders that charge high interest rates, which would impact his daily liquidity and slow the growth of his family business.  Julio is a repeat client of Edpyme Alternativa and has good personal and work-related references.  He is extremely grateful for the Kiva loans that have helped support the growth of his business and improve the condition of his family.
