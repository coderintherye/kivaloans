This is why, in order to provide for her children, Larisa decided to start her own business and work with sweat on her face to have a consistent income.  She started selling various types of merchandise fifteen years ago.  Today, Larisa sells plastic covers for tables, napkins, tablecloths, mosquito nets, etc. in the \"Maydan\" store.  Today, Larisa's merchandise is valued at 15,000 hryvnia.  Larisa plans to use the loan of 12,000 hryvnia to add to the assortment of plastic table covers, tablecloths, napkins and nets for sale in her store.

is 28 years of age and married with one child. At her young age, she is able to manage her variety store. She has been operating it for three years, and she is able to earn about P3,500 a month. She would like to improve her store by completing the set of groceries she sells. With the income generated from her business, Neriza couldn't buy a complete set of basic needs due to the high cost of basic commodities.

Moses is the facilitator of the Wakape Njete group. Several members of this group are entering their third season with One Acre Fund!\r\n\r\nMoses takes care of six children at home with his wife.

In the recent 2011 season, Moses had an excellent maize yield harvesting eight bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Ace Fund, Moses was only able to harvest four bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Moses and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Moses will continue to invest in his farm and pay for household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wakape Njete group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph, Moses is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":887058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-23T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":66150,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-24T13:17:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":347776,"name":"Leonor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonor is an honest and hardworking person.

is Romeo, 49, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. He is married to Emma, a housewife and mother to their six children. Together they manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRomeo operates a tricycle transportation business. He owns a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached into it) that carries up to four to five passengers to their destination within the community. He earns through the boundary (daily quota) that their driver remits each day. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 300 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be using the loan for additional spare parts and the maintenance of his tricycle. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nRomeo hopes to be able to expand soon and to sustain their daily needs.

She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMiriam hopes her business will be stable and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 32,000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.

 Since 1992 Asylbek's family has been successfully growing livestock and reselling agricultural produce.  He pays special attention to cultivating and growing a specific type of potato, that has had an increase in demand from the local population.  Stubborn and hard work on his business allows Asylbek to pay for his family's expenses and to support his elderly parents and their household.  \r\n\r\nIn order to continue to increase his livestock headcount Asylbek turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) in order to purchase additional livestock for fattening.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for his family.

Before joining One Ace Fund, Joan was only able to harvest 3 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\n\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Wilberforce and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February, 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. In 2012, the members of Weyeta SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\n\nWith income from maize sales, Joan will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.

","en":"Sonunbubu is 51 years old, a widow and has four children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Sonunbubu started her own animal husbandry business in 1989.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Sonunbubu was able to develop her business to contain two cows, ten sheep, ten goats and two horses today and yielding about 5,000 som per month.  Sonunbubu invested the profit into the higher education for her children, enabling her daughters to become and English language teacher and a lawyer and her son to become a military officer.  Her youngest son, Ulanbek, decided to stay with his mother and help her with the business because Sonunbubu's elderly mother-in-law decided to continue living with her family after Sonunbubu's husband's death.  In order to further expand her business, Sonunbubu requested a loan in the sum of 133,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to use the profit from this loan to increase livestock quantity in the

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family in every way possible, since she is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask Juana what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes to share the health and credit training with the group.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2193.75,"image":{"id":897175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy socks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-10-18T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Pamela\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola Maritza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Germana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20191.83,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":3365.3,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3392.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650367,"comment":null},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":3365.3,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867363,"comment":null},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":5047.95,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5089.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277107,"comment":null},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":3365.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T14:28:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":348102,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Edwin es productor lechero  tambi\u00e9n vende afrecho.
