One has to have patience. We arrived in Katwe, a slum area on the outskirts of Kampala around 3:00PM. Most disbursements occur in the afternoon because the chairperson and treasury have to go to the bank, collect the money, and return to their village. Sometimes even lines at banks can be a couple of hours. Once they have returned to the village, someone is sent out to tell all the members that it is time to meet. \r\n<p>\r\nWe arrived at the meeting place, a simple concrete home in Katwe. Most homes are adobe. Removing our shoes, we entered through the draped doorway. We took our seat on a comfortable but worn sofa and waited. Over the next two hours, people arrived and took a place on the floor. We waited for all to arrive. As people came through the draped doorway into the darkened room, they would greet us with \u201cYou are most welcome\u201d and then take their place in the room. By the time all had arrived, there were 28 persons in a 12ft. by 12ft. room lit only by the light of the doorway. There is a peaceful calm in groups. Ugandans rarely raise their voices.

He is a distributor of sodas and beer which he sells in cases to retailers. Most villages have one distributor. He will purchase quantities of 200 cases at a time with 24 bottles to a case. A case of soda will cost him 9700 shillings, or about 400 shillings per bottle. He will then sell it to the retailer who will sell it to the customer for 500 shillings. So, the gross profit earned between both the wholesaler and the retailer is about 100 shillings per bottle. 100 shillings is about five cents. \r\n<p>\r\nVincent has been a distributor since 1993. This is an excellent business, because you have a contract with the bottler and you have little competition.

In addition to supporting his family, during the fishing season he employs as many as ten men paying each between $2.50 and $3.75 per day.  Heat expressed concern that the future of fishing in this area does not look so positive.

Like many men in this area, the husbands have all been fishing since they were boys.  Two of them, Mr. S. Math and Mr. S. Ousman, were fishing at the time of the loan interview.  They do not appear in this photograph.  They are requesting this, their first group loan from Maxima, to buy fishing nets, a second-hand motor for one boat and for general boat repair costs.\r\n<p>\r\n1- Mr. S. Tol (aged 45) and his wife (center couple in image) married in 1989.  They have six children, three of whom study in the village school.  One son fishes with his father.  His wife takes care of the children and household as well as sells the fish her husband catches.  They are saving to buy a car that they will then use as a taxi. They are requesting a loan from MAXIMA for US$300 and will use this money to buy fishing nets and a second-hand motor for his fishing boat.\r\n<p>\r\n2- Mr. S. Math (aged 39) and his wife (far right of image) married in 1990.  They have four children, two of whom study in the village school.  His wife sells green papaya salad at the afternoon market along the lane that runs through their village.  They are requesting a loan from MAXIMA for the first time for $US100 and will use this money to buy fishing nets.\r\n<p>\r\n3- Mr. S. Ousman (aged 44) and his wife (far left of image) married in 1986.  They have six children, two of whom study in school, two of whom have stopped studying and two of whom are physically disabled.  His wife describes the disability as \u201ctheir arms and legs don\u2019t work\u201d.

Every single morning, she takes a wide variety of products from the city to the rural countryside of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa to sell. Because there are no stores outside the city limits of Ayacucho, the people living there rely on weekly markets for all the food items and other goods they cannot produce themselves. Bernardina has capitalized on this market and everyday she travels to a different location to set up her stand and sell to the communities. She loads her giant wicker basket with fresh fruits and vegetables. She and her husband even bake bread in a rented oven near their home, which she also loads up to sell in the country. \r\n\r\nThis type of job is extremely strenuous and tiring. Bernardina wakes up every morning at 4 a.m. and sometimes doesn\u2019t return home until after 8 p.m. However strenuous her vocation, it is necessary, as she is supporting her entire family of 5 children and her husband with her meager income. Years before, Bernardina\u2019s husband also had a job and worked very hard. However, he fell gravely ill and is now unable to perform manual labor. Thus, Bernardina bears the family\u2019s economic burden on her own. She is highly motivated though. She has been saving diligently in order to reach the goal of educating all five of her children in obtaining a university degree. Without the economic help Bernardina has received through her village bank and the support of her family, realization of her dreams would be nearly impossible. Bernardina is requesting a loan of $350.

Today she owns and runs two stores specializing in beverages, but it took an impressive amount of dedication and initiative to accomplish what she has. Four years ago, Flor Mar\u00eda had a small stand selling prepared meals in one of the local markets in Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. It was a difficult way to make a living, as the flow of customers was often unreliable due to extremely high rates of competition. In order to improve her economic situation she decided to make a change and open a store specializing in beverages. She supplies all types of sodas and juices, but her big seller is the \u201ccerveza.\u201d Little by little, Flor Mar\u00eda store grew and attracted more customers and she was eventually able to open a second store. \r\n\r\nToday, Flor Mar\u00eda has hired two \u201cse\u00f1oritas\u201d who take care of all the sales and customer service, while Flor Mar\u00eda handles all the administrative duties for the two stores. She builds relationships with her suppliers, watches her product flow carefully to decide what should be stocked, and everything else that goes along with running a small business. It\u2019s hard work and she always seems to have a million things on her to-do list, but she loves her job.\r\n\r\nFlor Mar\u00eda\u2019s next goal is to open a third store in Ayacucho. She is an obviously ambitious woman who is constantly looking for ways to bring her business to the next level. This is why she loves her village bank. It has taught her responsibility, punctuality, and how to save money in the bank where it accumulates interest. Moreover, Flor Mar\u00eda loves her bank because through it she has made valuable lifelong friendships that serve as a distraction from the difficulties of everyday life. Flor Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan of $350. All of this money will be reinvested into her beverage business, with the majority going towards the purchase of spirits, as they are the most popular and the most expensive product she supplies."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":94246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase spirits, which are both popular and expensive","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-12-07T23:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T08:57:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120120,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140283,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163852,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":256.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188841,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T08:57:16Z","paid_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":26705,"name":"Basti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basti (her husband is pictured) is a mother of six children.

the middle of the \u201cJesus de Nazarenas\u201d Market in Ayacucho, Peru, one can find Gladys behind her large condiments stand, surrounded by colorful sauces and spices. Located directly in front of the butcher section, she is in the perfect place to sell her products. Gladys prepares the condiments daily in her home very early in the morning. She packs these up in tupperware containers and brings it to her stand. She makes ground garlic, red, yellow, and green chili sauces, boiled potatoes, and several additional types of condiments used daily in almost every Ayacuchan household. She also sells other types of ingredients such as milk, butter, cheese, crackers, soy sauce, etc. This is a very common and very convenient type of stand found in a number of the large farmers markets within Peru. <p>\r\n<p>For example, a mother shopping in preparation for the large daily meal at noon can stop by the butcher\u2019s section and order a supply of fresh meat. From there, she can turn around to Gladys, tell her that she will be preparing a beef dish. With this information, Gladys takes a small plastic bag and fills it with a complex mixture of the different types of her condiments to customize the perfect beef seasoning.<p> \r\n<p>Gladys knows exactly how helpful her stand is for her busy customers who are taking care of their children and their homes and also need to prepare a large meal for several hungry mouths. Seven years ago, just before she decided to open up a stand in the market, Gladys was a housewife raising 3 children while her husband worked. When her children grew older, she found she had free time and decided to supplement her husband\u2019s modest income.<p> \r\n<p>One day, Gladys would love to open a grocery store from her home. She is also financing the education of all three of her children. One daughter is studying obstetrics, one is just about to enter the university, and the last is still in middle school. \r\nThere are many reasons Gladys is motivated to expand her business and save money. This is why she is so glad to have been a part of her village bank for the past 7 years. It was through the bank that she has learned about punctuality and responsibility, two values essential to running a successful business. She is currently requesting a loan of $350. With this money she will stock up on all of her most popular products and the ingredients that go into her freshly prepared

Because her home city of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa is located rather remotely in the Andes Mountains, it is difficult to find a variety of clothing and jewelry. For this reason, Iris makes the monthly ten hour bus trip to the capital city of Lima to buy beautiful clothing and jewelry which she carries home to Ayacucho and sells to friends, family, and customers. Much of the time she receives orders, for example for a summer sundress, and with this direction she uses her good taste to pick out a nice outfit. \r\n\r\nIris has been involved in this business for the past 10 years, and is very content. The way she currently does business allows her much freedom and the ability her to travel, an aspect she loves. She is currently entering the busiest time of year. In Ayacucho, at the end of the school year (which is in January), there are many graduation parties. From those completing primary school to high school graduations, families celebrate this happy occasion. A staple of these parties is the perfect graduation dress. Beginning in December, orders begin pouring to Iris from mothers wanting the perfect graduation dress for their daughters. Thus, Iris is planning a special weeklong trip to Lima in December, when she will buy many dresses to bring back to Ayacucho. An economic boost in the form of a small loan is what makes projects such as this possible for Iris. It is also what has made the support of her family of four daughters possible.

Rosa\u2019s older sister is a talented weaver, and when Rosa was a young girl, she would take her sister\u2019s tapestries into the city center to sell. Over the years, Rosa used her knowledge of tapestry sales to create a thriving business. Today, she has her own stand in the biggest market in Ayacuho, Peru, where she sells all types of hand woven pieces shipped from all over the country. The majority of artesan\u00edas come from Cusco, but she also sells goods that come from Bolivia. She also sells goods that are made right in her home town of Ayacucho, which she contracts by traveling from weaver to weaver, soliciting partnerships. \r\n\r\nRosa has been selling from her stand in the local market for the past 15 years. Her goal is to look for ways to move forward and progress, growing her business to its full potential. She has been earning profits and saving her money diligently. Currently, she is saving her money to buy a computer for the oldest of her four children. He is 22 years old and studying at the local university. Education is very important to Rosa and she is very happy to be able to provide such opportunities for her children. \r\n\r\nRosa says she is extremely happy with her local bank.

However, it didn\u2019t take long before she made lifelong friendships and she now feels as though she has a second family. The bank has also provided her with immense economic assistance.

There are no stores of any kind in the country, leaving the rural populations to depend on feriantes like Sady for all their purchases. This is why, every single day, Sady makes the 2 hour trip to the country with a large load of clothing.

Sady passionately explains that the motivation to continue working so hard everyday in such an incredibly tiring profession comes from her two children. She diligently saves her money in the bank in anticipation of funding the education of her 1 and 4 year old all the way through university. Education is the most important gift Sady could possibly give to her sons, she explains, and the only way to surpass poverty in the long run. Professionally, Sady is working towards opening a clothing store in the city of Ayacucho.

She counts on a large number of customers that know her good taste in clothing and eagerly await the novelties that she can offer them. <p>\r\nWith this loan from Manuela Ramos, which she will repay in four months, she will purchase 3 kilos of rice, 1 kilo of sugar, 3 packets of salt, beef, and five chickens. Additionally, she will expand her current location. <p>\r\nBlanca is very pleased to belong to Manuela Ramos; she has told us that it changed her life, and she is happy because she sees the results of her investment.

She will buy 2 cylinders of fuel to transport her timber.  One-third of the loan (S\/. 600) will be used for transport costs.

She wakes up very early to complete her household duties and then goes out to purchase the merchandise she will later sell.  She visits the area surrounding the Ucayali River weekly to sell her merchandise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sonia has recently requested a loan from Manuela Ramos in the amount of 2,000 \u2018soles\u2019 (approx. $669), which will be repaid within 6 months, she plans to purchase 2 bales of clothes, 30 pairs of shoes and 10 pairs of slippers, along with other articles of clothing per personal use.\r\n\r\nSonia is very happy to have her children healthy and professionals.  They are her pride and joy.  Thanks her efforts and dedication, she is achieving all her desires.\r\n   \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Christian Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Sonia pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Fresitas\u201d,  vive en el Jr. Iparia Mz. 35 Lt. 8, distrito de Yarina Cocha D. departamento de Ucayali.

is 44 years old and a mother of four.  She used to work hard to sell groceries, which also generated no income because there was no big supply and demand for these products in her city.  Three years ago, she gave up selling  groceries.  Now, she sells clothing to various houses: she sells clothing seasonally, leaving her customers the products and getting paid at her next return visit.  She works in the same company her husband Juan Manuel works.  He is also responsible for the administration of bill collection from his customers every 30 days.   Teresa, like all mothers, wishes that her children become professionally successful.  That is why she works very hard with dedication to this job.  Currently, she has her own store which is not used because there are many repairs that need to be done to display her clothing.  With this goal to refurbish this place, establish her business, and sell her products, she seeks a loan to develop and utilize the space that she has.

Gonzales mentioned that her son is sick and she\u2019ll have to make a great effort and invest half of the loan in her business and use the other half to buy medicines for her son.  \r\n<p>Members of Azucena have several dreams. Maril\u00fa Jacinta C. pointed out that she wants to send her son, recently graduated from high-school, to college. For that she needs her business to keep prospering as it has been recently. Concepci\u00f3n M. wants another loan because she would like her business to consolidate to the point where she\u2019s able to buy a small lot of land for her son. \r\n<p>These women constitute an example for all the indigenous women in the region.  Many years ago, they decided to become financially independent and support their respective husbands with extra money to cover household expenses.\r\n<p> Thanks to their effort they are reaching their goals, sending their children to school and providing them with a permanent roof and sufficient food, in order for them to advance. The Azucenas are a typical example of Guatemalan indigenous women, who set the well-being of their families above their own. Nonetheless, if their businesses grow and prosper in the way they have projected, that situation doesn\u2019t have to continue, and all will be able to enjoy a good life. Help them!  \r\n<P>One of the women was not able to be in the picture, due to health issues. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa ComUnidad Azucenas (ComUnidad es un t\u00e9rmino que utiliza Friendship Bridge para llamar a los Bancos comunales) est\u00e1 conformado por un grupo de se\u00f1oras que sorprenden a los veedores por su organizaci\u00f3n y puntualidad. Las Azucenas siempre llegan a las reuniones de repago y desembolso a la hora exacta, luego prosiguen a sentarse en orden y esperan a que la agente de cr\u00e9dito les de la palabra inicial una vez que todo est\u00e1 en orden. Esta organizaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n se ve en el aspecto financiero. Estas se\u00f1oras han venido trabajando, colaborando y compartiendo juntas desde hace aproximadamente 7 a\u00f1os. La receta para que esta ComUnidad haya permanecido junta por tanto tiempo es que esta se\u00f1oras han combinado distintos ingredientes como: la puntualidad del repago, la honestidad, la solidaridad y la confianza. \r\n<P>Casi todas de las integrantes de esta ComUnidad han sido y son tejedoras. Desde peque\u00f1as ellas aprendieron a tejer con la t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura, telas te\u00f1idas con tintes naturales. Adem\u00e1s, ellas aprendieron a te\u00f1ir los hilos con tintes naturales. Estos tintes naturales las se\u00f1oras los traen de las monta\u00f1as. Ellas utilizan el tronco del banano como fijador de colores, el tronco del aguacate, hojas de arbustos, plantas medicinales e ingredientes de comida para sacar los tintes. Las t\u00e9cnicas que ellas utilizan las aprendieron de sus madres y abuelas. Son tradiciones que han sido aprendidas por generaciones en San Juan la Laguna. \r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en comprar hilo al por mayor para reducir sus costos de producci\u00f3n. Una de las se\u00f1oras es pintora. Ella va a utilizar el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar pintura \u00f3leo. Mar\u00eda C. Gonzales coment\u00f3 que su hijo estaba enfermo. Ella va a hacer malabares para invertir la mitad de su cr\u00e9dito en su negocio y la otra mitad en comprar medicinas para su hijo. \r\n<P>Las integrantes de las Azucenas tienen varios sue\u00f1os. Maril\u00fa Jacinta C. coment\u00f3 que ella quiere mandar a su hijo reci\u00e9n graduado del colegio a la universidad. Lo \u00fanico que necesita es que su negocio siga prosperando de la misma manera como ha venido sucediendo. Concepci\u00f3n M. quiere otro pr\u00e9stamo porque quiere que su negocio se consolide al punto donde ella pueda ganar lo suficiente para poder comprar un terrenito para su hijo. \r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras son un ejemplo para todas las mujeres ind\u00edgenas de la regi\u00f3n. Muchos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s ellas decidieron independizarse econ\u00f3micamente y apoyar a sus respectivos maridos con dinero extra para cubrir los gastos de la casa.\r\n<P>Gracias a su esfuerzo ellas est\u00e1n cumpliendo sus objetivos, mandar a sus hijos a la escuela y proveerles un techo permanente y suficiente comida para que puedan salir adelante. Las Azucenas son un t\u00edpico ejemplo de la mujer ind\u00edgena Guatemalteca, ellas ponen el bienestar de su familia por encima del de ellas. Sin embargo, si sus negocio crecen y prosperan de la manera como ellas han proyectado, esa situaci\u00f3n no va a tener que suceder, ya que todos van a poder disfrutar de una buena vida. Ay\u00fadenlas a salir adelante!\r\n<P>Una de las se\u00f1oras no pudo estar presente en la fotograf\u00eda por razones de

This ComUnidad is one of the oldest in Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\n<P>This group of women are requesting their 16th loan with the institution, despite the adversities that are presented to indigenous women in the rural areas of Guatemala. They have maintained themselves united for approximately 7 years, consolidating an unequaled friendship based on honesty and work ethic. The women of Xocomil are an example to Guatemalan society because they were one of the pioneers when they first applied for a loan almost a decade ago \u2013 a situation that had never occurred before.\r\n\r\n<P>Many of these women worked as housekeepers in wealthy homes in the capital city or in the homes of their relatives. Others grew up as weavers, lending their services to more developed businesses as cheap labor. These artisans also worked weaving their own products per individual requests, but in a very small scale. They earned enough to cover their living expenses, however, since they united with Friendship Bridge, their businesses have prospered and they have turned into successful businesswomen.\r\n\r\n<P>In ComUnidad Xocomil, one can find women that work in different economic sectors. For example, six of them weave beautiful huipiles (traditional indigenous Guatemalan dress); three of them work buying and selling traditional clothes such as skirts, aprons, sashes and blouses; three others sell breakfasts, lunches and dinners in the market and for house delivery; while another three cut up chickens and pigs and sell them in the market. One of them makes and sells tortillas in her own locale, while two others have a bakery.\r\n\r\n<P>The women will invest the loan in the purchase of thread for the production of huipiles and the purchase of chickens to quarter and sell in the market, while other women will buy blouses and aprons for their respective trade. The women that have a bakery will buy flour and utensils for the production of bread.\r\n\r\n<P>These women have been examples of the positive impact that microfinancing institutions have on the lives of women. Thanks to Friendship Bridge, they are full of hopes and dreams. Many of them aspire to purchase a plot of land to construct a house for their children or expand their small homes. They also hope that their children graduate from high school so that they do not have to experience what these women lived, an illiteracy that deprived them of many rights and advantages. The dreams of these women are consolidated with each loan and investment that they bring to their businesses and families.

Ellas se han mantenido unidas por aproximadamente 7 a\u00f1os consolidando una amistad inigualable que est\u00e1 basada en honestidad y trabajo. Las mujeres del Xocomil son un ejemplo a la sociedad Guatemalteca porque ellas fueron una de las pioneras al solicitar su cr\u00e9dito hace casi una d\u00e9cada.

Otras crecieron como tejedoras prestando sus servicios a empresarios m\u00e1s desarrollados como mano de obra barata. Tambi\u00e9n, las estas artesanas trabajaban tejiendo sus propios tejidos a pedidos individuales, pero en muy peque\u00f1a escala. Ellas ganaban lo suficiente para cubrir sus gastos de vida. Sin embargo, desde que se unieron a Friendship Bridge sus negocios han prosperado y se han vuelto en empresarias exitosas. \r\n\r\n<P>En la Comunidad Xocomil se puede encontrar a se\u00f1oras que trabajan en distintas \u00e1reas econ\u00f3micas. Por ejemplo, seis de ellas son tejedoras de hermosos huipiles (trajes tradicionales ind\u00edgenas Guatemaltecos); tres trabajan en la compra y venta de ropa tradicional como faldas, delantales, fajas y blusas; tres se\u00f1oras venden desayunos, almuerzos y cenas en el mercado y a domicilio; mientras que otras tres destazan pollos y cerdos y los venden en el mercado; una de ellas prepara y vende tortillas en su propio local y dos se\u00f1oras tienen una panader\u00eda. \r\n\r\n<P>El cr\u00e9dito va a ser invertido por las se\u00f1oras en la compra de hilo para la producci\u00f3n de huipiles, compra de pollos para destazarlos y venderlos en el mercado, otras se\u00f1oras van a usar el cr\u00e9dito para comprar blusas y delantales para su respectiva venta. Las se\u00f1oras que tienen una panader\u00eda van a comprar harina y utensilios para la producci\u00f3n de pan. \r\n\r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras han sido ejemplos del impacto positivo que tiene las microfinanzas en la vida de las mujeres. Ellas, gracias a Friendhsip Bridge, est\u00e1n llenas de esperanzas y sue\u00f1os. Muchas de ellas aspiran a comprarse un terreno para construir una casa para sus hijos o para ampliar sus peque\u00f1as casas. Tambi\u00e9n aspiran a que sus hijos se grad\u00faen del colegio para que as\u00ed ellos no tengan que pasar por lo que ellas vivieron, un analfabetismo que las priv\u00f3 de muchos derechos y ventajas.

This created so much pressure that sometimes he couldn\u2019t take anything at home for his family after failing to get customers. Therefore, James resorted to joining a motorcycle transport business three years back. Today, he owns an old motorcycle and he can realize some daily income and is assured of employment. He operates at Wandegeya, a suburb of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.  The street is very busy and it\u2019s strategically located near the major university called Makerere, where students are his main customers.\r\n<p>\r\nJames has a family of four children, two boys and two girls, aged between 16 to 3. All the children are at school. He wishes to work hard to ensure that they all go to college.\r\n<p>He wishes to borrow $600, which he is planning to supplement with his own savings to purchase a new motorcycle to cope up with customers' needs. (University students, who are his biggest customers, prefer nice new model motorcycles.) SAO MFI (u)Ltd will top up the loan as requested by the client.

She lives with her children, her husband, her late brother\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, and another 2-year-old orphaned relative. While her husband has a job doing development work for the government, Nuru works from home doing embroidery, knitting, and tie & dye. She makes bed sheets, chair cushions, sweaters, and tie-dyed dresses and sells them door-to-door to schools, offices, and homes.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru started her business over two years ago. Before this business, she fried fish, chapattis, and donuts to sell on the street. Because frying was a hot and tiring job, she finds that her new business suits her much better.\r\n<p>\r\nWith a roll of fabric, costing about $24, Nuru is able to make a profit of about $20. A roll of fabric makes about 10 pieces of clothing, and it takes about a week to go through the roll. It takes her about a day to make a tie-dyed dress, 4 days to knit a baby\u2019s outfit, and a week to embroider a bed sheet. She generally works from 4am to 4pm every day. Her sister assists her when she has free time. In a month, Nuru makes between $130 and $160.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru spends the profits from her business on her children and toward school fees. She also sends money to her mother who is financially dependent on her. She puts what is remaining in savings with the hope of buying land one day.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru is the leader of Subgroup B of Tegemeo (Swahili for \u201cexpectation\u201d).

She has been in this business for a period of one year and she got her initial capital from an informal rotating savings arrangment which her group used to have.

She is 29 years old and married with two children.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHer business location is in a place called Maseno in the Kisumu district.  Her business is near a university (Maseno University) and most of her clients are from the university community.  She hopes to use the loan to increase her business stock so that she can carry more clothes in inventory of several varieties more consistently. This has been necessitated by the growing market due to increased dependence of the increasing student population on nearby clothes. Her clothes are preferred since they are cheaper than new clothes.  She also intends to diversify into selling juice after having established and learned that it is a fast-paying business in the locality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMaureen uses the proceeds from her business to supplement her family's income as her husband's income is small.  Her husband is employed in junior ranks and hence has little money to support the business.  She saves part of the income for her children and ploughs back the rest to the business. This is her first loan both for her and for the group.  She is a sub group leader and has displayed good leadership skills.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThough this is the first time the group is taking a loan, they have displayed a high degree of cohesiveness during group preparation and training.  All members of the group come on time and have shown commitment to follow group policies and procedures.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe location of Maureen's business is very strategic as it is close to the university student community who are most of her customers.  Most students and the community around can't afford to buy new clothes and hence her business has a high chance of growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":96029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase stock of clothing materials.

M. is 43 years old, is married, and has four children. She lives in the Kawangware area in Nairobi. Besides her immediate family, she takes care of her 22-year-old sister-in-law, whose mother died. Because Jacqueline\u2019s husband is the eldest in his family, it is therefore his responsibility to take care of his sister, till she finds a job in order to support herself.\r\n<p>\r\nEver since she can remember, Jacqueline had been interested in becoming a tailor. To accomplish this, she joined a training class at Redeemed Gospel Church at Huruma in Nairobi for classes and practical training, which lasted for two years. After training, she started her business in 1996 with about US $147, which she borrowed from her sister. She has since paid that off. She started by making petticoats, which she sold from house to house for a period of six months. The business picked up very well, and with this income she built a stall of her own in Kayole, where she could carry out her business more effectively. She later expanded her business and started making clothes and curtains. And she started offering training; at the moment she has three trainees. Jacqueline was doing well, but unfortunately, her stall was broken into and two of her sewing machines were stolen. Because of this, she had to rent two machines for four months, at about $7 per machine per month. This eventually became too much of a burden and made her business shrink, and she even lost customers. Later she moved from Kayole to Kawangware, and with the money she got after recovering from her loss, she bought a sewing machine.\r\n<p>\r\nJacqueline is now asking for a loan of US $475 to enable her to buy materials and a sewing machine. She says this will enable her to get more students and will also enable her to get back her customers and be able to finish her orders on time. The repayment period for her loan will be 10

On a sad note, Louise\u2019s brother and his wife passed away last year and left behind three children, whom Louise is now taking care of. The children are aged 15, 12, and 8. Because of this big responsibility, Louise has to work twice as hard so that her dependents have enough for their upkeep. \r\n<p>\r\nLouise opened her shop in 1980 after saving about US $147, and her husband gave her an additional $75 to help her with the initial capital. She has since repaid the loan from her husband. The business has been doing well, but the price of commodities has increased, and Louise would also like to add stock so that she can provide her customers a greater variety of goods. \r\n<p>\r\nLouise is therefore requesting a loan of US $800. With this loan, Louise will be able to purchase flour (maize and wheat), rice, sugar, snacks, sodas, detergents, cooking oil, and more. This will boost her income, since more customers will be flocking to her shop. The repayment period for this loan is 10 months.

is a 24-year-old single man who lives in Mlolongo, a growing town just outside of Nairobi that is situated on the busy Nairobi-Mombasa highway. Besides supporting himself, Timothy also supports his 18-year-old brother.\r\n<p>\r\nTimothy started his timber business in November 2006, after his older brother gave him a small loan to buy timber. Previously, Timothy had been selling roasted maize (a popular snack in Kenya) on the street. He began selling maize directly after finishing secondary school and receiving his diploma. His older brother also helped him get started in this first micro-business.  \r\n<p>\r\nTimothy started his timber business because, while he was selling maize, he noticed that people were bringing timber to Mlolongo from the forests outside Nairobi. With the small savings he had saved from his maize business, Timothy decided to go to the forests to cut wood and bring it to Mlolongo. Since he was successful at the first trial, he decided to open up a timber shop. His shop is very successful, as there are few timber shops in Mlolongo. However, Timothy still has to make frequent trips to the forests near Eldoret (about a five-hour drive from Nairobi) to split wood and bring it back to his shop. Timothy is therefore requesting a Kiva loan of US $1,175 in order to increase his inventory of timber, which would to allow him to remain at his shop without having to make too many frequent trips up-country to gather wood. He is expecting to repay the loan within nine months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":96132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"To
