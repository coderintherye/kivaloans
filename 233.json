Habibullo lives in the town of Isfara along with his family. Through much effort he dedicates himself to the production of potatoes, onions and watermelons. He tends to his crops himself, with the help of one brother.\r\n\r\nOne of Habibullo\u2019s biggest problems is the marketing of his product and, due to distance, he sells his crop piecemeal which reduces his income to support the family. He has asked for a loan of 2,500 Somoni that will be spent on the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. This would allow him greater earnings which, in turn, would improve his family\u2019s standard of living. His biggest desire is to participate in this future venture so he can improve his profits and provide a better life for his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His experience in this business has enabled him to expand his clientele day by day, and now Oromidin is requesting a loan of $500 to purchase more apricots to process  and sell.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

housewives are usually active in helping their husbands in earning income. There are many occupations that were traditionally male dominated are now done by women. K. Zulhayo is an example. She has been farming cattle for the past 3 years. Her earnings even surpassed her husband's who works as a farmer. Her elder son (pictured) helps Zulhayo with the business. So her farm really helps her family's finances tremendously. With a loan from IMON International Zulhayo expects to buy young cattle. She really hopes that she can produce more cows to be sold so she earns more than last year.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

2004, K. Gulom has been a livestock farmer. He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has three children whom he needs to support and give a proper education.\r\n\r\nGulom has improved his financial situation because his father is also a cattle breeder and, from childhood, Gulom has gained a rich experience in the livestock business.\r\n\r\nNowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (such as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. Gulom is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khujayor is 50 years old. He is married and has 5 children. \r\n\r\nKhujayor sells cattle. As a rule he purchases small cattle in the central market, feeds them and then resells them at higher prices in the local market. \r\n\r\nHaving been in this business for 5 years he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. He gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and to generate a considerable, stable income for his large family. \r\n\r\nKhujayor is planning to enlarge the stock and to purchase more cattle. For this purpose he requests $700 that will purchase two young cattle. You can become an important part in Khujayor family's life and he deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and father of two children, Suyunboy K. was born on August 28, 1974. \r\n\r\nComing from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Suyunboy has been selling cattle since 2003. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. \r\n\r\nToday Suyunboy would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting a loan to purchase young cattle. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Boane (Mozambique), in her own home and is not responsible for any additional people.  Maria has studied at the Commercial Institute of Maputo, and is the coordinator of a social organization located in her district, where her monthly salary is 8,000 MZM.\r\n\r\nMaria has sold pots and pans for more than four years, learning the business from her sister-in-law.  The cost of each item varies between 120 and 500 MZM, and her inventory turnover is good.  Maria received information about Hluvuku from friends, who encouraged her to apply for a loan.\r\n\r\nWhile Maria has benefited from loans through other institutions, this is her third loan with Hluvuku.  The first loan from Hluvuku was for 6,000 MZM and the second was for 12,000 MZM; both were applied to her business.  Each loan was repaid based on its terms.  Maria will use this loan to buy a mold to make the pots and pans herself, hiring other workers to help her.  She believes her business will grow by 15,000 MZM with this new investment.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Deborah Delzell, Kiva

Murod is a 49-year-old married man and the loving father of four children. For 13 years Murod has had a small shop near his house where he sells all kinds of household and foodstuff items. His children (one of them is pictured) help him with the business. He dreams that his children will enter higher education, and that is why he is working hard, together with his wife who always assists him in everything. Murod's business is successful in bringing considerable income to the family. Today Murod wants to expand his business and to increase his working capital for purchasing new goods to sell. With this purpose he is requesting a loan of 10,000 TJS. Murod has had loans from Kiva partner IMON several times already and has demonstrated that he is a reliable client. Murod promises to manage this loan reliably as well.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nMore about IMON International\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Muminjon gets up early to bake the lepeshka so that people have fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. All of the input materials such as flour, salt and yeast he purchases in the local market. Now, due to high demand, Muminjon wants to increase the amount of bread he is baking. He is therefore requesting a loan of 2000 TJS to purchase flour, and coal for baking the lepeshka.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

For about six years Askar with his wife have been selling food on the farmer market in the Djaboor-Rasulov region. He travels to the town of Khujand for the goods twice a week. The goods that sell well at this time is sugar and pastas. The season for fruits has begun and the women are getting ready and stocking up for the winter for jams and compotes. Besides that it is the season when farmers work on the land and many residents have relocated to their farms. They stock up with food such as pasta so that they don't have to travel to the markets too often. This is why Askar decided to use the loan to buy sugar and pasta.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":338309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy six bags of sugar and three bags of pasta","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rasulov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Askar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116274,"name":"Nkemdilim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nkemdilim sells phone accessories.

She will also invest part of the money in paying the agricultural workers who help her to harvest the bananas, since every month they pick from 80 to 100 bunches of bananas.\r\n\r\nOne of Rossana's dreams and aspirations is to set up a large grocery store so that she can generate more income and continue contributing to the household income.\r\n\r\nRossana now feels that she is a very accomplished woman who wants to achieve and make her dreams a reality.  She is grateful for the help that the Manuela Ramos organization gave her in starting her business, along with the many other women who want to grow their businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":338330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing banana trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T13:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985539,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205959,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635211,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074276,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989652,"comment":null},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834639,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T14:54:13Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116409,"name":"Akpene","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Akpene M. est une jeune femme de 29 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8r\u00e9 d\u2019un enfant. elle est d\u00e9tentrice d\u2019un bar \u00e0 Lom\u00e9.

He always wanted to have a beautful wedding, but because of economic circumstances, he wasn't able to.  This is why he is living with his long-time girlfriend with whom he formed a family.  They have three children, and one of them has formed his own family already.  He has grown coffee and pineapple for many years, but in the last five years he has started to buy and sell fruit.  He gets up very early every day to search for fruit, buying them from the same farmers so he can sell them.  In this way he makes better income for his home.  Because he has done this for many years, he has met wholesalers, so he doesn't have to go around selling his products anymore; he just goes directly to his wholesaler customers and delivers his products.  His strategy is to be in constant contact with the wholesalers so he doesn't lose his working capital by one of them switching suppliers.  In the near future, Alejandro hopes to buy some land in the city to build a house with more comfort for his family.  This is his fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prismas.  He is the oldest male member in his group, so he is very respected by the other members.  He is the financial chairman of his communal bank.

Para ello, al costado de su bodega, va a implementar un local muy amplio para su taller, donde pueda hacerse muy conocido y gane clientela r\u00e1pidamente. Este es el quinto cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, durante los periodos pasados demostr\u00f3 responsabilidad  de pago; asimismo su cargo como secretario lo ha cumplido cabalmente, siendo reelegido por sus compa\u00f1eros, por lo que promete hacer cumplir todos los acuerdos escritos en el libro de actas de su banco comunal. El dinero que solicita lo va a invertir en la compra de abarrotes para su tienda y con otra parte, planea comprar madera para su carpinter\u00eda.","en":"Felipe is the leader of his community.  He is 54 years of age and happily married to the mother of his five children who are living elsewhere.  Now he has only to care for his six-year-old granddaughter who he adores and who fills each day of his life with happiness.  Conversing with us, he told us about his sorrow at her abandonment by his daughter; how when she asked for her mother, he felt impotent in the face of this reality.  And so, he seeks in his work a way of forgetting this situation.  Together with his wife, he tends the store that they have in their house and which is the primary source of income for their family.  He invests in it, within his abilities, in order to increase the products that they offer.  But what pleases Felipe most are the agricultural jobs.  Although for now he has not been able to do them, he has decided to resume his work as a carpenter, which he did as a young man.  To do so, aside from his grocery store, he is going to set up a very large area for his workshop, where he can make himself well known and win customers quickly.  \r\nThis is the fifth loan that he has had with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  During his past terms he was responsible in making payments.  At the same time he fulfilled his duties as Secretary capably and was re-elected by his partners and he has promised to fulfill all of the written agreements in his Communal Bank's Minutes Book.  The money that he is requesting will be used to purchase groceries for his store, and with part of it going to buy lumber for his carpentry.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":338594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase his merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-21T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3200,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3241.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-21T10:36:24Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116430,"name":"Gerardo Andr\u00e9s","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Gerardo is 22 years old, single and lives in the city of Carapegu\u00e1 in the San Jos\u00e9 district.

He has worked as a mechanic for over 22 years.  He used to be a farmer, but he lost everything when he had a bad harvest.  Then, he had an accident and had to be hospitalized to recover.  He had to sell everything he had to be able to pay the medication costs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Demecio did not stop fighting to get work.  That was when he started to work with his brother who taught him everything about mechanics.  He found that this would be a good business, and he decided to set up a shop at his home.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for is for working capital to buy replacement parts for motorcycles, cars, and bicycles.  He will also buy more tools.

He sews the shoes and gives them the necessary finishings.  She cuts the leather with the appropriate molds.  They both receive orders in quantities from various markets in the area.  They also make custom shoes.  A customer in the market who cannot find shoes they like can go to Felipa\u2019s small shop, and for a greater charge, they will make a shoe the customer likes.  \r\n\r\nShe and her husband have a lot of faith that they will continue to make progress.  They want to buy more machines and set up a very well equipped shop to make shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is their ninth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

She lives in her own house with her husband and her two sons who are 15 and 12 years old. For the past 20 years, she has been making children's shoes. She was encouraged by her husband who had experience in this line of work because he had worked in shoe-making shops from the time he was very young. Together they decided to begin their own business, which has meant much sacrifice. But now it is their main source of income. \r\n\r\nJessica helps her husband in the less difficult tasks. Shoe-making is very difficult work, requiring sewing, cutting, and gluing, and in large quantities because of the number of orders they fill. Each day they make 12 pairs of small shoes, which is no easy feat since they work alone and they can\u2019t stop because by the end of the day they have to deliver the shoes to the Gamarra shopping center (one of the best-known in Lima), which is where they get the most orders. Jessica is very content because thanks to this job she has been able to build her house, which she is improving little by little. She also likes making children\u2019s shoes because they are nicer looking and they can alternate styles and colors.

Every Wednesday she spends 300 soles to purchase sodas and other bottled drinks from a regional distributor. \r\n<p>\r\nIvan is 20 years old and drives commercial vehicles to distribute food and building supplies throughout the Sacred Valley.  It took him two years to receive his commercial driver\u2019s license after passing driving and written tests. With the loan he hopes to buy extra goods that he can transport on the vehicles and sell for extra income.  He currently works for a local transport company, but hopes to own his own truck one day.\r\n<p>\r\nPalccaraqui is grateful for the loan. They have been working with Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa for over a year, and are familiar with the loan process and repayment schedule expected of them. Members guarantee each other in groups of 3 to 4 people to hold each other accountable. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":338677,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":697,"youtube_id":"jQaTJMSCjMg"},"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy powder to make fireworks and to purchase merchandise for other small businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ruben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10100,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2378.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2473.59},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2572.54},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2675.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":788.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":820.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":853.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":788.89,"local_amount":2378.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2378.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139225,"comment":null},{"amount":241.56,"local_amount":728.28,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":728.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564844,"comment":null},{"amount":546.34,"local_amount":1647.18,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998407,"comment":null},{"amount":568.18,"local_amount":1713.02,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1713.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910659,"comment":null},{"amount":590.89,"local_amount":1781.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1781.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103750234,"comment":null},{"amount":614.14,"local_amount":1851.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1851.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110637877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-17T02:09:42Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:02:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116481,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ROSA F.

Rina has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Rina joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rina is now requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her fourth from GDMPC. Rina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her store and to support her family's needs.\n\nAbout GDMPC\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 44 years old and lives and works in Ganchinski district. \r\n\r\nIn his home, he has seven cattle, and his wife, Karomat, helps him raise them. Nabi and Karomat have three children, who are all now studying at school, but in a few years, will be married off. In Tajikistan, it is the responsibility of the parents to raise the children, teach them, marry them off, and support them as long as they are able to. \r\n\r\nNabi, with his first loan from our organization, raised his cattle. And with the increase of his income, he was able to increase the number of cattle he has up to seven heads. \r\n\r\nNow, he would like to take out another loan and gradually increase the number of cattle to 11 heads, which will increase his profit-making ability and ability to support his children. He is requesting 800 somoni to feed his cattle. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":338828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"for cattle fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonjy","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nabi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":116539,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence O. sells cooked foods.

This field is considered to be more profitable in agricultural locales.  Take a cow, for example.  It gives us meat, milk and possibly a calf.  We make dairy products out of milk at home.  Even cow horns are used for making knife handles by our master craftsmen.  And it comes out very nice.  So Arif has cows and sheep at home and makes a good profit from feeding these domestic animals.  His wife, Mavluda, helps him with feeding livestock and processing milk.  They prepare feed for the cows and sheep every day, give them water and milk the cows.  Arif and Mavluda have 5 children: 2 daughters and 3 sons.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This has naturally boosted Mavlyuda\u2019s sales and led to growth in her business.\r\n\r\nMavlyuda is requesting a loan of $3000 to enable her to significantly expand her business by purchasing a new vending facility. She is hoping to reinvest the generated income into further expansion of her business. She believes that consistent growth will help her provide a stable source of income and continue to secure her family\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is very clear about the secret of success in a business. She knows it is the variety of products that she offers because if a client is looking for something that she does not have, he or she may never return to her.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as an ecologist didn't leave enough money to pay the expenses of the family, so Khanifa decided to start her own business five years ago selling the fabrics of the national dresses. Little by little she has made her business grow, and by offering her clients the option of paying in installments, her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally but she would like to continue bettering herself and her business so her situation will be stable in the future.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
