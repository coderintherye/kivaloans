In spite of this she tries to meet the needs of her children alone, and they value their mother's efforts to give them an education. Because of this, Claudia leaves early in the morning for the hospital, where she has worked as a nutritionist for more than 27 years. Claudia is in charge of the menu for hospital patients. On finishing her shift, she goes to work at the recycling stand in the market, where she spends as much time as possible, especially on weekends and holidays. Claudia also spends her time selling beautify products, which she offers to clients and friends. In spite of these multiple efforts, Claudia isn't able to cover the costs of keeping a home, and above all to cover her children's university tuition. It is for this that Claudia is asking for a loan to invest in her recycling stand in order to satisfy the demand of her clients.

She discussed joining the Fund with her husband so that she could ask for a loan to invest into making \"banh da\"- Vietnamese's traditional pancake. Mrs. Dao used an initial loan of 2 millions VND to purchase necessary equipment for her business. And since she was the only \"banh da\" maker in her area at that time, her products were sold like hot cakes. Mrs. Dao plans to invest the next loans into making \"banh da\", which has been a stable source of income for her family. Mrs. Dao has two children, both of whom are still in school but one of them is now old enough to help her with her business. Her husband is a motorbike- driver, with an income of 2 millions VND per month. Combined together, her family income is about 5 millions VND per month.

Before joining TYM Fund, Mrs. N. didn\u2019t have much capital so she had only one pig. But with the loans from TYM Fund, Mrs. N. has been able to expand her business, selling meat from 2 or 3 pigs per day. Besides selling pork retail in the market, Mrs. N. also sells it wholesale to some customers. Mrs. N. has two children, both of whom are grown-up and have jobs. Her family\u2019s daily income is 200000 VND. In the next round of loan, Mrs. N. wishes to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($600) to invest into her business.

Thus, Mrs. Touch P. has decided to request a loan to buy a motorbike with a freezer for her husband to sell ice-cream door-to-door. Last year, one of Mrs. Touch P.\u2019s children got dengue fever and  she spent $175 on medical bills to cure. The additional expense hurt the family budget.

They enjoy their community and are proud to have lived in it since childhood. Amongst the highlights of living in their town is the fact that they all own land there and enjoy a healthy church life and festive season, such as the town fair coming up in early June. The microcredit group that they are part of has brought them closer to each other through \u201cunity and love amongst us,\u201d as Norma G. described her experience.\r\n<P>\tWhen at home or in the workplace, these women, who are mostly mothers, dedicate their lives to weaving. Some are bead-workers and others are dedicated to selling fruit and vegetables.  The weavers make traditional clothing such as colorful belts, aprons and tops (guipiles) and the bead-workers make bead belts and bracelets. They sell this merchandise to intermediaries who take it all over the region and re-sell it to stores, tourists and shoppers. \r\n\t<P>Norma G. began her business a few years ago and took out very small loans at high interest. Recently, she has switched over to loans of virtually no interest, which are generously provided online. She can now confidently take out large loans (and growing) of 340 USD and with it help pay the wages of her 6 employees who work with her to produce many more products than before, and sell them for cheaper, while still making a profit.\r\n\t<P>When asked about how their business was going, they complained about the rainy season and the drop in sales during this time of the year. They said that this lull in sales didn\u2019t mean less work, but a whole other load to be taken care of.  The credit that they receive from microlenders goes towards more cloth and string, which they can buy by bulk and get a cheaper deal.

They are happy to work in their group since they help each other by reminding of payment and meeting dates. They are happy to live in San Pedro and to have businesses there.  \r\n\t<P>These women are dedicated to weaving microenterprises. They weave local vestige items such as guipils and cortes (pictured in group photo)and sell them to a local consumer market in San Pedro and Santiago. Sometimes they set up their own locals or stands at the town markets that meet once a week; if not, they sell to intermediaries who then distribute their products to the region\u2019s towns.\r\n\t<P>Magdalena A. described her process as a cycle, where she invests in materials such as thread dyes and machinery,  producing more finished items for less. She then sells them for larger profits, and takes the extra profits for living, while reinvesting the remainder.  In this manner she hopes to nurture her business to reach a level where profits are large enough to perpetuate the cycle on its own without the need of loans, and of course, with a much more comfortable living standard for her, her husband and her children. Her children all attend school and she hopes to be able to continue to send them to school without interruption. \r\n\t<P>They expressed contentment with the help that the loans have brought their businesses, yet are frustrated by the slump in sales caused by the rainy season and the lull caused by the global economy.  Nevertheless, the vast majority of these San Pedro women are content with the rate of growth that they have achieved with their businesses and that that they expect to achieve with the continual help of these essential loans. \r\n\t<P>The general consensus was that this money would go towards more base materials such as thread, dyes and weaving equipment. They need the loan more than ever due to the slump in profits. With the extra capital, they will hopefully be able to continue a comfortable life, produce the same amounts of items (guipils generally take about two weeks to make and cortes take about 3, according to Jesus C.) despite their lows in sales. \r\nThere was no complaints about market oversaturation and harsh competition, as they mostly enjoy of sales to intermediaries who find the best markets, or other towns which lack weavers of the same sort. \r\n<P>The majority of these business owners agreed that their main priority was raising healthy and happy children who can go to school full time, without having to help the family with work. They were proud to tell me that all of their children go to school (they are all mothers except two.) Apart from children, they look to maintain a balance between dependence on their husbands and making a share of the profits, according to Gloria C., to prove themselves for their own satisfaction, their husbands and larger family. \r\n<P>Gloria and others look forward to the day that the hard work of profit reinvestment will lead them to a large, healthy business which is independent and functions with a smooth cycle, no longer in need of loans for their growth and profits. The profits, although simply an economic term to them, are synonymous with a future happy and prosperous family life and children who go on to beat most of the troubles that their parents are currently battling to go beyond."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":179522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase of thread, dyes, weaving equipment by bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro la Laguna, Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.266667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-07-11T09:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-26T18:43:26Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":18500,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.08},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1423.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193,"local_amount":1428.2,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1438.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307101,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":193,"local_amount":1428.2,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1438.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338158,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":191,"local_amount":1413.4,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1423.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371966,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Friendship Bridge -

He never went to school but he is quite smart and has considerable entrepreneurship skills.  He is married and the father of 6 children.  Khan has an auto spare parts shop.  He\u2019s been in this business for more than 3 decades.  However, he did not own such a shop all the time but worked for others especially during a decade as a refugee in Iran.  The household returned to Afghanistan a few years ago.<P>\r\n\r\nKhan has applied for an individual loan to expand his inventory for his auto spare parts shop.  He initially invested 50,000 Afghani (about US$ 1,100) but just a few years after his return from Iran, his capital has grown by as much as six times.  With this loan he is intending to purchase extra spare parts for his shop, parts which many customers demand  but that he does not have on his shelves.  The loan money will definitely, he believes, increase profitability for his venture.  <P>One of Khan\u2019s wishes in his life is to support his son\u2019s dream of going to college outside Afghanistan, especially in the western countries.

When joining the fund, the family made plans to invest in raising livestock, and with the income from this business they built milling machines.  They then used the milling machines to process waste wheat and rice for the pigs, so the cost of feed is kept very low.  Each year, on average, the family produces about 500 kg of pigs.  Doing business involving the livestock operation fits the family very well, their finances are improving day by day.  She has 3 children, 2 who are still in school and 1 who is working and helping to support the family.  In this round of funding she and the family are requesting 16,000,000 to continue investing in livestock.

Thi Nguyen, 58 years old, joined the Fund in 2001.  Her family\u2019s situation is very unfortunate; her husband passed away, leaving her to raise their one child by herself.  The child is now grown and live at home with Mrs. Nguyen.  When she first joined the Fund, the family invested in livestock.  In every round of funding the family used the money successfully and brought in a large income.  Currently she is investing the funding in general store run out of her home, and it is truly a business venture that brings strong results with high incomes.  In her town, there are very few people running general stores, so the majority of the townspeople buy goods from her family\u2019s store.  Although her family situation was in a very desperate state, thanks to her perseverance the family\u2019s finances are now very much improved.  In this round of funding she is requesting 18,000,000 VND to continue investing in the general store.  Their average income is 5,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean 58 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2001 ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3, ch\u1ed3ng m\u1ea5t s\u1edbm m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 nu\u00f4i 1 con hi\u1ec7n nay con ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh v\u00e0 ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng con, khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 ch\u1ecb vay v\u1ed1n c\u0169ng \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, qua c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng c\u00f3 hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 cho thu nh\u1eadp cao.

She is single with six children and she cares for her sister who is in a tailoring school in Gayaza. Of her children, two are out of school and managing their own families while four are studying.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam's business is selling used clothing including bed sheets, curtains and nets. She has done this for 15 years. She transacts her business by moving from one busy location to another to daily markets around her home area. She buys her stock in bales from Kampala once every week and business is good. People like secondhand clothes because they are unique and long lasting unlike new clothes.

Her husband  Eustache HOUNDJO is an accountant who lost his job several months ago.  Ms.  Bertille A. is a seamstress by training and has been residing in the A\u00cfDJEDO district for eleven years.  For seven years, she has been selling ready-to-eat meals in a private educational complex in her district.  She is also a distributor of various goods, namely damask fabrics, soap, rice, pagne (traditional print cloth), vegetable oil, and other products.  This second business activity that, in the beginning, she used to do only during vacation time, has become something daily, since her husband lost his accountant's job.  She makes her purchases in the Dantokpa marketplace and also in Lom\u00e9 in TOGO.  As a result of financial difficulties tending to handicap improvements in her businesses, she had come to take on an initial loan of 60,000 francs CFA in 2007.  Because of her very fruitful initial experience, she requested and obtained her second loan, which she repaid successfully.  She comes now to request a third loan of 150,000 francs CFA for the purposes of meeting her customers' expectations.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\nN\u00e9e le 09\/11\/1966 \u00e0 Cotonou dans le d\u00e9partement du Littoral, dame A.
