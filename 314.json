 F. is a 57-year-old woman living in the town of Taga.  She is married and has 6 adult children.  To make a living, Leatuvai  owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Leatuvai  has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leatuvai  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Leatuvai  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Leatuvai  is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will also be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Leatuvai  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay tuition fees for her children.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Seela has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Seela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Seela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1500 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  Seela is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase more fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Seela plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 34 and is the mother of 2 children who are 3 and 14.  The oldest one goes to school.  She studied until secondary school and didn't continue because she wasn't admitted to college.  She lives in her own home in Boane with her children and supports her mother and niece by sending them money every month.<p>\r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha for Boane in 1992 and teaches primary school there.  She has worked for the Ministry of Education for 7 years.  She received a degree from the Instituto de Magist\u00e9rio Prim\u00e1rio in Matola and works 8 hours a day.

This is her second loan, and it is for 13,000 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials like cement, iron, pipes, and sewer equipment to put plumbing in her home.  Her previous loan was for 13,000 meticais and was used for the same purpose. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to request more loans to be able to improve and expand her home more so she can offer better living conditions to her children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

He is 32, is married, and is the father of a 4-year-old son.  He only studied through the 8th grade and didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and a niece.  He still supports his mother, who lives in his siblings' house by sending her money to help with her expenses.<p>\r\n\r\nHe has never left Boane.  After he built his home, he lived with his family there.  He has worked as a cashier at a gas station called Petromoc for 5 years.  Besides this formal job, he also has his own business where he sells alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and other items.  Through this activity, he earns 5,000 meticais per month that he uses to pay for his family's expenses and also saves some in the commercial bank, BIM.<p>\r\n\r\nHe has had loans with an association called Gu\u00ea-gue-gue (a community bank with savings and credit), but not feeling comfortable with the methodology of support groups, he decided to stop.  Later, through friends' comments, he heard about Hluvuku and decided to approch them to find out about their practices.  This is his 4th loan, and it is for 12,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy products like wine, beer, soft drinks, juice, etc., to increase his merchandise.  His previous loans were for 4,200, 7,200, and 10,000 meticais, and they were all used for the same activity.<p>\r\n\r\nAs a goal for this loan, he wants to improve the food situtation in his home and to support the education of his wife and son.  In the future, he hopes to request more loans to finish his home and to offer more comfort to his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

Trabalha como operador de m\u00e1quinas pesadas numa pedreira desde 1961 e tem um sal\u00e1rio mensal de 4.600.00mt que aplica nas despesas familiares e ainda poupa algum na sua pr\u00f3pria casa. A esposa faz venda de produtos de primeira necessidade, como forma de incrementar a receita familiar.\n\nNunca teve empr\u00e9stimos com outros bancos, conheceu a Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s de amigos, e este \u00e9 o seu 3\u00ba empr\u00e9stimo no valor de 10.000.00mt com o qual pretende comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o (ferro, cimento, areia e outros) para dar continuidade com a sua obra. Os empr\u00e9stimos anteriores foram de 5.00,00mt e 10.000,00mt para com\u00e9rcio e habita\u00e7\u00e3o, respectivamente.\n \nNo futuro gostaria de solicitar mais empr\u00e9stimos para concluir a sua obra e oferecer melhor conforto para a sua fam\u00edlia.\n\n\n\n","en":"Armando Andreasse Manombo was born in the district of Marracuene in the province of Maputo.  He is 59, married, and the father of 10 children whose ages he doesn't remember.  Three of his children go to school.  He only studied through 4th grade of the old education system and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and also supports 2 grandchildren that live with him.<p>\r\nHe left Marracuene for the district of Boane many years ago with his family in search of better living conditions.  He has worked as a heavy equipment operator in a quarry since 1961 and makes a monthly salary of 4,600 meticais.  He uses this money to pay for his family's expenses and still saves some at his house.  His wife sells basic products as a way of increasing their family's income. <p>\r\nHe has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through friends.  This is his 3rd loan, and it is for 10,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (iron, cement, sand, etc) to finish building his home.  His previous loans were for 5,000 and 10,000 meticais and were used for his business and his home, respectively.<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to request more laons to finish his home and to offer more comfort to his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She is 51, married, and the mother of 2 children who are 32 and 18.  Both of them work and don't go to school.  She only studied through the 3rd grade and didn't continue because of her parents' lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her family and doesn't support anyone besides them.  She never left Maputo.  She has a business where she has sold food products for more than 15 years.  She has a sales volume of 15,000 meticais a month and earns a monthly income of 3,500 meticais a month, which she uses to support her family, pay for credit, and saves some in her bank account.  She has never had a loan with another establishment.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her friends, and this is her 5th loan, which is for 12,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy construction materials (cement, stone, sand, and labor) to expand her home.  Her previous loans were for 6,000, 6,000, 7,200, and 11,200 meticais, which she used to purchase furniture, appliances, and other domestic goods.  In the future, she hopes to request more loans so she can continue expanding her home and to buy more furniture for it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She is 44; a widow; and the mother of 6 children who are 29, 27, 21, 17, 15, and 5.  Three of her children are in school.  She only studied through the 4th grade of the old educational system and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her children and also supports her mother by sending her food.  She never moved from her city.  She married her husband when she was 17 and started her business 3 years ago as a way of increasing her family's income.  She makes a trip every week to South Africa or Swaziland, where she buys her products.  She has a sales volume of 20,500 meticais and sells potatoes, white wine, and onions.  She earns around 10,000 meticais per month and applies it to her home's expenses and saves some through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has had loans with other credit institutions but decided to switch for various reason.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a neighbor.  This is her third loan, and it is for 10,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy products (potatoes, onions, grapes, etc) to increase her quantity of merchandise.  Her previous loans were for 4,500, 5,000, and 7,500 meticais and were all used for the same activity.  In the future, she hopes to request more loans to finish her home and to strenghthen her business further.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":349.94,"image":{"id":435058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase food products (potatoes, onions, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.68,"local_amount":1047.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1074.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709093,"comment":null},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":1041.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1067.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938231,"comment":null},{"amount":42.48,"local_amount":1213.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1244.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938232,"comment":null},{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":1116.76,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1144.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.06,"payment_id":128972077,"comment":null},{"amount":43.67,"local_amount":1247.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1279.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698652,"comment":null},{"amount":151.63,"local_amount":4332.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4441.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916105,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T17:54:15Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156902,"name":"Fatimo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatimo is 40 years old.

He has had this business for five years and was previously employed in someone else's shop.  \r\n\r\nHis biggest business challenge is that he needs more machines, particularly a pressing machine, to produce more clutch facings. He is using his 50,000 Kenyan shilling loan to purchase raw materials. His goal is for his shop to grow and employ more mechanics.  \r\n\r\nHenry is married and has a boy and a girl, ages 8 months and 3 years. His dream in life is that his children get a good education.

truly has the mindset of an entrepreneur. When her daughter was born, she was inspired to use her talent for sewing to make unique clothes and accessories for her rather than buy them. Soon after, her children's clothing business took off, and she was selling and sharing her handmade items with others. Kelly draws her inspiration from her daughter, who models most of her designs, and she is also helped by her supportive husband, who from time to time helps her with various sewing tasks. <P>\r\n\r\nKelly always feels successful when she receives emails from her customers thanking her for her work, and telling her how much their children love the outfits. She is always striving to offer new designs and meeting the ever-changing needs of her customers. She will use her loan from ACCION USA to purchase additional machines for making her items, fabric and t-shirt inventory, embroidery designs, and marketing. This is Kelly's first time obtaining a loan for her business - in the past, she had always used funds from previous sales to buy supplies, but was always just breaking even.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Kelly hopes her company will be able to produce all of her customer's needs, like accessories, bags, and even shoes, becoming a \"one-stop shop.\" She would also like to eventually hire an employee to assist her in production.

He has successfully made a steady income since then, but he says one of the main challenges of being a taxi driver is keeping his vehicle in good shape. Since he drives it all day, it is constantly breaking down. Now, he is going to use his loan from ACCION USA to pay for repairs to his car. He is a return client, but has also used credit cards to pay for repairs in the past. With credit cards, he tries to pay his full balance at the end of the month because of the high interest charges.\r\n<p>\r\nRamon does not want to be a taxi driver forever - he has big dreams to open his own business one day, in an entirely different industry  - a restaurant! He hopes that when he decides to do this and has saved enough money, he will be able to get help from ACCION USA to start up the business.\r\n<p>\t\t\t\r\nMore about ACCION USA and the underbanked in the United States\r\n<p>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent on a monthly basis got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current  \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low-income neighborhoods and rebuild the U.S. economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides low to moderate income workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6400,"image":{"id":434260,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1452,"youtube_id":"aglweCglLDY"},"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repairs

He sells various kinds of cheese and cream which he distributes to different restaurants, grocery stores and employees of companies in the country; they sell for both cash and credit.  Her goal is to increase stock with such things as rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, milk, which are the items most sold on a daily basis, so that her profits will improve.  She has a 6-month-old baby and, because she got married, was unable to finish her studies which she plans to restart next year in order to attain better social and economic stability so that she can give her daughter the best.  She hopes to accomplish this since lack of funds and the arrival of her baby complicated things and she did not finish.

During most of her life she has raised small farm animals in her mother's house and three years ago began to sell them in the city of Chiclayo.  She raises turkeys, ducks, guinea pigs, and mutton.  She usually travels to the city twice a week to sell them.  Dominga tells us that demand for her animals has been growing but that she does not have enough animals to meet it.

He needs 1000 new soles to buy metal sheeting to build a roof for his house because the continuous rains of last year greatly weakened his present roof and it will not stand up to the rains this Summer.  Jhony is a responsible, very cheerful and helpful father.  His greatest wish is to be able to see that his children can go to school and study a career with which they can support themselves in the future.

Living up to these personal expectations gives her courage to bear paying the interest rate required by ASHI for every loan she requests and attending the weekly center meetings. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is also determined to grow her business and profits to be able to meet the demands of her family, which includes five children, whose ages range from three to 15. Maria wants to earn enough business profit, in addition to her husband\u2019s sporadic income being a farm laborer, that she will be able to support the education of her children until they graduate from college. \r\n<p>\r\nThe opportunity ASHI offers for poor women to access loans for a business is Maria\u2019s key to achieving her dreams in life, and people around the world wanting to support her endeavor gives her reason to hold on to her

Ramona E. is requesting a loan through ASHI to buy cattle to raise and breed.

She also wants to support her previous and ongoing business, which is manufacturing \u201cnipa\u201d (a leaf of a palm) as a native roofing material through her loan. Proceeds of this business supply Ramona and her family with their daily basic needs. Her husband is a just a laborer and his income is too small for Ramona and her three children to depend on. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the all of her problems at home brought about by poverty, Ramona\u2019s membership in ASHI had helped her in so many ways aside from having access to loans. The camaraderie she had found from among her co-members in ASHI has diverted her disappointments to happiness. She found herself laughing at problems and later on realized laughter was a very good solution for them. Despite the many adversities she has encountered, Ramona has remained strong and determined to achieve her dreams for her three children, who are aged from eight to 12 years

As Zaida intends to do in her tailoring, her husband wants not to just capture the special moments of his customers and carefully bring them to their desired destinations, but he also wants their children to taste the best offerings of life and to be able to reach their own dreams someday. Zaida feels very blessed having a husband and children that are very supportive and loving. With that, she courageously took the risk in growing her business and has gotten larger loans through ASHI. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan Zaida is requesting now, she wants to put up her own dress shop and purchase a large volume of textiles needed for her business. She is not only the one that is excited to see her business growing; her husband and two children are exited too.

the death of her husband a long time ago, Rita D. faces life\u2019s challenges brought about by poverty alone, working to enable her two children to survive. Now she is 55 years of age and still facing a lot of adversities in life that sometimes makes her weak. However, the thought of her children having low educational attainment and less opportunity to get a good employment enables her to regain strength to continue fighting and win the battle against poverty. Her eldest child is 31 years old and has an income from driving a tricycle (a motorcycle with a sidecar that is used as people\u2019s means of transportation), which Rita bought using a previous loan; her younger child is 27 years old and a waiter. \r\n<p>\r\nStill, Rita wants to have her own business and help her children. She hopes that her business of fattening cattle (a cow can be sold for as much double its price after two to three years) will grow and becomes sustainable someday through loans she can obtain from ASHI with the support of its partner, Kiva. Rita knew that, because she is poor, her children have nothing to inherit when her life is over, but having a sustainable business for them to manage and continue will enable them to be more secure in

M. has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,452,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  M. is now requesting a new loan of 5,450,000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n<p>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nM.

C. is a 52-year-old single woman who lives in Pinagkamaligan, Tanay Rizal. She blessed with two sons and two daughters. The eldest is 20 years old and youngest is 8 years old.  Two of her children are in college students and the rest are in elementary grades. \r\n<p>\r\nLolita has been in the business of buying and selling jewelry and accessories for almost 10 years now, since she received her first loan from ASHI, which amounted to Php 5,000. Now, Lolita wishes to apply for her 8th loan from ASHI, amounting to Php 20,000, to be used in the same business. With the bigger loan, the volume of commodities she will sell will be increased and she can help many people from her village have access to commodities with less effort and time. \r\n<p>\r\nLolita is very optimistic that she will be able to manage her business well and have it grow. She hopes to provide a better education for her children. All of these children she has right now are just a couple of adopting from her nearest relatives. As a single old woman, she believes that there will be nobody to take care of her when she becomes very old unless she has money; that\u2019s why she still makes great effort to seek opportunities to have savings for her old age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":435548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (10102130026) is a 44-year-old female living in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 n\u1ed9i.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, X. operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising fish for sale.  X. has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, X. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  X. successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,876,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  X. is now requesting a new loan of 5,014,000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  X. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n<p>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nX.

She lives in the active town of Tanay, in the Rizal province in the Philippines. She is married to Ariel, who is 38 years old and a driver.\n\nRowena came to her mind of joining ASHI for the dreams and a bridge to support her in her business.  She needed to work and look for a living to support the needs of her children because the business became the main source of income and she receives good income for their future savings in case of emergency. She also earns extra income from her pedicure and manicure business. In 2006; she decided to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During her membership in ASHI, she was noted for her excellent performance in terms of responding to her responsibilities in the organization.\n\nNow Rowena is requesting a loan of Php20,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for  perfumes, towels, underwear for men and women, blouses, jeans, t-shirts, shoes, bags, slippers, and many others similar items. She has regular customers and she also receives and accepts orders.\n\nRowena hopes to send her children to school until they finish college and find the finest jobs. She also hopes to expand her business and be able to have more stock. She also dreams of having her own AVON Dealer outlet and to have own house and lot.  She even aspires to having a space in the market.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":435563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

C. is from the village of San Vicente Bajo, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. She is 50 years old. Valeriana is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Valeriana owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" retail store, a type of variety store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Valeriana has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Valeriana joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Valeriana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. Valeriana is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Valeriana from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 34 years old. Ma Joyce is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Ma Joyce owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector raising pigs. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling pigs in the local community. Ma Joyce has been engaged in her business for more than 20 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ma Joyce joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma Joyce has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,500 PHP from GDMPC. Ma Joyce is requesting a new loan of 3,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional piglets for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Ma Joyce from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Mailag, Valencia City, Bukidnon. She is 56 years old. Nathaniela is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Nathaniela owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling Ready to Wear items and cosmetics in the local community. Nathaniela has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nathaniela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nathaniela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Nathaniela is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Nathaniela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After several years of training, she finished by developing her own business buying and selling food condiments, an activity that she has run for 30 years now, and which enjoys an excellent reputation.\r\nShe sells her goods at the market in M\u00e9dine. Her sales location is at the centre of the market, next to the meat sellers.\r\nWith the goal of increasing her profits, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso (one of Kiva's field partners), with whom she is on her first individual loan.\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy 10 bags of okra, 3 bags of peppers, and 2 bags of head cabbage. She obtains her supplies in Loulouni in the Sikasso region.\r\nMs. Kadia Traor\u00e9 sells her goods in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of women and men.\r\nWith this loan, she foresees realizing a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA. This profit will allow her to take care of her needs (buying soap, food, and clothing).\r\nHer ambition is to repay this loan and start a new business cycle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

Mabini, Valladolid, Negros Occidentala, is a 51-year-old woman who prays to the Lord to give her strength, good  health and long life to continue her business and help her family. Her husband is a farmer who plants different kinds of vegetables and manages their small rice farm. The couple has four adult children  between 24 and 31 years old. Glenda strives hard in her business to not only support their household needs but also to be financially independent.<p>\r\n\r\nGlenda started her business in 2002 when she joined  NWTF-Project Dungganon to borrow capital to put up a general store adjacent to her house. As soon as her first loan was granted, she bought a variety of items and products to sell, and any extra income from the store is always used to buy more goods to sell. As her loans have continued, she has also helped her husband by buying fertilizers for his vegetables and rice farm. Glenda also sells her husband's vegetable harvest in the local market and in the neighboring villages. Her business is going well, earning an average income of Php 10,000 per month.<p>\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 10,000, fully repaid without delay, was used as additional working capital for her general store.  Because of her good credit performance, she can borrow a larger amount, and this time around she is borrowing Php 15,000 for her 14th cycle loan to be utilized as revolving working capital for her general store and to purchase additional fertilizer for their vegetable and rice farm. The income from this loan will be used for house repairs. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in  the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":435454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy new

They live in Ndumberi, just outside of Kiambu. Together they run a 'posho' mill business (they grind maize into powder\/flour). From this business they generate about 20,000 KES a month. The business is 5 years old.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Michael's second loan from KADET, and with it he will purchase additional maize stock so that he can continue to run his 'posho' mill business. The first loan he took out from KADET was used to purchase hardware supplies. In the face of Kenya's massive drought, Michael and Nancy were hit hard. To combat this, Michael did some research and found a market for hardware supplies in Nukuru (about 2 hours' drive). He used his first loan to become a hardware supplier to the Nukuru area. He continues this business and leans on Nancy to run the 'posho' mill business in his absence. <P>\r\n\r\nMichael dreams of buying a better 'posho' mill machine that will mill the maize finer.

He is 50, a widow, and the father of 2 children who are 14 and 16.  Both of them go to school.  He studied through 11th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his children and doesn't support anybody else.  He left Chimoio in 1977 to complete his military service.  After he finished his military career, he joined the Ministry of the Interior where he still works 8 hours a day.  He has a monthly salary of 16,434 meticais, which he applies to his family's expenses and saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through colleagues.  This is his first loan in the amount of 10,500 meticais, which he will use to buy construction materials (doors and windows) to continue building his home.  In the future, he would like to request more loans to be able to start a business to help with his home's expenses, so he promises to pay back this loan without any problems.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":435762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials (doors, windows, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando Joao","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10500,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":476.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":496.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":516.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":538.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":560.26},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":583.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607.26},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":632.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":658.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":685.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":713.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":742.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":773.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":805.03},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":838.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":872.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.9},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":1797.26,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1827.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709094,"comment":null},{"amount":58.36,"local_amount":1750.74,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938233,"comment":null},{"amount":30.17,"local_amount":905,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":920.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938234,"comment":null},{"amount":29.18,"local_amount":875.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":890.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972078,"comment":null},{"amount":172.38,"local_amount":5171.48,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T17:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157243,"name":"Khady","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Khady N. est mari\u00e9e, elle a 41 ans et 8 enfants en charges dont 6 qui fr\u00e9quent l'\u00e9cole.

He is 51 and is the father of 4 children who are 27, 24, 21, and 12.  Only the youngest one is in school.  He studied through 4th grade of the old education system.  He didn't continue because he was drafted into obligatory military service.  He lives in his own home with his family in the Zona Verde neighborhood (on the outskirts of the city of Matola) and doesn't support anyone besides them.  He left Massinga for Beira in 1977 to comply with his obligatory military service.  Later he was transferred to Maputo where he started his home.  Currently he is out of the military and has worked in the Central Hospital of Maputo for more than two years by disinfecting it.  He makes a monthly income of 2,052 meticais from his military pension and 2,186.74 meticais a month from the hospital.  He also makes 1,100 meticais a month by working at a clinic.  He has bank accounts in two commercial banks.  He already had a loan with another institution whose name he doesn't remember.  His loan was for 3,000 meticais, and he used it to buy construction materials for his home.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his colleagues who are also clients of the institution.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku, and it is for 10,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy construction materials (metal sheets and bars) to put a roof on his home.  He promises to pay back his loan on time so he can receive more loans in the future to make improvements to his home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":435778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To purchase construction materials (metal sheets, bars, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.9},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":1767.12,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709095,"comment":null},{"amount":121.16,"local_amount":3461.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3695.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938235,"comment":null},{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":1771.04,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1890.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938236,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T07:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3202.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T17:41:47Z","paid_date":"2010-04-17T07:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157250,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan is a 29-year-old man who lives in Tyre, in southern Lebanon, with his wife and their child.

He is 54; married; and the father of 3 children who are 18, 16, and 11.  All of them are in school.  He studied through 7th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the Matola neighborhood and doesn't support anyone besides them.  He left Chibuto for Matola in 1962 with his parents when they were transferred here.  He has had his own business for more than 15 years.  He works with his wife for close to 10 hours a day.  He makes a monthly income of about 13,000 meticais and applies it to his home's expenses and also saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his neighbor who is also a client of the institution.  This is his first loan in the amount of 11,500 meticais, and he will use it to buy products (oleo, rice, sugar, drinks, etc.) to strengthen his quantity of merchandise.  He promises to pay back this loan on time so he will be able to receive more credits in the future.  He will use them to improve and diversify his business more and more.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

This is his second loan in the amount of 10,000MT with which he intends to purchase construction materials (cement blocks and sand) so he can continue with his work.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to solicit additional loans to be able to begin commercial activities with the objective of increasing his family earnings and completing the construction of his home.

She is 44; divorced; and the mother of 6 children who are 21, 17, 15, 13, 9, and 3.  Five of them are in school.  She studied through 10th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her children in Boane and also supports her nephew who lives with her. <p>\r\nShe left Morumbene for Chowke (in the province of Gaza) in 1984 with her husband when he was transferred there for his job.  In 1986, he was transferred to Boane, where they started their home.  Later she separated from her husband, and she continues to live in the same home with her children.  She has worked as a community health worker at an orphanage (which is called Casa de Gaiato) for more than 8 years and has a monthly salary of 3,500 meticais, which she applies to her home's expenses and still saves some in the commercial bank, BCI.<p>\r\nShe has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her colleages, who are also clients of the institution.  This is her second loan, and it is for 8,500 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, and to pay for labor) to continue expanding her home.  Her previous loan was for 7,000 meticais, which she used for the same purpose.<p>\r\nIn the future, she hopes to request more loans to be able to finish her home and to give more comfort to her

R. is 40 years old and her husband Reynald works as a motorcycle driver but sometimes helps his wife sell different kinds of food in the bus terminal. The couple is blessed with 9 children who are aged 2 to 23 years old, 8 of whom are attending school. She only wants for her children to finish their studies, to be able to help her husband to generate additional income for the family to sustain their household needs and to have an economically independent life.\r\n\r\nCristita started her food vending business in 1993. She sold different kinds of food around their local community for 3 years, then she saw that she had a bigger opportunity to sell her food products to people in the bus terminal. In 1996, she concentrated most of her operations around the Sagay City bus terminal. She sold the most likely food that travelers would buy to eat while they traveled or as a gift for their families and friends.\r\n\r\nHer income from selling food at the terminal was so successful, she soon realized she needed bigger capital just to have enough inventory of the products she sold. This motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002. With the additional income from her loans, she was able to increase her income capacity in turn. Now she earns about PHP 12,000 per month on average and she has been setting aside some money for the education of her children after providing for their household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used as additional capital for her food vending business and it helped her sustain her volume level and generate good income for her family. Now for her 10th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to continue to sustain her business' capital requirement and maintain momentum in her food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":435662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To obtain

Consolacion and her family live in Prk. Pag-asa, Poblacion 2, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. In spite of her advancing years, Consolacion works hard so that she can continue to earn a good living for her family, not only for their immediate needs, but also for when she and her husband are old and no longer able to work for a living. Consolacion also hopes that by sustaining a stable business now, her child will be able to continue with the business in the future.\r\n\r\nConsolacion started her RTW (ready-to-wear clothes) business in 1975 to have a stable source of income for their small family. This was her only source of income for many years, then at some point, she had to shift to another business venture because the RTW business was not doing as well. So she invested in a food vending business making specialty rice-cakes called \"bibingka\", made with rice flour, coconut, and sugar, and cooked on a top-fired oven.  When RTW became in demand again, Consolacion shifted back to her RTW business, selling clothes from a rented stall in the Sagay City Central Market.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, she again experienced some financial difficulties as some of her capital had to be spent on the tuition fees of her child who was at the time attending college. But her cash flow problem was solved when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon where she was able to borrow the necessary capital to sustain her business operations, and, as the years passed, has allowed her to expand her product lines with access to bigger loans because of her good credit record. Consolacion earns an average of PHP 30,000 monthly from her RTW business, and she saves a majority of this amount towards her \"retirement fund\" so that she and her husband will not be a burden to their child in later years.\r\n\r\nConsolacion's previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used to buy new stock for their business and she was able to pay that loan as usual without any problems. Now for her 11th loan cycle, she is borrowing the same amount so that she can continue to restock her store with new fashions for her customers.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Life around the city can be difficult with little access to reliable electricity and running water. It is also crowded and polluted because of insufficient sanitation efforts by the government. Despite any difficulties he may face, Eliberto runs a successful shop from his home selling clothes. He plans to use this loan, his very first from Esperanza International, to purchase new shoes, shirts, and pants for women and men. He will then sell the clothes to his friends and neighbors at a small markup.\r\n\r\nEliberto is very grateful for his newfound access to financial services such as loans and savings, as well as health services for his family. He hopes to continue expanding his business, and he hopes to own his own shop one day. Eliberto has three children from nine to fourteen, and he also hopes to send them all to university with the extra profits from his business.

She and her family live in Batey El Fao, a small rural community northwest of San Pedro. Bateyes are small communities built by sugar companies for their workers. They typically have poor housing, scarce electricity, and unreliable running water that is never potable. With the profits from her business over the years, Maria has been able to construct her own home from cement block, a significant improvement over the typical local home. \r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza. She plans to use the loan to purchase rice, beans, oil, and other staple foods for her small colmado, or general store. She came to Esperanza because she likes the borrowing model based on holistic development. Maria not only receives loans, but also savings and health services for her family, among other things. She hopes that with the profits from this loan, she will move closer to her dream of sending her children to college. With your help, Maria can reach that goal. Thank you for lending to Maria and the Unidas para el Progreso

Once married, she has worked to have her own home.  She had three children and has had to support them alone because, like happens in so many families, she is a single mother.  The hardest work she's done is as a domestic where salaries are very low, work is very hard, and one is subject to many humiliations.  She lives in Managua's Laureles Sur neighborhood.  Little by little she managed to build her house, which is very unassuming, partly made of wood that is in very poor shape.  She wants to buy building materials so that she can start to improve the worst parts like the roof which needs to be replaced because in Winter it leaks.  Also, her fence has fallen and, because of lack of funds, she has been unable to repair it.  The improvements she has made have been thanks to the financing which she can repay bit by bit.  This allows her to make improvements and still be able to pay for basic needs like food and medicine (she's not insured).  She thanks Afodenic for making her home improvements possible.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Bateyes are typically very hard to reach, have no potable water, and little to no electricity. Santa Lucia is a particularly small and isolated batey, but despite the difficulties, Maria makes the most out of her opportunities by selling clothing to her neighbors. Since the community is small and people need new clothing only so often, Maria will also use this loan to purchase food to cook meals for her friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn sugarcane-based communities, during six months of the year there is little work to be done. This time is called \u201cTiempo Muerto\u201d, or dead time. Maria says that it is during this time that she especially needs her business. Once \u201cLa Safra\u201d (the harvest) starts, her family is not as desperate for income. She has smartly balanced her business around the growing season, taking out more money during Tiempo Muerto than during La Safra.

Though there is a good customer base, there is a lot of competition for these stores. \r\n<p>\r\nMaria says that her business has grown little by little and because of it, she has been able to improve her house and generally improved her quality of life. Maria dreams of having a large store that she can pass on to her children so that they will have a way to support themselves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":436035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They had the bright idea of setting up micro enterprises, putting their best skills forward in the tasks that they knew the best.  They work making clothing knit out of wool and cotton thread, cosmetology, selling food in the streets, and selling shoes.  In these businesses Jhovana Asensio and Rosenda S. will tell us their experiences.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Jhovana.  I\u2019m 40 years old and have 2 children, one 14 and the other 2.  I had to work because my husband\u2019s work was sporadic so we couldn\u2019t count on a regular income.  I used my skill as a seamstress (dressmaking and embroidery) to make children\u2019s clothing: polo shirts, jackets, and pants on a sewing machine that my husband had given me when we were going together.  In the beginning I wasn\u2019t making any money but this didn\u2019t stop me from continuing with what I knew how to do best.  One day the noise from the sewing machine prompted the curiosity of my neighbors and they started bringing me clothing to alter and to make.  This helped me a lot and I became known and then started making school uniforms for their children.  This started a siD. business and I began to make uniforms for another school and I also sold shoes.  With this work I needed a semi-industrial sewing machine to fill my orders and that brought me to EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD to ask for a loan.  That helped me greatly because I could buy what I needed and subsequent loans helped me invest in materials for embroidery, fabric, patterns, sponge rubber, gold thread and all colors of thread that are used in typical clothing of the Peruvian mountains.  All the hard work and perseverance enabled me to buy a sandwich cart.  Every night I would go outsiD. my house and sell food such as hamburgers, roasted chickens. I\u2019ve stopped this until my youngest child, the 2 year old, grows a little more.  The profits that I have maD. from my businesses have solved, paying for my family\u2019s food, and also for the school expenses, particularly of my daughter, especially when my husband doesn\u2019t have any work.  I have also been able to build our little thatched house out of good materials so that my children are much more comfortable-which they need.  The loan that I would like to have is to buy, shoes, boots and slippers for my customers\u2019 orders.  My goal is to continue working very hard to give the best to my family members.\r\n\r\nRosenda: I\u2019m 40, married and have two children (20, 15).  I decided to work in knitting to help my husband, who is currently abroad, with the household expenses.  I began to give knitting classes in crochet and with needles, and macram\u00e9, in a stand that I rented.  I used this opportunity to sell the materials that they needed to make the sweaters, ponchos, and other things.  In my free time I was selling shoes to my friends and acquaintances for about a year but I had to stop since the profits weren\u2019t worthwhile.  Currently I\u2019m knitting with a group of women.  The person we\u2019re working for is in charge of exporting what we make.\r\nThe loans that I have gotten are used to buy the materials for making the knit and cotton sweaters, caps, shawls, knit shoes and cotton dresses.  The profits that I get are being used to help my oldest daughter with her career in baking, buying the supplies and paying for the travel, as well as for  basic household expenses.  My goal is to buy a knitting machine because in the future I\u2019d like to set up a space for a workshop in my house, which would allow me to increase my profits.   I need the money to put cement on the walls so that the workshop will look good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":436040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy materials to make typical clothing of the Peruvian mountains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-30T16:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yngrid Jhovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Maria Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ceci Ocelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosenda Evarista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benilda Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inelda Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4300,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375.35,"local_amount":1076,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669112,"comment":null},{"amount":375.35,"local_amount":1076,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1081.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064574,"comment":null},{"amount":374.3,"local_amount":1073,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1078.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899634,"comment":null},{"amount":375,"local_amount":1075,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1080.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T10:44:33Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157353,"name":"Ceferina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia CEFERINA pertenece al banco comunal \u201cAMANECER\u201d. \n\nLa socia, tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, Ella vive en la ciudad Imperial del Cusco.

G. is 30 years old and lives with her husband and two children in the community of Hern\u00e1ndez located in Los Chiles, Alajuela Province. This community is in a mountainous area that has grand vistas and experiences great humidity. It is on the road that is closest to the northern border of the country. The principal economic activities of the region are livestock breeding and agriculture, specifically the cultivation of basic grains, tubers, and oranges.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen has farmland on which she has been growing cassava for approximately the past year.  The cassava is a tuber that is rich in nutrients and has a pleasant flavor.  It is processed for a wide variety of uses and has great demand in Costa Rica as well as from other countries.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen is currently requesting a loan of 668,000 colones to increase her crop yield and prepare her land for planting. She will purchase seeds, fertilizers, and other supplies necessary to ensure optimum conditions for growing cassava.  With this investment, she hopes for a good harvest since cassava continues to sell at a high price.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carmen is a member of the United Community Credit Enterprise for Development, one of the 100 partner organizations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica. This is her first loan and she hopes to grow personally and financially. She would like to offer her thanks to these types of organizations and credit facilitators that enable her to devote more time to productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":435362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase seeds, fertilizers, and other supplies for growing cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-11-28T09:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":668000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":222666.65},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":222666.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":222666.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":50.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172246275,"comment":null},{"amount":399.91,"local_amount":222616.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":222709.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189134100,"comment":null},{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":50.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409181,"comment":null},{"amount":7.76,"local_amount":4318.6,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T08:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4320.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245498527,"comment":null},{"amount":392.15,"local_amount":218297.7,"processed_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":218389.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251651491,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-28T23:04:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157355,"name":"Maria Fabiola","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria\u2019s clothing business continues to do well.

The intent of its ten members is to make progress through their businesses in order to give the members of their households a better quality of life.  They have small businesses like selling footwear, clothes, sweets, purses, and soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nPrimitiva Huam\u00e1n tells us her story.  She had to work when she was 15 because of the lack of economic resources in her home (Huancavelica), which is the poorest department in Per\u00fa.  In my house I maD. the most well known breads like mountain bread.  To do so, I bought the wheat whole and ground it at home.  I baked it in the oven my father maD..  I got up early to travel the streets offering the breads.  I had to be at the stop (the wholesale market in Lima) at 3:00 a.m. to buy vegetables like onion, corn, lemon, and spinach.  All are in packages, which I then distributed to the stores.  The next day I collected payments.  I maD. baskets from reeds.  I sold fruit (apple and prickly pear).  With these jobs I helped my husband support and educate our eight children.  I worked selling many things.  The situation was critical because my husband got sick, and I had to support him even more until he could reestablish himself.  I was selling food.  I stopped that due to the rent increase on the stand.  I bought merchandise like blankets, quilts and pants.  I sold them all and was able to increase the number of orders.  I needed loans to be able to fill the orders.  I used the loans I received to buy merchandise (pots, buckets, cups, bed, jackets, blankets, quilts, and shoes).  Through God\u2019s will I finished educating my children in school.  I improved my reed house with a corrugated metal roof into a house maD. from strong material.  All of this was possible because of the earnings I got from my sales and with help from my children who now work abroad.  My children do not want me to keep working because I am 65.  I receive some form of help from them, but I have decided to keep working as a small businesswoman because I feel like an active and useful person in this society.  My earnings pay my basic household expenses, and I do not depend on the money from my children because I know that they have their own families, which means extra expenses.  I will use the loan I receive to buy women\u2019s underwear, hosiery, and outfits that are in great demand during this Christmas season.\r\n\r\nMy name is Yenifer Gir\u00f3n, and I am 27 years old.  I started as a small businesswoman because I wanted to study for a professional career.  I knew that my family could not afford that because the economic condition of our household would not allow it.  That is why on the week ends I worked as a waitress in the rural clubs.  During this time I saved in order to buy summer sandals (30 pairs).  I got the merchandise at a lower price from my cousin because he manufactures them.  Thanks to God, I sold all of the merchandise to my friends and acquaintances.  I have been working this way for over a year.  The income from these sales, plus the work that I now do cooking in the clubs, allows me to study for a professional career in gastronomy in the Continental (Huancayo) Institute.  I can also pay my household expenses, and I bought a bedroom set.  I need this loan to buy 50 pairs of shoes, sandals, and boots.  Finishing my career is my goal.  I know that it will be hard, but in the end I will be able to finish it and be a professional cook.  I will be doing what I most like to do.  The career that I chose is profitable enough, which will allow me to help my family more.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":436045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy merchandise, shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margarita Mamerta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Natalia Yanett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenifer Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stefhany Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ida Haide ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4600,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669113,"comment":null},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064575,"comment":null},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899635,"comment":null},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1152.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933718,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T23:07:04Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157359,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norma C. es una mujer din\u00e1mica y perseverante, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali, tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es madre de cuatro hijos menores,  tiene una bodega en su casa y cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien es mototaxista.
