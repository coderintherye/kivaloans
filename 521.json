B. is a married woman who lives in the town of Basay, Negros Oriental.  She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a variety store and a food vending businesses.  Her husband Albert, who is 35 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 9 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nLecil joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lecil has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP,  increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stock for the variety store so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Lecil B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).  Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Kawit, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fruit vending business. Her husband Nelson S. also works as a fruit vendor, and helps in Rosalie's business activities. They have five children who are 5 to 19 years old. Two children are working and two children are going to school. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her previous 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to purchase of more fruit.  She wants to continue to save up for future business improvements and family education. Rosalie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

M. is a married woman who lives in Kanipaan, Brgy.Punao, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: raising and selling goldfish and dealing in ready-to-wear\/Avon. Her husband, Norberto, 37 years old, earns his living as a painter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children between the ages of 4 and 15. \r\n\r\n<p>Flordeliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Flordeliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more varieties of goldfish to raise and sell in order to continue to save up for her children's future education. Flordeliza M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Brgy. Pandan, Bogo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her NWFT loans and by her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Lilia is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Lilia hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

Alugbate, Brgy. Gil Montilla , Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: selling vegetables, a tricycle transport and a livestock business. Her husband, Efren, age 48, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 15 to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of  29,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,800 PHP, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Rosalie E. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gil Montilla, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling fish and with a tricycle transport business. Her husband, Willy, age 54, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 14 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,400 PHP, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fish selling business and for maintenance of the tricycle so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lolita E. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

G. is a married woman who lives in Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a Sari-Sari (general) store. Her husband Pancholito G., who is 32 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 7 to 12 years old. Nelfa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelfa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 14,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so she can continue to save up for future improvements and expansion of her business. Nelfa G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

P. is a married woman who lives in  Brgy. Cansalongan, Isabella, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a rice mill and a general store. Her husband Hernani, who is 60 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 28 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nMehujayme joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mehujayme has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the rice mill and to purchase stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs . Mehujayme P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Herminio, who is 44. They have 4 children, but only one, 14 year old Marly, lives with them. The three of them live as a family in their own home, located in the community of Uni\u00f3n Palomar (Central Peruvian jungle). Carmen's beautiful smile shows off her vitality. She has been farming for 8 years. Her main crops are coffee, plantains, and avocado. What she likes the most is being able to take out the quillo (a type of weed that grows between the plantings) that grows constantly. Thus, she ensures that her crops will grow without big problems. The hard work that she does every day for her crops, mainly the plantains, results in her travelling twice a month to the cities of La Merced and Villa Rica, where she sells her products. But since she knows that the harvest for coffee is once a year, she wants to improve and increase the plantings of different products. In this way, she will ensure herself against financial problems. This is the first time that she has had a loan with MFP and she hopes that they can acheive their goals as an independent communal bank.  With the loan she is asking for, she plans on buying various sacks of organic fertilizer. If there is enough money, she will start a coffee nurery with an average of 4 thousand plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":678203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer and make a nursery with 4 thousand coffee plants.

She is 37 years old. Ofelia is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Ofelia T..\r\n\r\nOfelia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Ofelia runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ofelia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ofelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ofelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ofelia is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Ofelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His wife is a trader between two border cities of Russian and Mongolia. \r\n\r\nTogtoh operates a grocery business in his town with help of his oldest daughter. Depending on sales, Togtoh procures food two times a month and in each procurement, he purchases grocery products worth between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT). \r\n\r\nHe has been engaged in this business since 1995 and has built a stable operation. After many years of owning this business, he has not only gained a lot of experience as a businessman but also established a large customer base. His business earnings have enabled him to buy two cars, a garage and an apartment for his family and business. \r\n\r\nFor the future, he plans to expand his business by selling clothing items based on his wife's business. His working capital has decreased due to the devaluation of Russian currency, the ruble. He also wants to purchase a car and therefore he is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan in order to increase his working capital for his grocery trading business.

B. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Sta. Rosa, Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling charcoal, pig fattening and vegetable vending. Her husband, Federico B., who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 9 to 25 years old. \r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans from NWTF helped her earn a monthly profit of 11,500 Philippines pesos (PHP), uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to fund her various business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for the expansion of her pig-fattening business. \r\n\r\nThelma B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Brgy. San Juan, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 8,000 PHP. Nuvy Grace is borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can continue to purchase more stocks of goods to sell. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nuvy Grace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Kanipaan, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15,000 PHP. Marilou is borrowing 23,000 PHP so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marilou  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Poblacion, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: BBQ food vending, coconut wine, and pig fattening. Her husband, Julito C. who is 39 years old, earns a living as a motorcycle driver. They have 3 children who are 7 to 12 years old. All are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nVilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,500 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell so that she can continue to support her family's living expenses and save up for their future security. Vilma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

I. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Camburong, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:  furniture sales, transportation (multicab) and pig fattening. Her husband, Roger I. who is 40 years old, earns his living as a welder\/mechanic. They have 3 children who are 5 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her family's future and to support the expenses of the family. Florita I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a 53-year old widow who supports her family by operating a variety of business ventures: RTW, Okay-okay (used clothes), Buy & Sell Fruits\/Woodcrafts, and pig fattening. She lives in Brgy. Poblacion, Ginatilan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her RTW, Okay-okay, Buy & Sell Fruits\/Woodcrafts and pig fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 15,000 PHP. Valeriana is borrowing 23,000 PHP so that she can purchase new equipment for her business. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Valeriana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

B. is a widow who lives in Brgy. Poblacion, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling scrap materials and sacks and selling soft and hard drinks. She has five children, who range in age from 10 to 31 years. \r\n\r\nFlorida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon helped her earn a monthly income of 33,000 Philippines pesos (PHP), uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future security of her family. Florida B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a married woman who lives in Purok 3, Brgy. Datag, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband, Bonifacio, age 42, works as a carpenter and also helps with his wife's business. They have three children who are 10 to 19 years old. \r\n\r\nMarcia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Marcia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,500 PHP, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stock for her variety store to sell to customers, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marcia M. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

A. is a 43-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store business. She lives in  Brgy. Cansusi, Dalaguete, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 12,000 PHP. Meriam is borrowing 26,000 PHP so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Meriam aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by vegetable farming. Her husband Theodoro, who is 43 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 15 to 25 years old. Marcosa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marcosa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 16,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marcosa C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a 31-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: fish dealer and fishing business. She lives in Brgy. Tapon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She earns an average monthly income of 84,000 PHP. Jensen is now borrowing 45,000 PHP so that she can continue to expand operations of her fish dealership business. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jensen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in  Brgy. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a vegetable-farming business. Her husband, Magno, who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are from 19 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nEugenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eugenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nEugenia C. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Elizabeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more meat and poultry to sell to help her save up for her children's future education. Elizabeth T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to buy feed and vaccines for her pigs so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAilliene N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

S. is from the village of Brgy.

To make a living, Myrna owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Myrna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Myrna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Y do\u00f1a Maura sabe que para que pase eso depende mucho de ella y su esposo. \n","en":"This group is called \"Los Arbolitos\" [\"The Little Trees\"]. The group is from the Tres Estrellas community, in the Municipality of San J. del Rincon. The community has very few resources. There are many fields, and the people work sowing crops and caring for animals. Usually men work as bricklayers, learning the trade from their fathers from generation to generation.\r\nThe group is made up of 8 people; 7 women and 1 man:\r\n1.- Feliciana Jos\u00e9 A., age 37, is requesting the loan for raising sheep.\r\n\r\n2.-Crescencia C. A., 28, is requesting the loan to purchase sheep.\r\n\r\n3.-Magdalena M. S., 37, is requesting the loan to purchase chickens and sheep.\r\n\r\n4.-Damarid L. P., 28, will use the money to invest in her grocery store.\r\n\r\n5.-Maria Catalina S. C., 64, is requesting her loan to purchase animals to raise.\r\n\r\n6.-Maximo M. I., 55, is requesting his loan to purchase calves to raise.\r\n\r\n7.-Leonor M. S., 33, is requesting her loan to purchase fabric to embroider.\r\n\r\n8.-Maura Jos\u00e9 Alvino, 45, is requesting her loan for fabric to embroider.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the members work in agriculture, sowing corn and raising animals to sell. This is how they make their living, along with any income that the women's husbands obtain; in general, they are bricklayers in this community. They are hard-working people, unassuming and humble. In their festivities, their custom is to provide much food. Thus, despite their conditions they are not at all stingy; on the contrary.\r\nMrs. Maura is the group's treasurer. She is 45 and lives with her husband who works in construction. She had 8 children, but unfortunately one has passed away and she only has 7 children. 2 of her children are already married, 2 others work, and the other three, two little boys and one little girl, still depend on Maura. They are in school. Maura has her own home and lives with her husband. In order to support herself economically, Maura sells embroidery that she makes. She needs a lot of material, and so she is requesting a loan to be able to purchase fabric, thread and needles. She knows how to make tablecloths and make sweaters, which are more expensive. It is complicated to sell napkins because the majority of people know how to embroider, and this is an obstacle for Maura. She goes to other areas where the people to not embroider and will buy what she makes. For example, she goes to the center of the municipality, because there are areas where they have lost the custom and there are different types of people who wante napkins or tablecloths to decorate their homes. She hopes to use her earnings to buy some chickens and a lamb to raise and then sell, but she would like to do this without having to borrow money. She also wants to provide her family with the benefit of having her children in school, through buying them uniforms or school supplies. Maura wants a better life, and she doesn't want her children to have the same luck that she had. Thus she wants them to prepare themselves to have better opportunities and a better life. Maura knows that this depends greatly on her and her husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":675732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase embroidering cloth, threads and needles to sell napkins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-27T15:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crescencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damarid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mara Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leonor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":7792.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430765,"comment":null},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7792.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850024,"comment":null},{"amount":946.88,"local_amount":11625,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":11689.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292297,"comment":null},{"amount":315.62,"local_amount":3875,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3896.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-27T20:10:49Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":261325,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201dVIRGEN DEL ROSARIO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito D.

Ese barrio es muy tradicional y famoso por ser el escenario de uno de los mejores desfiles folcl\u00f3ricos que se realizan en la semana del 11 de noviembre, cada a\u00f1o. La microempresaria se dedica a fabricar fritos como empanadas, arepas, deditos de queso y bu\u00f1uelos. El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace 15 a\u00f1os por recomendaci\u00f3n de su mam\u00e1 e impulsada por el hecho de querer generar otros ingresos familiares. Al principio utilizaba s\u00f3lo un caldero peque\u00f1o, pero con el incremento de las ventas debi\u00f3 comprar otros implementos de cocina m\u00e1s grandes. Actualmente emplea a dos mujeres que le colaboran en preparar todos los ingredientes que llevan los fritos. Todos los d\u00edas la se\u00f1ora Martha se levanta a las 3:30 de la ma\u00f1ana para iniciar su jornada laboral, porque debe entregar su producci\u00f3n a 7 tiendas del barrio y una cafeter\u00eda antes de las 8 A.M.  Este es el quinto cr\u00e9dito que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra de una estufa industrial, una nevera e insumos para preparar sus productos.

R. lives in the El Prado neighborhood, in the city of Cartagena, together with her husband and 9 year-old daughter.  This neighborhood is very traditional and famous for being the scene of one of the best folk parades which takes place on November 11th every year.\r\n\r\nThis small businesswoman makes fried goods such as empanadas, 'arepas' (corn fritters), 'deditos de queso' ('little cheese fingers') and doughnuts.  She started her business 15 years ago.  It was her mom who suggested the business and Martha was motivated by the fact that she wanted to make some additional family income.  At first she used only a small pot for preparing her food but as her sales increased she had to buy other, bigger cooking implements.  She currently employs two women who help her to prepare all the ingredients for her fried goods.\r\n\r\nEvery day Martha gets up at 3.30am to start her work day because she must deliver her goods to seven stores in the neighborhood and a cafeteria before 8.00am.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fifth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying an industrial stove, a refrigerator and supplies for preparing her food.

He lives with his wife and his 21 year old son in the San Juan Nepomuceno municipality in the northern department of Bol\u00edvar.  This place is famous for its beautiful handicrafts like hammocks and hats.\r\n\r\nThis small businessman sells pork and mutton.  He buys the animals himself at nearby farms, and he slaughters them.  He learned this job when he was very young because his parents did the same thing.  He sells the most on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.  He has had an established customer base in his neighborhood for many years.\r\n\r\nHe sells between six and eight animals a week.  This gives him a profit of between $150,000 and $200,000 COP.  During the end of the year season sales have increased considerably.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He plans to use the loan to buy pigs and sheep.  In the future, Gabriel plans to arrange a place in order to move his business and offer beef and chicken in addition to pork and mutton.\r\n\r\nDuring some seasons of the year it is difficult to get animals to slaughter because they are scarce and more expensive.  To resolve this inconvenience, he generally buys a greater quantity during the times that they are more abundant.

For 30 years she has made fried food such as arepas [corn bread], pies, fritters, and cheese fingers. The majority of her customers are her neighbours, and some stores. With this business and her husband's help she was able to raise her 10 children. For two years, and thanks to the first loan that the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo gave her, she decided to test her luck with the sale of merchandise such as jeans, shirts, dresses, shoes and crafts. She had complete success because she sold all of her products as she is very popular in her area. She buys her merchandise in cities such as Monteria and Cartagena. She normally requests payment of an initial amount and then full payment in two or three parts. This is her third loan with the Fundacion and she plans to invest it in the purchase of clothing and shoes for men and children. Demand for her products has increased so much that practically all of what she buys is already spoken for. The daily sales of her fried food total approximately $ 40.000 COP and generate her an income of $ 16.000 COP. Her merchandise business generates her an approximate monthly income of $400.000 COP and the turnover of accounts receivable is 45 days. Dona says that she is happy with her two businesses because the food occupies her nights and the merchandise occupies her mornings.

Luz has a son named Jose Antonio, who is 3 years old.  Luz makes a living selling fish, which she has done since she started in this commercial activity more than 3 years ago.  Luz is asking for a loan so that she can purchase more products, which include different types of fish such as mojarra (including tilapia and white mojarra), sea bream, red snapper, sea bass, cuatete, sacamiche, mullet, and scad in addition to shrimp and mussels that are known as \u201ctichindas\u201d.  These fish sell well and Luz sells them fresh, salted, and roasted.  It is worth mentioning that this activity is a bit difficult, since whenever there is a fish shortage it affects those who depend on the products as well as their families.   \r\n\r\nLuz sells her products outside of her community by travelling to other towns.  It is unusual to find fish in the area where Luz lives and sells her products, and that is to Luz\u2019s advantage, and a reason why she has no problem selling her merchandise.  \r\n\r\nWhat Luz wishes for the most is to have her own regular place of business, since then she would not have to walk from one place to another.  She also wants to improve her home, and wants her son to study so that he will be prepared for the future.  Luz sends her greetings to those at the Kiva Foundation who have helped her, and is grateful to everyone on the work team.

La competencia que tiene en el sector es fuerte y por eso se esmera en ofrecer un buen producto, a un precio justo y sobre todo, con una esmerada atenci\u00f3n.","en":"Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez is 43 years old.  He lives in the city of Barranquilla with his wife and five children.  He has a stationary food stall where he sells roasted meat, grilled chicken breast, hot dogs, sausages, burgers and trays of French fries with sausages.  He has had his business for 13 years and it is located just outside the Metrocentro shopping mall, one block from the Metropolitano soccer stadium, the biggest in Colombia.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Antonio starts selling his food at 4.00pm and his work day continues until after midnight.  His best days for sales are Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, especially when the local soccer team, Junior de Barranquilla, are playing.  This small businessman's wife helps him to prepare his sauces and the ingredients with which he seasons his food.\r\n\r\nThis is Antonio's fifth loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest it in buying ingredients wholesale.  Antonio has always stood out for his punctuality in making his loan repayments.  Before he came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Antonio took personal loans through loan sharks who called at his business daily to collect payment.  The interest rate that he paid was very high and he never had anything left over so he couldn't make any savings.\r\n\r\nAntonio's average daily sales are 70,000 Colombian pesos and his profit margin is 45%.  Although the recent winter season negatively affected his income, this small businessman is optimistic for the future because he already has an existing customer base.

Tiene su puesto de venta en las afueras del centro comercial Metrocentro al  sur de la ciudad. Ya cancel\u00f3 su anterior Credikiva con gran puntualidad gracias al cual logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas, sus utilidades y mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda en lo que se refiere a pisos, pa\u00f1etes y techo. Con el actual pr\u00e9stamo planea comprar cuero, hilos, herrajes y accesorios. En un futuro no muy lejano piensa comprar una moderna m\u00e1quina troqueladora para dejar de pagar por ese servicio y darle un mejor acabado a sus productos. Ya est\u00e1 ahorrando para lograr esa meta.

Jim\u00e9nez makes leather straps, billfolds, purses and handbags in his workshop located in his house in Barranquilla.  His sales location is in the outskirts of the Metrocentro commercial center to the south of the city.  He paid off his previous Kiva loan with excellent punctuality thanks to which he was able to increase his sales and profits, and improve the condition of his home (flooring, plasterwork, and ceiling).  With this current loan he plans to purchase leather, threads, hardware, and accessories.  In the near future he hopes to buy a modern stamping machine so he no longer has to pay for this service, to give his products a better finish.

Before he came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, this small businessman financed his business with personal loans that he had to pay back in daily instalments, paying very high interest rates.  As a result of his own positive experience with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, he has recommended us to several friends who are also salespeople and they have joined too.\r\n\r\nRecently, Carlos received training in accountancy, marketing and debt management.

The members of the group decided to give it this name because it is the name of one of the children of the lady who formed the group.  This lady is also the group's president. \r\n\r\nThis story is about Celina C. X. since she is the group's president.  She is 36 years old and a single mother.  She has four children: 10 year-old Luis \u00c1ngel, 8 year-old Eleazar, 5 year-old Sharito and 2 year-old Alberto.  Three of her children are in school.  Two are in elementary school and her daughter is in the second year of pre-school.  Her youngest is still too young for school.\r\n\r\nCelina owns a grocery store which she has had for more than 7 years.  She says that she decided to set up her business because she wanted a way of getting her children ahead in life and providing them with a better quality of life and a good education.  Her business also allows her to look out for her children and not neglect them.  She will use her loan money to invest in buying more groceries for her store such as: milk, oil, soft drinks, eggs, pasta, rice, sugar, salt, water, toilet paper and soap since these are the products that sell the most.  She uses the profits from her business to get her children ahead in life and improve their quality of life.  She can also now support them 100% with their studies so that they can have a better future.\r\n\r\nShe comments that her business is also benefiting the people in her community since she is the only person to have a grocery store and everybody shops there as it means that they don't have to go to another town to do their shopping which saves them time and money.  Celina's goal is to provide her children with an education so that they can study at university and get into good professions so that they can have a better future.  She also wants to grow her business a lot more.  She is thinking of expanding her premises a bit more so that she can have more stock and a greater variety of products to improve and increase her profits.\r\n\r\nCelina says that all her fellow group members are responsible people who fulfil their obligations and they all really like to work to improve themselves and overcome any difficulties.  Celina thanks FRAC and Kiva on behalf of herself and her family because thanks to them she has been able to change her life and her children's lives since they will now have a better education and quality of life.

P. since she is the group's representative.  She is 27 years old and single.  Her business is making and selling bread and she has been in this business for more than 15 years.  She chose this business because she wanted to find the best way of supporting her parents with their financial expenses and to proviD. them with better financial solvency so that they could improve their quality of life.  It is also a very good source of income since it is her family's business.  This is why she decided to set up in this business.\r\n\r\nElideth will use this loan to continue investing in her bakery, buying more ingredients such as salt, sugar, flour, eggs, butter and yeast so that she can produce more bread and a better variety of bread in her business.

She studies elementary education by correspondence at the Eloy Alfaro University.<br>\r\nShe works as a kindergarten teacher, but she also sells clothing of all kinds, and mostly women\u2019s clothing.

O. is a 53-year-old farmer with four children.

Due to her persistent and hardworking personality, Bermet managed to buy a truck which is now used for transportation. Today, she has two milk cows and one bull calf and plans to enlarge the number of her cattle. \r\n\r\nFor this very reason, Bermet has applied for a loan of 120,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing two milk cows and two bull calves.
