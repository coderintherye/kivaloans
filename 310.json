The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

from Tanzania! This is 29-year-old Flora J. from Tukuyu. She is married and has 3 children, between the ages of 2 and 12. Flora has been running a clothes Business since 2003. Her business is to purchase clothes an a wholesale basis and to sell by retail. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Flora currently earns about 124USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to improve the quality of her business. Flora thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":430614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":430622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":88500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757740,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146834,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":88500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984979,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":88500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015652,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":88499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740658,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":88500.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773772,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T19:27:47Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154854,"name":"Edith","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"K.

The greatest challenge he is faced with is that he does not have the resources to be able to purchase materials for the service that he offers, and this has caused his work to decline, which affects not only his business but also his family, because there is less money for food.  On the other hand, he is also affected by the conditions in which he works, which are not safe enough.  Currently, he is renting the workshop where he works, and his dream is to be able to buy it some day.  He started up this small business thanks to the support that his father provided him.  Previously, he had sold fruit and vegetables in the streets of his municipality.  He has a family of four children and a wife who works and helps him with basic domestic expenses, such as water and electricity, among others.  With this loan, he will purchase the necessary tools to be able to do his job well.

It is located in the neighborhood of San Sebastian in the municipality of Tecpatan in Chiapas, Mexico. The village features coffee producing, corn, cocoa, plantains, oranges and other fruit varieties. They are also involved in the production of breeding cattle.\r\n\r\nIn this group is Mr.s Evanjelina J. J., who is a native of the Tecpatan municipality. She is 34 years of age, lives in a free union with Mr. Juan Ramos Cuba. The lady has a baby of 13 months of age whose name is John Ramos J.. She also has a nephew living with them of 7 years of age, who is currently enrolled in second grade. Evanjelina brought her into her home when she was 4 years old. \r\n\r\nEvanjelina J. J. works at home in the development of crafts such as souvenirs for baptism, weddings, birthdays, among other events. The materials used are blankets, paintings, lace, foam, ribbons, etc. She has been involved in this business for 10 years, allowing her to manage her time properly with household tasks and her baby.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a loan to invest in the purchase of materials to produce handicrafts.\r\n\r\nThe lady tells us that she learned this craft from her aunt, and also took time courses in the capital of Chiapas, Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez. The income of her business is 50% of the investment, which is partly used to purchase equipment.\r\n\r\nShe believes her business is special in that she learned some from her grandmother, as is the case with her typical regional blouses, embroidered by hand. She uses the best material, so that customers feel comfortable when the item is worn.\r\n\r\nShe feels great satisfaction when she sells her products because she is proud when she receives payment as she is contributing to household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has managed to analyze the biggest factor affecting her business -- location, which is on the edge of town.\r\n  \r\nHer aspiration is to grow her business later, where she can create employment for other women like her who can overcome their challenges. In addition, she intends to use the loan to buy machines to facilitate the work, improve her establishment and thus increase her sales. \r\n\r\nThus, she can further support her child for what is necessary to carry out her studies, and also for her nephew who is already part directly to his family. She wants to then be able to offer courses in crafts, so as to share her knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe five other women listed below also have their own business with the exception of Olga Lidia G. L., who will begin the sale of shoes, which is her greatest aspiration. Patricia J. D., has an establishment selling cosmetics and clothing. Silvia J. J., sells shoes through catalogs. Rosa Maria L. E. and her husband every go down to the river to fish very early, and then Mrs. Rosa Maria takes the fish and sells it in the market. Erika Estrella M.

Ms. Basilisa A., who had participated in the program for Female Entrepreneurship before. She contacted her local entrepreneurship and microfinance counselor, and discussed continuing her work with Fundacion Paraguaya. She gathered 15 women, all of whom work comfortably together today and support each other in solidarity with their shared goals.  \nThe group's members use their loans to invest in their individual activities, such as selling food, haberdashery, goods, herbs, garlic, cleaning products, mandioca (cassava), cushions, fruits, etc. \nA particularly inspirational woman in this committee is Do\u00f1a Felicita Pavon. Her story exemplifies the hard work that women in Paraguay put into their businesses and how female entrepreneurship makes a big difference in their lives and the lives of their families. Do\u00f1a Felicita Pavon sells groceries to help her husband with family expenses. She has three children, all of school-age. Her husband has temporary jobs, but no stable, fixed employment or salary. \nDo\u00f1a Felicita bakes small pies, makes sandwiches, patties and pastries to sell to her neighbors and workers who live and work in her community. Do\u00f1a Felicita finds it very difficult to sustain and grow a business when she has such a high turn over rate - which is why the loan she receives from the Fundacion is so helpful. She can continually invest more into her business and let it grow and increase her profits. She also finds the help she receives from the Fundacion in terms of training and preparation, very helpful. The challenges faced by a poor family are very unique and need special attention. \nAll committee members help each other to reach their common goals to better their livelihoods and achieve prosperity - the same goals as the Fundacion Paraguaya. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":430732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pabla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evergista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":6900000,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":431250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154918,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erlinda G\u00f3mez es una mujer carism\u00e1tica y emprendedora, vive en el distrito D. calleria regi\u00f3n D.

She is a dairy farmer and sells the milk to an enterprise that produces all kinds of dairy products.  Her husband, asiD. from helping with the milk production, also farms and produces most of the feed, like chala (corn husks and cobs), alfalfa and corn, needed for the dairy cows.  Eustaquia lives in the Machac Marca area of Cochabamba.  This is an area that is quite far from the city so for them to go to banks in search of financing is very difficult.  This is why Cidre took the initiative to go to this area and we discovered that the conditions in which they have their cattle are not very good; most lack stable facilities which in this rainy season is very much needed.  Therefore, Eustaquia will use these funds to build a stable so that her cows won't suffer during the rainy season.  Eustaquia tells us that her greatest wish is to continue with milk production like she's done to date, to see her children and grandchildren have a better future, and to someday have enough cattle to leave her children an inheritance that will help them in life, which every day is more difficult in the nation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

This group was formed thanks to Ms. Dolores Hawk, who approached a local counselor to find out about the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurs Program. She became very excited and very anxious to work with this program and is now very happy working in her fifth Group loan cycle.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe average credit  given to the committee is Gs.639.000 per member. The members of this group use their allocated credit for different activities such as purchasing fruits and vegetables, ingredients for food preparation, dry goods, goods for the pantry (sugar, rice, grass, bakery, dairy, meat , etc.), supplies for jobs in manicure and pedicure, hair accessories, etc. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is a very active group, with all members demonstrating solidarity and fellowship and attending weekly meetings and fundraising activities conducted for the common good of the group. It is one of the best groups working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya and Kiva, as all the members have remained together since the beginning."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":430750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333

For the last two years she has sold cured meats {chorizo (cured pork sausage, flavoured with paprika), sausages, ham for sandwiches, among other varieties} and dairy products (yoghurt and cheese) which she takes to the various areas of the city to sell, both for cash and credit, to her customers.  In addition, her house has six rooms which she has rented for the last year; she does this to help her husband defray household expenses.  What she likes most about her job is to get to know various places and people.  Besides, it's profitable because she has a list of regular customers who always place orders with her.

of Cuenca.  Cuenca is the capital of the Azuay province and is renowned for its beautiful architecture, its beautiful temples, the four rivers that bathe the city, and the able hands of its craftspeople as well as for its warm and kindhearted inhabitants.  Patricia lives in the Totoracocha community, is married and has three children, 22, 20, and 18 years of age.  Her first two are students at the Instituto Sudamericano and her youngest daughter studies at the Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Tapia Institute.  Her husband is a mechanic and together they watch after the wellbeing of their home.  She still does not have a home of her own; she lives with her in-laws.  Patricia prepares meals that she home delivers.  Besides, she owns a small grocery store in her mother's house in the community of Lim\u00f3n, which is in the eastern part of Ecuador.  She travels there on weekends to see how the store is doing and to stock it with merchandise.  She has done this for 7 years.  She tells us that five years ago she was a member of the bank but had to leave for personal reasons.  However, now she is back and very happy because soon she will receive the requested loan with which she will buy kitchen equipment and pots that she needs to set up her restaurant.<br

Mar\u00eda Silvia is a hard-working, tenacious woman who decided to set up her own business selling carbonated beverages in a well-equipped environment.  She herself administers her business, without a boss or a set schedule.  She tells us that she started out with 400 soles and bought three cases of soft-drinks.  She noted that she did very well but didn't have enough stock.  In time, bit by bit, she invested more.  Currently, she continues with the same business and she is well-known by her customers who are the same workers and persons who come to take care of paperwork at city hall.  With this 1,000 sol loan she will buy more soft-drinks in various flavors, sizes and brands as well as mineral water, both sparkling and still.

All of her life she's been a farmer, principally growing potatoes, which she takes to the urban areas of her location to sell.  With her savings she was able to acquire two vehicles that are used for passenger transport.  For the last year her husband has driven one of them and they hired a driver for the second vehicle; both cover an interprovincial route.  This earns for them income in addition to what they get from farming which is enough to meet household needs.  In transport, one works every day and there is no specific day off, unless one of the vehicles might need some type of maintenance.  This work has allowed them to meet household expenses and even have some savings.  For this reason, she wants to acquire yet another vehicle.  This is her ninth loan with MFP and she is very happy to be part of a communal bank because it is a good experience on top of the savings system they have.  This time the requested funds will be used to buy sacks of natural fertilizer and potato seed for her next planting cycle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":430852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy natural fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T23:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2524.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933768,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T04:44:41Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154957,"name":"Willy Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Willy tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive junto a su madre y cinco hermanos en la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace cinco a\u00f1os trabaja como pintor de veh\u00edculos, el nos comenta que un amigo fue el que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 esta actividad y desde entonces trabaja eventualmente pintando buses y autos.

What he earns he uses for his personal expensses and to help with family expenses.  Two years ago, using all his savings, he acquired a mototaxi (three-wheeled, motorized vehicle, used to transport passengers and cargo) with which he earns his keep when he isn't painting vehicles.  He hasn't paid off this vehicle yet so he is requesting financing from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 new soles to pay it off and do some service maintenance that it needs due to its time in use.  His dream is to be able to buy another mototaxi so that he can continue to help support his family.  He is an optimistic, steady and hard-working young man.

For the last 32 years he has been a farmer.  Every day he goes out to inspect and care for his plantings.  His wife is his main collaborator.  His main crops are:  potato, wheat, barley, and quinoa (a main food staple of the Inca civilization, who held the crop to be sacred, quinoa has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years).  However, he also raises farm animals (sheep).  His main income is generated by his grains so every chance he gets he increases the size of his crops.  This can be exhausting work, both for him and his family, but it is compensated for by the profits that allow him to cover costs.  Besides, he always has food for his own consumption and this is a very big advantage for his family.  This is his fourth loan with MFP and he is very happy to be part of a communal bank.  The funding requested will be used to buy sacks of natural fertilizer and medicine for his animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He lives with his wife and the youngest of his children, his 7-year-old son, in the Las Pampas settlement, Olmos district, which is an hour and fifty minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  For the past 8 years he has raised sheep at home which he then sells to buyers who come by the area.  This is his only source of income so Victor gives the best of himself to care for his animals.  Every day Victor takes his sheep to pasture from very early in the morning.  However, the grasses in the area do not provide the required nutrients for his sheep to be well-nourished.  This is why he has called upon Edpyme Alternativa, for the first time, to ask for a loan of 1000 new soles to buy nutritionally balanced feed for his sheep.  His greatest wish is to be able to provide his son with the means to study a profession that will assure his future.  Victor is a responsible father, very devoted to his family and to his work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

His parents separated 10 years ago; his mother lives in Argentina and his father lives in the city of Huaraz.  Jorge had started to study business administration in an institute in Chiclayo but, due to lack of funds, had to abandon his studies a year and a half ago.  With is grandmother's help he was able to buy a second-hand mototaxi with which he is earning his livelihood.  He works from very early in the morning until well into evening.  This is his only source of income which he uses to defray personal expenses and to help support the family.  Because of the heavy usage and the age of the vehicle, it has begun to have mechanical difficulties but Jorge lacks the funds to make repairs.  For this reason, he has called upon Edpyme Alternativa for his first, 1000 new sol loan, which he will use to service and repair his vehicle.  Jorge wants to finish his studies and set up a vehicle repair shop so that he can continue to get ahead in life and support his loved ones.

It is located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that her husband works occasionally as a bricklayer, and what he receives is not sufficient to cover the family expenses, she decided two years ago to open a convenience store in her house.  The store supports her family economically.  She tells us that she previously had a small convenience store, but she fell ill and had to close it.\r\n\r\nNow her business is growing again, and she has started to sell vegetables, fruits, basic needs items, and groceries.  Teodolina is planning on expanding her business, but she does not have sufficient capital to do so.  That is why she has seen the need to ask Edpyme Atlernativa, for the first time, for a loan for 1,000 PEN.  She plans to invest it in order to reach her objective.\r\n\r\nShe plans on continuing to expand her business and renovating her house with the earnings she receives.  Teolinda is a fighter, and she always tries to get ahead in spite of difficulties.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She completed her secondary school education but has been unable to attend any university courses for economic reasons.  Two years ago she restarted the business her parents had before the earthquake.  In the disaster, her parents lost their house and almost all the merchandise that they had.  Since then, they have devoted themselves to  the sale of candy and grocery items. \r\n\r\nKatherine began the new business with her own savings that she earned from working in the fields at an Agro Exportadora (\"Exporter of Agriculture\").  She sells her merchandise at home and offers her customers warm service and good prices.  She serves her customers in the mornings and her mom helps her during the afternoons.

Mercedes lives with her mother who helps her take care of her daughter.  Mercedes began her business one year ago and sells all kinds of disposable plastic containers in the city of Ica's market.  She started this business with her personal savings.  Mercedes offers good service and prices to the customers that come to her market stall.  As a consequence, her clientele has slowly increased.  She wishes to equip her business for the Christmas season so she can fulfill a greater number of customer orders, but she doesn't have the finances to cover the cost of all of the extra merchandise.  For this reason, she is asking for a loan so she can buy more merchandise.  Mercedes works every day with the primary goal of providing her young daughter with her basic living needs so that she doesn't feel the absence of her father and enjoy the comforts that her mother's business brings her like offering a good education.

Asa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. She used her previous loan to buy farm supplies and equipment. Asa is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST to buy farm supplies and equipment. This will be Asa's second loan from SPBD. Asa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her village, Talusan, is part of Bulanon, a barangay of Sagay City. She is 31 years old and married to Jerry, a 37-year-old fisherman. They have four children; the oldest is eleven, and Juvy just gave birth to her youngest child a month ago. Their two older children are already attending school, and Juvy hopes that she and her husband will be able to afford to send all of their children through school and on to college so they will have better opportunities in their adult life. In pursuit of this dream, Juvy has helped her husband in his fishing venture. They wake up very early in the morning so that they can reach the market ahead of others and get a good price for their catch. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital for their fishing business. With the help of successive loans she has been able to purchase additional fishing gear, thus enabling them to catch more fish. With the help of one of her loans, she was able to purchase another fishing boat, adding to their income capacity. She now nets an average monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, which she is happy to note is quite enough for their young family for the time being. But she is determined to continue to strive hard to save up for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nShe previously borrowed 19,500 PHP, which she used as working capital for her fishing business. She paid the loan's weekly installments without delay throughout the loan\u2019s term. Now in this eleventh loan cycle she is borrowing 19,500 PHP so that she can both repair their existing fishing boat and buy a new one. \r\n<p>\r\nJuvy is shown in the photograph above with her boat.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is engaged in a retail business, selling different flavors of ice cream on sticks in his village using his motorcycle. He hopes that he could further expand his business by having more items to sell. He dreams of selling his products in different villages, if only he could gain additional capital for his business. He hopes that his first loan of 5,000 Philippine pesos will be granted for the growth of his ice-cream business.\r\n\r\nJovencio is a 50-year-old businessman.

S. is a 55 -year-old woman.  She lives in the town of Sataoa C.  She has 11 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Tauala owns & operates a business venture.  The business operates in the agriculture sector.  The main purpose of the business is raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for S..  Tauala has been engaged in this business for over 6 years.  From these activities, Tauala earns approximately 500 WST a month.\n\nIn 2006, Tauala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.   Taula had a previous loan loan from SPBD which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST.  The current loan will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tauala plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

and her husband are engaged in manufacturing an improvised stove. It is being assembled by her husband. Gloria helps him in delivering their product to different villages and to some dealers. For each stove, they earn PHP700. Gloria would like to further expand her business to make her business more profitable. She hopes to obtain a loan of PHP5,000 to use as additional capital in purchasing more materials needed to manufacture more stoves. According to her, the more capital they have, the more stoves they can make.

is only 21 years old. She lives together with her family in the village of Punit, Benito Soliven, Isabela. Imelda is married to Leo who is designated as a Counselor in their village. They are blessed with a daughter who is now four years old. The couple dreams of a good future for their child. They hope to send her to college and have her finish her courses someday. \r\n\r\nImelda wants to help her husband provide for the needs of their child.

He currently resides with his wife and five children in Bayan-Olgii province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. All five children go to local secondary schools. Bayar and his wife have a small meat retail business. Bayar visits herder families in Bulgan soum, a small town 300 km away, and purchases sheep and cattle. He sells them at a local food market for profit and the sheep and cattle that he is able to sell at the market are slaughtered and sold in small pieces at his wife's stall.  The collaboration of Bayar and his wife lowers the risk of the sheep and cattle not being sold. The couple has been in the meat retail business together since 2004 and been doing very well. Bayar says that as the business expands, he and his wife would like to open saving accounts for his five children, in order to secure their future well-being. Bayar requests a loan to purchase more sheep and cattle for his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

He lives with his wife and daughter in Bayan-Olgii province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. Bahitbek drove his small van in the town for passenger service until 2008, and then decided to hire his brother as a driver for his van, in order to pursue another business in the meantime. His wife works as a conductor in the passenger van, and Bahitbek now runs another small business in order to expand his business horizon.  Fall is usually the season for families to stockpile their winter food, especially meat which is the most important and significant ingredient for a Mongolian family's diet in the winter. As the demand for mutton and beef significantly increases seasonally, he purchases livestock from herders in the countryside and sells the meat in smaller quantities in town to buyers. He says that he is working hard to make his business sustainable and profitable, in order to best support his family.\r\nHe requests a loan to purchase mutton and beef from herders.

When spring arrives, he will be selling the well-kept beef and mutton at the higher price in order to make a significant profit.

O. is 35-years-old and the father of four children. He resides in Bayan-Olgii province, one of Mongolia's western provinces, with his children and wife. Three of his four children are secondary school students; the fourth is a 1-month-old baby, for whom Serjan's wife stays home to care. \r\n\r\nSerjan has been engaged in small businesses since 2005. He started with a clothing retail business and subsequently switched to a fuel retail business in 2008. He purchases fuel from fuel-trucks that pass through his town to carry fuel from Russia to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He purchases the fuel at a lower price and then sells it to local car owners at a lower price than local fuel stations. Since he offers a better rate than local fuel stations, he receives fuel orders from his customers in advance. Additionally, he repairs broken cars and sells them at profit and runs a small chicken farm at home. His wife takes care of the chicken farm and sells the eggs in local stores. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan so that he can purchase some feed for his chicken farm and have more capital with which to purchase fuel for his customers' orders.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia; additionally, it has mainstream commercial operations.

your work well and the blessings will be yours.\u201d That's an inspiring quotation shared by Genoveva D. of Barangay Paniki, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. After her college education, she married Federico D. and they are blessed with three children. They want all of their children to be successful in their chosen professions so that they will be employed someday.<p>\r\nThe major source of their income is through farming. They till their parcel of land twice a year. They plant rice, corn and some vegetables.

Shaiym lives in a rural town. Together with her husband, she has raised four children. Her husband is engaged in trading at the market. As for the children, the elder sons, who are 34 and 29, make their living by working as taxi drivers. A daughter, 26, is a seamstress. The youngest son, 22, is a welder. \r\n\r\nAbout 10 years ago, Shaiym got an idea to start raising cattle. She consulted with her husband and children and they decided to give this idea a try and purchased some sheep and a cow. After a short period of time, they understood that this was an excellent business as it was profitable and economical. Since that time, Shaiym has received a lot of profit as she has been selling milk daily and selling sheep when needed. \r\n\r\nHaving these children, Shaiym is already a happy mother and could easily spare herself from any kind of concerns or problems. However, she has been the one who has brought these children up to be hardworking young people. Now Shaiym is 56 years old. She is actively occupied with increasing the total population of her cattle and sells 15 liters of milk per day. This brings her around $105 per month. Moreover, all her children strive to help their mother after work to take care of cattle. Shaiym does not have any difficulties dealing with her livestock. Shaiym needs a loan to buy one more cow. \r\n\r\nShaiym\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nAsel, 22, is married. Her husband is a welder. Asel raises livestock and sells milk. She needs this loan to buy two or three sheep.\r\n\r\nAigul, 40, has three children. Her husband works at a construction site. Aigul tailors woolen shoes and sells them at a fair. Aigul hopes to buy some sheep with this loan.\r\n\r\nRapat, 30, is the wife of a taxi driver. Rapat works as a seamstress. She has applied for this loan to buy one calf. \r\n\r\nShaiym and her partners have some savings to add to the loans to be able to make their purchases.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious, socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \n\n\nAbout GDMPC:\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":431200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets to raise and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Plaridel, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.6078 123.6894","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T03:40:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemarilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":115.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3535.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110688749,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ramazon is a married man with five children. His children are the reason that he tries so hard to provide them with a stable family life and an education for their future. For the past two years Ramazon has sold rice. This is a profitable business in his neighborhood, and his sales have increased considerably year after year. His start-up capital was from the severance pay he received from where he used to work. \r\n\r\nTo expand his business, Ramazon is requesting a loan of $3000, which he intends to use for increasing the size of his inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These three children are still in school and help him with his store.\r\n\r\nNazrullo has thirteen years experience with his business selling groceries. With his small savings and on his own initiative, he decided to set up the store nine years ago. He thought about it because there wasn\u2019t this type of business in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThanks to the store, Nazrullo was able to buy a small used car which he uses to do deliveries in the mornings from time to time. His wife doesn\u2019t work and when Nazrullo needs to go out she is in charge of selling the groceries. Nazrullo works everyday of the week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This hardworking father is motivated by his great love for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time Nazrullo has requested a loan from IMON International and he has proven to be responsible with his repayments in the past. He wants to use the loan to invest in his store. He is sincerely grateful for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will help improve the quality of life of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is a teacher in a local school. Considering the low wages teachers earn, Nasiba started her own business of processing and selling apricots nine years ago. Dried fruit, especially dried apricots, are very popular in Tajikistan and are good for one\u2019s health as well. Considering the constant demand for these dried fruits, Nasiba\u2019s apricot business is quite successful and has resulted in a significant and stable income benefitting her household and the education of her dear children. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Nasiba  is requesting a loan of $1500 USD. She is going to use the loan to purchase more apricots with the purpose of expanding the range of apricot products she sells. Nasiba expresses her gratitude to everyone who supports her. Help this woman of much strength and courage to keep working. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture and new Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is not married, but the need for an additional source of income for his large family forced him to start his own business. Burkhon has about two years of experience in the public transportation field. Demands for his service are rather high since there are so many people who need it. \r\n<p>\r\nBurkhon must maintain his vehicle since this is the tool of his trade. So now Burkhon is counting on your help. He is requesting a loan of $3000 USD to purchase spare parts and winter tires for his microbus. With your support, Burkhon will continue to prosper in his business and so support his brother and sister in their education. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture and new Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Because of the financial strain, she and her siblings never finished high school. This was really hard for Miriam because her whole life she had dreamed of becoming a primary school teacher. She loves working with children and she has a lot of patience around children. She loves her own children so much \u2013 they are her reason for working. Miriam and her husband work hard to make sure that their children have a good education and will be able to finish high school and attend university.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Miriam will purchase construction materials to build a stable for her livestock. Miriam hopes that this loan will help her to increase her milk production and protect her cows from illness, as they currently do not have a place to stay dry when it rains.

They recently formed so that they could get a loan. The 7 women and one man who make up the group's board help meetings run smoothly. The president, Teodora Q., the treasurer Genoveva L. and the secretary and minute-taker, Juan A. say they formed the group because they needed working capital to improve their income. They all work in different economic activities such as carpentry, blanket weaving, selling chicken, clothes, hats, detergent, and sewing aprons.

For over 15 years she has had a dining room and a hostel, which is located in the central neighborhood in the city of Bluefields.\r\n\r\nIn her business she has several rooms, which are primarily used by the inhabitants of other communities who come to this city for business or for personal reasons.  They stay in this hostel because of its location, which is by the municipal dock.  That makes it easy to get on a boat to be able to return to the community they are from.\r\n\r\nShe offers three meals a day, taking advantage of the fact that the lodgers do not have family in this city and require this service.  Nevertheless, the rooms in her hostel need security.  They are made of wood, and in the last few months she has been repairing them little by little.  Her earnings do not allow her to make a large investment.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason that she is asking for a loan to buy part of the material she needs to remodel the rooms and guarantee better service for her customers.\r\n\r\nShe needs to buy:  10 bags of cement at $10 US per bag, 60 units of blocks at $1 US for each one, 2 meters of sand at $24 US per meter, 3 \u201cquintales\u201d (100 pounds) of metal bars at $80 US per quintal, 2 meters of black gravel at $75 US per meter, and 2 pounds of wire at $1 US per pound.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish,

She is currently hoping for her fourth loan as she has made great progress since she first joined.  She is hoping for a loan in order to expand the number of items she sells through her food stand.  She would like to add flour, seeds, palm oil, bananas, and cocoyams to the items she currently sells.  Tanjong considers her business will succeed because she has always experienced strong sales through her food stand.  She expects the expansion of products available at her location will strengthen her offering as well as strengthen her relationship with her customers.<P>\r\n\r\nTanjong is an enthusiastic individual who, despite severe hardships, has managed to maintain a positive outlook on life.  Tanjong\u2019s most difficult loss was the recent passing of her husband.  She felt a deep pain at the loss of her spouse and leaned on her friends and family during her difficult time of mourning.  She considers the best manner by which she can contribute to her community is to provide healthy food as well as the option of a nice room in her house for a reasonable rent.      <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":431485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":66925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757745,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66925.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146839,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984984,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":66925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015657,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":66925.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740663,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":66924.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773777,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T22:41:11Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":155334,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie is married with six children.
