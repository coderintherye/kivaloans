She tells us she learned this business from her mother who had a similar business many years ago. They pick the fruit from the dry forests of the region, and then process it and sell it to many businesses around the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nNataly has received an order from the city of Lima, but she does not have enough carob fruit to fulfill it. On the other hand, the fruit from the forests has run out so she has to buy it from the fruit pickers, who sell 30-35 Kg. bags. This is why Nataly is requesting her first loan of PEN 700 from Kiva partner, Edpyme Alternativa - so she can buy the carob fruit to produce more algarrobina.\r\n\r\nNataly is a well known and beloved young woman among the neighbors of the region, who consider her a hardworking woman and mother.

But in today\u2019s world, by being part of a committee of entrepreneurial women, there is an attitude of feeling of their belonging, and of being able to fulfill the requirements demanded by the foundation.  Thus they can continue receiving capital to satisfy the needs of their small businesses so that they will generate more income.\r\n\r\nThese women are grateful to the foundation for  giving them a valuable opportunity and every day they hope to have more experience in the program to fulfill their obligations as members.\r\nEach one does her work with a lot of determination and satisfaction since, as the women tell us, these businesses help them support their households.

They are workers that are looking every moment for a way to progress. With their daily efforts they hope to achieve a better future for their children. The members live in the San Isidro de Chicon Community near the city of Urubamba, in the department of Cusco. This area is known for its beautiful countryside, its agriculture and its ranches. The city of San Isidro de Chicon is located ten minutes from the city of Urubamba.\r\nFrancisca is a member of the LOS DINAMICOS DE SAN ISIDRO DE CHICON Community Bank. She is 42 years old, is married and has two children (Elvis and Ofelia) that still depend on her for support. Francisca raises small animals such as guinea pigs, pigs and ducks. She is an enterprising woman. Since she has obtained her permit from the city to raise animals she has begun this business. This woman has been a member of the Community Bank for the past year. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy more guinea pigs and for animal food.\r\nThe other members also raise young animals or they sell groceries, work in agriculture, sell dry goods or build houses. Raul works as a driver in the city.\r\nThe members are worried because sales are down because their buyers work directly in the tourist industry. The heavy rains that fell for three days in the city of Cusco caused tourists to cancel their reservations for trips to Cusco. Tourism has fallen quite a bit.\r\nThe members are thankful for the opportunity that is available and promise to pay their individual payments on time. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":488961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-15T23:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Fabiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inoscencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Cancio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melquiades","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencio Raul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":13500,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2035.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2116.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2201.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2289.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2381.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2476.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":716.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":744.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":774.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":805.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":837.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":871.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":716.19,"local_amount":2035.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905971,"comment":null},{"amount":744.85,"local_amount":2116.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633441,"comment":null},{"amount":774.64,"local_amount":2201.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2209.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667863,"comment":null},{"amount":805.64,"local_amount":2289.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2297.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851525,"comment":null},{"amount":837.84,"local_amount":2381.22,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589884,"comment":null},{"amount":870.84,"local_amount":2475.02,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2483.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-17T01:00:15Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176173,"name":"Sandra Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sandra M\u00e9ndez tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad es casada tiene 2 hijas una de 18 y la otra de 21, ellas ya terminaron sus estudios y veven con su familia.\nLa comunidad en la que vive es muy tranquila es urbana y esta ubicada en San Miguel Petapa. \nSu sue\u00f1o es poder modificar su casa y alquilar dos locales para poder generar m\u00e1s ingresos.\nDo\u00f1a Sandra vende mercader\u00eda mexicana, abarrotes, cubrecamas y edredones.

She worked as a street vendor starting first in her city, Carapegua.  She then began to travel with her mother to another city, Lambar\u00e9, and she now has customers in both cities with many orders.  Thus she needs to have more capital.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan from our agency to buy articles of clothing.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

The group members live in Sarapiqui, Heredia, a rural region close to the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The group members will use this loan for general investments in productive activities such as the rearing and selling of chickens and the purchase and sale of colognes and perfumes.\r\n\r\nChristina A. V. is the president of this group. She is always busy and engages in many economically productive activities such as curtain sewing, nail painting, selling retail products and poultry. This loan will be used for the purchase of chicks as well as feed for the rearing and sale of her poultry.\r\n\r\nChristina aspires to open a store one day where she can offer a range of services and products to her clients. She says her only obstacle is financial and that she works with her husband as a team: when Christina needs to work, her husband watches their daughter and vice versa (he is a taxi driver and farmer).\r\n\r\nDinia Gisselle G. G. is a 33-year-old mother who lives with her family in Sarapiqui. She has a business selling men\u2019s and women\u2019s colognes and perfumes in her community. She started her business with an initial investment of 100,000 colons. Her husband\u00b4s work requires him to travel to Panama roughly every fifteen days. In Panama the prices for quality perfume and cologne products is much less than in Sarapiqui. For example, a name brand perfume that sells for 12,000 colons in Panama sells for 22,000 colons in Sarapiqui.\r\n\r\nDinia has been selling perfumes and colognes for five years. She spends her days traveling to homes and restaurants in Sarapiqui, offering products to potential clients. She collects orders from her clients which she passes on to her husband who makes the necessary purchases when he arrives in Panama. Dinia says her business is growing; she wants to expand operations as the income she earns contributes significantly to her family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\nDinia knows that she faces much competition in her community; there are many women selling similar products. As a result, she strives to provide superior service to her clients by bringing them all the products they request.\r\n\r\nSometimes, Dinia\u2019s clients have trouble paying for an item in full. In these cases Dinia organizes flexible payment schedules to suit the needs of her client. She hopes to one day open a store where she could sell not only perfumes and colognes, but clothing and cosmetics as well.\r\n\r\nDinia hopes that \u201cThe Womens Bank to Build the Future\u201d will expand and acquire more members from the

Two days a week she travels door to door, offering potential clients the opportunity to peruse a catalogue filled with a variety of products from car parts to underwear. After collecting orders, she goes to a distributor meeting for her specific catalogue company and purchases the items. Upon delivery, she is paid for her services.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used by Alis to finance the purchase of catalogue items for resale. She says her kitchen products are the most popular. She would like to expand her business and find more clients. She has been involved in this business for about a year.\r\n\r\nM. is a 22-year-old mother. She is involved in the same activity as her sister, Alis, only with a different catalogue company. M. will use this loan for the purchase of products to sell in her community and to finance travel expenses. A difference between M.\u2019s business and that of her sister is that M. must travel to San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, in order to purchase her products, about a two-hour journey each way by bus.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":488984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To finance the purchase of catalogue items for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Sarapiqui, Heredia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-02-15T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31971.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32504.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33046.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33597},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34156.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34723.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":31971.63,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32671.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949193,"comment":null},{"amount":60.94,"local_amount":32504.49,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":33215.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678093,"comment":null},{"amount":61.96,"local_amount":33046.23,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":33769.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712567,"comment":null},{"amount":63,"local_amount":33597,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":34331.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047927,"comment":null},{"amount":64.04,"local_amount":34157.04,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":34904.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763240,"comment":null},{"amount":65.11,"local_amount":34723.61,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35483.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-16T06:15:15Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176180,"name":"Miurel Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miurel Karina de 21 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera, habita en casa de sus padres junto a sus hermanas, labora en el Hospital Asuncion desde hace 2 a\u00f1os como despachadora de farmacia.

This loan will be used for general investments necessary to the growth of the members\u2019 poultry businesses. Specifically, this loan will be used for the purchase of livestock and feed.\r\n\r\nJuana Jes\u00fas C. L. is the treasurer of this group and is a 50-year-old mother of two. She has completed high school and some technical courses.\r\n\r\nJuana is in the business of rearing and selling chickens and their eggs. She started her business with an initial investment of 100,000 colons. She focuses her energy on bringing her clients a high quality poultry product coupled with exceptional service because she knows this is what they value. Juana would like to secure more customers and keep the loyalty of her existing ones. She expects her group to display sincerity and responsibility as central values.\r\n\r\nJuana has recently purchased two piglets. She intends to use this loan to purchase livestock and to maintain the good health of all her animals by ensuring regular weight and protecting them from parasites. She says the best way to accomplish this is by giving the animals proper vitamins and plenty of water.\r\n\r\nCarmen D. B. is a 37-year-old mother of three. Her highest level of formal education attained is the completion of primary school.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a business rearing and selling chickens which she sells from door to door in her community.

She says she \u00a8likes to stay busy, no time to rest.\u00a8 She hopes to use this loan to increase her earnings and improve her standard of living.\r\n\r\nA main obstacle for Carmen is transportation. The area in which she lives is very rural. It is one of the only regions in Costa Rica without electricity or running water. Buses do not pass by her house and the road leading to her door is too muddy for cars to drive on.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":488997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more livestock and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Sarapiqui, Heredia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-02-16T00:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30387.9},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30894.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31409.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31932.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32464.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33006.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33556.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34115.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":34684.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35262.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35849.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":36437.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.96},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.22},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.98,"local_amount":30387.9,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31052.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949194,"comment":null},{"amount":57.92,"local_amount":30894.37,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31570.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678094,"comment":null},{"amount":59.28,"local_amount":31616.31,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":32307.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712568,"comment":null},{"amount":23.35,"local_amount":12453.41,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12725.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258665,"comment":null},{"amount":552.47,"local_amount":294648.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":301093.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551316,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-16T03:58:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176184,"name":"Claudia Guissel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el departamento de Chinandega, espec\u00edficamente en el mercado El Bisne, la se\u00f1ora Claudia T. se dedica con gran esfuerzo a su actividad de venta de alimentos siendo preparados por ella misma con el fin de ofertarlos para as\u00ed obtener sus ingresos para el mantenimiento de su hogar.\nElla est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de materia prima como lo es el aceite, arroz, frijoles, pl\u00e1tanos, entre otros.

They both live with their two children, Herman (age 27) and Luis (age 26), in their own home which they inherited from her in-laws.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she began making pastries, Edis used her earnings to meet the family\u2019s expenses, pay for the food they consumed on a daily basis, and cover her children\u2019s education.  For this reason, she took great care in performing her work.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past three years, Edis has been making empanadas (pastries filled with meat) and selling them to different soda fountains and restaurants.  She also decorates cakes and desserts for ceremonies and special events.  What she enjoys most about her job is preparing her empanadas and selling them with great joy.  She believes she generates more sales when she has a smile on her face.  On the other hand, the thing she hates most is having to chop onions.  Laughingly she says, \u201cit is part of the job, but I would rather not do it.\u201d  Edis always looks to progress in her business, so she plans to open a food stand so that she can sell her products without having to walk great distances.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Edis knows the lending methodology very well and enjoys sharing her experiences with the other members of the Communal Bank.  With her loan of 1000 soles, she plans to buy all the ingredients and supplies needed to prepare pastries and snacks in larger quantities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

He is 53 years old and lives in his own home with his lifelong companion, his wife Lucia who is 54.  Unfortunately, this happy couple was not able to have children.  \r\n<p>\r\nJuan\u2019s farmland is located five kilometers outside of the city, where he plants potatoes with the help of his wife.  At the same they raise cattle, which they sell live or as meat.  Of all his agricultural activities, Juan enjoys taking care of the cattle the most because he likes watching them indulge themselves in his pastures full of grass.  Juan remembers that he was not any good at farming when he got married.  Over time, after he bought a house, developed his farm, and started raising animals, he got to the point where he could start living comfortably.  After gaining a few years of experience, he decided he wanted to plant more crops and acquire more animals.\r\n<p>\r\nJuan is receiving his fourth loan from MFP and, as always, promises to make his payments on time because he believes his word is more important than the documents involved.

He will fatten and sell them for a profit, along with his crops.

The hamlet is located in mountainous terrain and is very close to the northern border of Costa Rica.  The area\u2019s principal economic activities are farming and agriculture of which staple grains, sugar cane, and oranges constitute the main crops.  Eight months ago, Freddy secured a job at a pineapple plantation.  However, the plantation is located at some considerable distance from his home and Freddy finds it difficult to get to work due to the poor state of local roads and public transportation.  Due to the time spent travelling to and from work, Freddy has been unable to tend to the allotment he owns.  Therefore, Freddy has decided to buy a moped to solve his transportation problems and to save on money and time.  He is asking for a loan of \u00a2654 (six hundred and fifty four Costa Rican Colons) to buy the moped and, thus, equip him with his own form of transport.  Freddy forms part of the Community Lending facility Emcrecoba, one of 100 affiliated organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is his first loan and Freddy expresses thanks for the opportunity to focus on productive activities that such organisations and loan facilitators provide him.           \r\n<br

S. is a young woman of 22 years.  She lives with her small son in the hamlet of Ca\u00f1o Negro situated in the canton of Los Chiles in Alajuela province.  The hamlet is located in mountainous terrain and is very near the northern border of Costa Rica.  Farming and agriculture are the area\u2019s main economic activities, with staple grains, sugar cane and oranges as the principal crops.  Recently, Elizabeth managed to secure a job in a hotel, but reports that getting to and from work is difficult as a result of the hotel being of considerable distance from her house, local roads being in poor condition, and few public buses.  To solve the issue of transport and to be able to save on time and money, Elizabeth has decided to buy a moped.  Therefore, she needs a loan of \u00a2654 (six hundred and fifty four Costa Rican Colons) to buy the moped and to provide her own means of transport.  Elizabeth is part of the Communal Credit lending company Emcrecoba, one of the 100 organisations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is Elizabeth\u2019s first loan.  Elizabeth expresses thanks to these types of organisations and credit facilitators, as they make it possible for her to focus on more productive activities.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

R., 31, lives with her husband and their four children in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro.  It is located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province.  This area is in a mountainous region near the northern border of the country. The main economic activities are livestock breeding and agriculture, specifically the planting and harvesting of basic grains, sugar cane, and oranges.\n\nKarla has worked in a hotel for a little over two months.  She says that she now has a source of income, which helps her husband with the household expenses.  But, she says, her work is pretty far from her house.  It is difficult for her to get there because there is very little public transportation and her schedule rotates.  Sometimes she needs to wait a long time to find transportation. \n\nTherefore, Karla has decided to buy a motorcycle to be better able to get places.  That way she will speed up the way she travels, and she will be able to save and take advantage of having more time.  To do this she needs a loan for \u00a2654,000 (six hundred fifty four thousand colones) to buy the motorcycle.  That way she will be able to have her own vehicle, which will allow her to get ahead and facilitate her form of travel.\n\nKarla is part of the Emcrecoba Communal Finance Institution, one the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her second loan, and with the loan she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  She also plans on actively participating in the loan organization in her community.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 44 years old. Nida is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNida is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Nida owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nida joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nida from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":487952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

M. is from the village of Balide, Aurora Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 42 years old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Editha owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as snack food, sugar, biscuits, salt, shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc. Editha has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Editha joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Editha has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Editha is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Editha from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

C. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan de oro City. She is 35 years old. Bevelyn is single and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Bevelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Bevelyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bevelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bevelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Bevelyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Bevelyn from HSPFI.  Bevelyn chose to have the same amount until its 5th cycle.

The inspiration of maintaining her excellent performance in ASHI since the time of her membership is drawn from the four most significant blessing she received from GOD. These are her four children whose age ranges are from 10 to 20 years old.  Despite of poverty and small family income, Ana and her family give love and respect to each other. While her husband manages and working in their small business which is a vehicle (particularly motorcycle) repair shop, at home Ana does the household chores and is taking care of their children. \r\n\r\nAs her children grew old their family expenses also increases hence, Ana and her husband wanted to enhance their small business through a loan for a capital. Because Ana and her husband are just poor, no one in their village would trust them for a loan. With that, Ana joined ASHI and had found the answer to her problem. Since then, she made her business grow anyhow but not yet to the extent of achieving her dream of making it sustainable. Ana and her husband still want to buy more equipments and machines necessary for the business to improve their efficiency, to improve the quality of service they can give and be able to have more costumers. Therefore she still asks for a much larger amount of loan for its fulfillment. Proceeds of her business will be a great source of finances for Ana to be able to sustain the education of her children until they graduate from college. And by then, their lives will be different and they can have a better and well compensated kind of job.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":489196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"Will be used to purchase necessary equipments such as welding machine and others.

Her husband, who manages the vehicle, wants to replace some of its parts to improve its quality. \r\n\r\nDespite Marlyn\u2019s financial insufficiency and because of her hard work, she hopes that by growing her business and increasing her profits, she will be able to lift her family up from poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":489238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Therefore, she is looking for a larger amount of financial assistance, via a loan, in order to sustain and grow her business.

Sokha C., 40, has been married to Mr. Chanthorn since 1991, and they live in the Muk Kampoul District of Koh Dach, a famous island located 30 kilometers along the Mekong River roughly 15 kilometers

She has been managing her own variety store and computer shop for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nRosalinda has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her variety store and computer shop.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Rosalinda would like to obtain a PHP 46,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her variety store and for buying equipment and accessories for her computer shop.\r\n\r\nRosalinda dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can have a good and comfortable life with her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":489368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

Beatrice lives in Gakenke, a region of Ruhengeli situated in the Northern Province of Rwanda. There, Beatrice is the president of a group called Witinyagukora.  This group has been in this business of selling tomatoes and vegetables for a long time and the hours of their business are from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m every day.\n\nBeatrice as the president of this group, is requesting a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company in order to expand their business through purchasing some additional goods for sale.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her plant business.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business. She will use the loan funds to buy raw materials needed to produce her wares.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can have a good and comfortable life with her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Her early marriage and motherhood pushed her capabilities in running a small business. She had no other way to change her life, as well as her two children\u2019s lives, as she depended on her husband\u2019s small income as a motorcycle technician. She is not even a graduate of college (because she came from a poor family) to be employed in offices or have a better paying job. Because of that, Maricel opened her eyes to see more options for having her own income; hence, she thought of her skill in cooking food. She thought that maybe, selling food as her business would provide her an income which she could use to augment her husband\u2019s. \r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of ASHI, the loan she received was used to start her envisioned business. She gained a lot of customers from the neighborhood and even from other villages. After six months, she had fully repaid her loan and had improved their life a little. Her second loan, with a much larger amount, enhanced further her business; however, to fully achieve her dream of having a restaurant, she needs more loans. Therefore, after just recently paying off her second loan, Maricel is again requesting a loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos. This will be used for the same purpose. Some of the proceeds of her business will be spent for obtaining her family\u2019s basic needs, while some will be saved for her two children, whose ages are 2 and

Loans she requested and received were used for a fishing business in partnership with her husband. Eventually it went well and her proceeds were used to finance the education of her three children, whereby the 28 year old eldest child is now a teacher and the other two are in college. However, Remedios wants to buy their own motor fishing boat instead of buying fish from others in their village. Even though this activity will be pursued, Remedios wants it to grow, therefore, she is requesting a much larger amount of loan through the ASHI and KIVA partnership. This loan is very significant for her because the graduation of her two children from college relies on her business profit.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which began soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and its lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the financial services they need.

Khudoidod is married and has seven children. He has always been a hard-working man who has made sure, from a young age, that his family never goes without their daily bread.\r\n\r\nKhudoidod has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs. With a starting capital of $100 USD, thanks to his perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise four years ago. Over time he expanded his business and today this business has become domestic as his children and wife are also engaged in it.\r\n\r\nToday Khudoidod needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase the range of his selling goods. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of 1,250 USD. He is ready to work even harder, to make sacrifices, and to push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nWe believe Khudoidod\u2019s perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has a one year old daughter, who her mother helps care for.  Her husband works as a collector for the Caf\u00e9 Soluble plant.  She works as a teller in a bank.  She has been doing this for one year, but her salary is low.  She also works with the new businesses in the capital city on the weekends, where she can earn a little extra, but this limits the time she is able to spend with her family.  She also gets off of work very late and she is often afraid when traveling home, because of the crime along her route.\r\n\r\nHer plans are to move into another position that will provide better income, which will allow her to complete the improvements to her small home, which she and her husband have managed to build.  She requested this loan because she needs to complete her bathroom and she doesn\u2019t have the money for the labor.  This is why she reached out to Afodenic, who is providing the opportunity to make these improvements.  \u201cI am happy to be able to complete the bathroom in order to have better privacy and a more hygienic home.\u201d  She has already purchased building materials, such as stone, sand, cement, iron, and flooring to begin the work. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo R., Kiva

Aparquilla. They live in Aparquilla Anta, Cusco, and meet once a month at the community center in Aparquilla. Each group member works in retail. Cirila and Juana sell vegetables. Melchora, Julia and Ysabel deal sell small animals. Herminia sells groceries, and Fermin sells animal feed. Marina sells grain.\r\n\r\nThe group is concerned that their sales will be affected by a bridge to Izcuchaca that gave way during recent floods. For a while, they couldn't sell their products in other cities in Cusco. They got creative, though, and sold more products by finding an alternate route to the city of Cusco itself. \r\n\r\nOne group member is Cirila, a 62-year-old married woman with children. Although she doesn't have much formal education, she was able to open a small business buying and selling vegetables. She will use her portion of this loan to buy seeds. Flooding has damaged a number of farms belonging to group members, including Cirila's. They've lost their crops and need to repair rain damage. The group really appreciates this opportunity, and pledge to repay their loan on time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":489790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying seeds to replace lost crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Anta - Anta - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T03:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melchora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Raimundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gumercindo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yony","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8200,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1236.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1285.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1337.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1390.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1446.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1504.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502.65},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":522.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":429.72,"local_amount":1236.39,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905974,"comment":null},{"amount":446.92,"local_amount":1285.88,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1286.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633445,"comment":null},{"amount":464.8,"local_amount":1337.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1338.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667867,"comment":null},{"amount":483.38,"local_amount":1390.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1391.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851529,"comment":null},{"amount":502.7,"local_amount":1446.37,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589886,"comment":null},{"amount":522.48,"local_amount":1503.26,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800706,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-17T12:40:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":176640,"name":"La Amistad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" El contacto para el inicio del presente comit\u00e9 fue la se\u00f1ora Sebastiana Rojas quien invito y organizo a sus amigas para formar parte del programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras.\n\nLa sra.

They are worried because they aren't able to sell their products due to the heavy rains that lasted for several days.  The rains raised the water level of the river, which moved the bridge over which they cross from the community of Izcuchaca into the city of Cusco; therefore, there is no way across.
