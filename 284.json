is hard to imagine how a woman can be pregnant every other year - twelve times so far - plus take care of all of the children, be a good housewife and mother, and still have enough energy to run a business sewing clothes for other people, but that's what Purita G. has been doing most of her life. She is married to Manuelito G., and they live in the village of Purok 2, Carabalan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, where Manuelito also farms the small agricultural land that they own.\r\n<p>\r\nThey married very young. Their oldest child is now 39 years-old, and with a new addition to the family almost every two years, Purita figured that the income her husband earned in farming was just not going to be enough, especially as there is always the danger of the crop failing because of bad weather, pests and other unexpected conditions that could affect production. Knowing that she could earn an income by making use of her dressmaking skills, Purita decided to start this venture using a small amount of capital from their family funds.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her dressmaking business became popular, she needed additional capital so that she could service her customers faster, but, because they were poor, she knew that no-one would lend her the much-needed capital. When a friend told her that she could borrow funds from NWTF-Project Dungganon without providing any property as collateral, that she only needed to attend a short seminar to learn how Grameen-method microlending could work for her and four other members of a group, she asked her husband's permission and joined in 2000.\r\n<p>\r\nArmed with her loan, she was able to improve her dressmaking business.When she paid off her loan on time, she was able to borrow a bigger loan in the next cycle due to her good credit record. This has made a big impact in her family's lives, allowing her to help pay for their household expenses and even set aside a small amount for the future. Aside from dressmaking, Purita also began selling different household goods during market day in Barangay Carabalan, where she lives. Since market day is only once-a-week, she sells the goods from home the rest of the week. She also sells coconut wine in her community. After all business expenses, Purita earns an average net profit of PHP 3,000 per month from her business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nShe continues to strive hard and look for other business opportunities so that she could provide her children with a better life. She knows that she still has a long way to go, as her youngest is just 10 years-old, but she is happy that the older children are now gainfully employed and only four are still in school. She knows that with great perseverance, steadfast industry, and faith, she will surely achieve all the she aspires for her children and herself.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her twenty-second cycle loan she borrowed PHP 18,000 as additional capital for her business and for the farm. She maintained her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon, fully paying the loan on time without any delays. For her twenty-third cycle she plans to borrow PHP 20,000 for her business, and intends to use some of the income for house repair and improvements.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":396716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Additional Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-03T09:12:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":173.08,"local_amount":7692,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":8122.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004173,"comment":null},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":6154,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6498.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848944,"comment":null},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":6154,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6498.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739612,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T12:54:52Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141726,"name":"Gilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gilda M. is from the village of Poblacion 1 , Clarin,Misamis Occidental.

They live in the village of Bulubitoon, Brgy. Miranda, Hinigaran, in Negros Occidental with their three children, who range in age from six to twelve years-old. Jeremy's mission in life is to help her husband raise their three children well, and provide them with a good future through education. In the short term, she plans to earn enough income to defray their small family's household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHer aspirations for her family became more attainable when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the microcredit loans it offers using the Grameen methodology. She used the first loan as capital to set up her own general store. She was very happy when she saw that even with just a small amount of capital and its small returns, she was able to help provide for her family and set aside some savings for future security. She was able to increase her next loan amount by paying back each weekly installment on time, and paying off the loan within the set term. As a result, she was able to expand her business and started a food vending business. She knows that she is well on her way to attaining her dreams, as each new loan has also increased her monthly income. At present, she earns an average income of PHP 8,000 per month from her business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her previous ninth loan cycle, she borrowed PHP 16,000, which she used as additional capital in her business. She maintained her good track record by paying each installment on time, and paying back the full amount within the set loan term. Jeremy plans to borrow PHP 17,000 for her tenth loan cycle to buy stocks for her business, such as the very in-demand firecrackers and fireworks, in preparation for the coming holiday season.\r\n<p>\r\nJeremy is shown in the attached picture with her 2 sons.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Carabalan Road, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, is a 64-year-old widow and mother of 12 children, seven of whom already have their own families, while five  of the younger children still live at home. As a widow for sometime now, she is used to feeding such a large family and has gained her community's respect because of the way she has raised her children to have integrity and moral fiber. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen Melita was widowed, she had to rely on the income from her general store. To augment her only source of income, Melita decided to make use of her cooking skills and expanded her business to include food vending, and this additional venture enabled her to support her children. But as her capital became insufficient to generate the income to cover the family's needs, Melita decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon after she heard from some of her friends about how it could help her. After getting her children's agreement, she joined NWTF-PD in 1990.<p>\r\n\r\nThe loans from NWTF-PD enabled her to expand the operations of her general store and food vending business. Using her dressmaking skills, she also started making ready-to-wear dresses to sell to her neighbors, and the cumulative income allowed her to support the education of her children. Three of her children have helped out in the family expenses since they graduated from school and began earning their own income. Her business now nets her an average profit of PHP 2,000 per month. <p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan she borrowed Php 11,000 which she used as additional capital for the general store and food-vending business. The loan was fully repaid on time.  She plans to use her 16th cycle loan amounting to PHP 11,000 to purchase additional items for her RTW business and the general store. The income from these will be used for her food-vending business.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women.

T. is a 67 years-year-old woman living in the town of Lepale.  She is married and has 3 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Luisa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Luisa has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately $450 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Luisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Luisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Luisa is now requesting a new loan of $1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Luisa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 56-year-old woman living in the town of Savalalo.  She is married and has 6 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Mariana owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Mariana has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\n\nMariana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mariana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Mariana is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mariana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Sina has been engaged in this business for over four and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nSina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  Sina is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST, which also will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by Sina from SPBD.  Sina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Taufusi S.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Iuvale owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Iuvale has been engaged in this business for over 1 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Iuvale joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Iuvale is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Iuvale is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Iuvale plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is a 65 years-year-old woman living in the town of Salamumu Tai.  She is married and has 6 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Pelesa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Pelesa has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately $450 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Pelesa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Pelesa has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1550 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Pelesa is now requesting a new loan of $2300 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Pelesa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is a 70 years-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitele-K Fou.  She is widowed and has 7 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Katarina owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a bakery.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from baking & selling a variety of baked goods in the local community.  Katarina has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately $350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Katarina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Katarina has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase baking equipment.  Katarina is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Katarina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has 6 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Akenese owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling soft drinks in the local community.  Akenese has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately $520 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Akenese joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Akenese has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  Akenese is now requesting a new loan of $2000 WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Akenese plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 55 year-old woman living in the town of Sinamoga.  She is married and has 5 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Ana owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fried foods in the local community.  Ana has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately $750 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Ana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ana has successfully repaid a previous loan of $750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Ana is now requesting a new loan of $750 WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is a 48 year-old woman living in the town of Leualesi Leauvaa.  She is married and has 7 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Temukisa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Temukisa has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately $550 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2003, Temukisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Temukisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of $2750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase land to raise additional crops.  Temukisa is now requesting a new loan of $2950 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Temukisa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Janice has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately $850 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Janice joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Janice has successfully repaid a previous loan of $2000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Janice is now requesting a new loan of $2000 WST which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Janice plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":178409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

P. is a 44-year-old woman living in the town of Alafua.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Leti owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Leti has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 550 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Leti joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Leti has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Leti is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Leti plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Mafi owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Mafi has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Mafi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mafi is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Mafi is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mafi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to make improvements to the borrower's house.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

owns a computer and copier service business and runs it in a rented office in a busy trading center. He is 31-years-old and lives with his wife in an apartment in the Chingeltei district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He started his business in 2008 and his monthly earnings are between 600,000 and 700,000 tugrugs (~ $420 - $490 US). While he has been successful in his business so far, he has found it expensive to purchase necessary equipment and products in Ulaanbaatar. This is why Shihihutag has decided to import his supplies and equipment directly from China. He has received loans in the past from XacBank, the leading bank in Mongolia, and has always paid back his lenders on time. Shihihutag is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug (~ $700 US) loan so that he can begin to import computer and copier equipment from China, in order to cut down on his overhead and increase his profit

Ana is now requesting a new loan of $1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

F. is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Tiavea.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Filiga owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Filiga has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Filiga joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Filiga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Filiga is now requesting a new loan of 2700 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Filiga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

I. is a 28-year-old woman living in the town of Tiavea.  She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Eseta owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Eseta has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eseta is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Eseta is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Eseta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S. is a 32 year-old woman living in the town of Magiagi.  She is married and has 4 children school-aged children.  To make a living, Asomaliu owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Asomaliu has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately $355 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Asomaliu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Asomaliu has successfully repaid a previous loan of $750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Asomaliu is now requesting a new loan of $1150 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Asomaliu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Leusoalii.  Avatea is married, and she has one school-aged child.  To make a living, Avatea owns and operates a business in the agriculture sector raising crops.  Her main source of business income comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas, and selling them in the community.  Avatea has been involved in her business for over six years, and she earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n\r\nAvatea joined SPBD in 2009 to access financial services and engage in business activities, which will help improve her living situation.  Avatea successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD, which was used to purchase seeds, seedlings, and young crops.  Avatea is requesting a new loan of 1750 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure.  This will be Avatea's second loan from SPBD, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is a 63-year-old woman living in the town of Vaimea.  She is married and has 10 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Isa owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Isa has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 650 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIsa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Isa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads.  Isa is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Isa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

N., age 33, lives in a medium wooden house where she braids silk skirt for sale.

Thaiy N. has been a silk weaver for 19 years, a skill she learned from her grandmother. She sells her finished product to a middleman, who then takes it to re sell at the market in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. She has also been hired by the villagers to spin silk where she can earn extra income. Recently, a part of the raw material has been ran out from stock supply; Thaiy N. wants to resupply and is requesting a loan from HKL to purchase more silk to continue weaving.

She and her husband used to live in Naryn, the most mountainous part of Kyrgyzstan, where most of the population is engaged in raising livestock. \r\n\r\nAigul was not an exception. It was in Naryn where they started raising cattle, and after moving to Chui Oblast, they purchased new cattle and resumed their familiar activity. However, after a while a big ordeal awaited Aigul when her husband passed away.  The burden of supporting the whole family, consisting of herself and three children lay solely on her shoulders. Aigul did not give up and instead, kept struggling. Since then, the children have grown up a great deal. Her eldest son is 19 years old.  He has become a tremendous help to Aigul since he started working at a construction site.  Next is Aigul\u2019s 18\u2013year-old daughter. She is pursuing her education at Kyrgyz State University. The youngest is Aigul\u2019s second daughter, who is 13 years old.  \r\n\r\nAigul milks the cows every day and earns her living by selling milk and yoghurt. For 20 years this activity has been the main source of her income. Selling milk brings her around $65 a month. Aigul needs a loan to buy one more cow to sell more milk products. She has started to think about money for her son's wedding.\r\n\r\nAigul\u2019s partners are Svetlana, Kuljan and Elena. Svetlana, 56, is divorced and has two sons, both of whom live separately. Svetlana has quite an unusual way of making a living. She braids armchairs and rocking chairs from willow. She needs a loan to purchase raw materials to manufacture her products. \r\n\r\nKuljan, 53, is a mother of six children. She is occupied with selling milk, yoghurt and sour cream. She needs a loan for harvesting her four hectare piece of land, and with the rest of the loan she wants to buy a calf. \r\n\r\nElena, 44, has four children. For a living she sells milk, eggs and nuts. Her monthly income from selling these items is around $226. Elena needs a loan to purchase slag stone to build a shed.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is 42 years old and divorced. However, her determination and strong character help her to live on. Anarkan lives with her daughter, who is 28 years old and married. Her daughter works as seamstress. An amiable personality and love for children characterize Anarkan, who works as an officer teacher in a boarding school. After getting married, Anarkan and her husband sold their old car and purchased cattle and some sheep. Since then, Anarkan has been keeping cows and sheep and has been selling milk. Now she manages to sell up to 20 liters of milk in one day. \r\n\r\nWorking in a boarding school is quite tiring. The whole day is spent dealing with youngsters who would wear out anybody, but it is not the case with Anarkan. She finds in herself endless energy to come home after work and care for the cattle as if she just woke up in the morning. This enterprise of raising cattle together with her formal occupation brings her $300 a month. This, in turn, is enough incentive for her to keep going. Anarkan has applied for the loan as she wants to purchase a milk cow to be able to sell more milk. She is resolute about the necessity to increase her total population of livestock and about buying her daughter a flat in the same city. \r\n\r\nAnarkan\u2019s partners are Natalya, Anna and Oliya. Natalya, 51, is divorced. She has only one daughter, who works as a seamstress.  Natalya  works as an educator in a boarding school and also sells milk. Natalya needs a loan to plant her two and a half hectare land with winter wheat. \r\n\r\nAnna, 53, is a widow. She has one daughter. Both Anna and her daughter are teachers at a boarding school. They also sell milk, yoghurt and sour cream to locals.  Anna needs a loan to purchase three tons of coal for winter. \r\n\r\nOliya, 46, is divorced. She has one daughter, who works as an accountant. Oliya sells milk and works part time as a school teacher.

She is 50 years old and has raised three children. Her eldest son works at a police station. Her middle daughter is married and her younger daughter is a college student. Nurbubu and her husband are, by their nature, very active people. Therefore, Nurbubu prefers a noisy and busy daily routine to the quietness of being at home. They sell foodstuffs in a small shop. \r\n\r\nAccording to them, it is always possible to set up a business.  In the beginning, Nurbubu did not have a container or a building to use when she wanted to start selling. So she and her husband made a small space right inside their house for their shop.  Long ago, Nurbubu already had experience selling dishes in a big market. This was an incentive for her to open a shop at home after her marriage. Investing just $45 in this undertaking, Nurbubu now earns three times as much on a monthly basis. This very same shop has given Nurbubu an opportunity to educate her children and build a new house. Now Nurbubu hopes that by using this loan she will be able to purchase more goods to enrich the assortment and increase the turnover.  Nurbubu plans to complete the building of their new house, see their son married and build a shed for keeping cattle.  \r\n\r\nNurbubu\u2019s partners are Nazgul, Kanitat and Ramis.  Nazgul, 31, has three children, all of whom are school students. Her husband works as a policeman. Nazgul is engaged in raising cattle and selling milk. Nazgul needs a loan to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nKanitat, 47, is a mother of three children. She is occupied with animal husbandry, selling milk and also needlework. Kanitat needs this loan to cover expenses related to harvesting wheat. \r\n\r\nRamis, 18, is single. Despite his young age, he and his brother, 17, already take care of his family, which consists of his mother and a five-year-old sister.  Ramis raises cattle and sells milk.  He needs this loan to plant wheat and purchase fuel.  He has decided to try farming and if everything goes well, become a farmer.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her husband produces sun-dried bricks, whereas Begaiym sells milk - nine liters per day. She needs a loan to buy a calf. Selling milk brings her $63 a month.

At the age of 26 Shirly is already a business minded, always aiming high for the improvement of their business because she wants to help her husband in giving their child a better future. Her husband is now working as an agent in selling land. This is one of the sources of their income but it does not enough for the expenses in the house especially for the studies of their child. So Shirly pursue her business which is the making of Tinapa. Tinapa is a processed fish, usually made in fish that only found in the Philippines like bangus, tamban and galunggong. According to Shirly, in making a tinapa you will boil all the fish in a big bowl together with their ingredients, and then after boiling cook again in a big container.

Shirly only hoping what is the best for her family so she will never be tire of doing all the right way to improve their

She used the loan to buy assorted goods, such as thread, candles, sponges, and other household necessities to display in the local marketplace during the town's market day.

Before she joined, Teodora already had a small vegetable farm, but she kept it for their family's consumption only. When some of her neighbors started inquiring about buying some of the vegetables that her family could not consume, Teodora got the idea that it would be a good income source if she increased her production and sold vegetables in the local market. As the volume of production grew, she started building good customer relations and soon had many regular customers, some of whom bought vegetables in bulk. Teodora also raised pigs in her backyard as a supplementary source of income. All these ventures were made possible because she is able to access loans for capital from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and the relationship prospers because Teodora always pays her weekly installments on time and fully pays her loan within its loan term.\r\n\r\nBecause her vegetable farm can for now sustain itself, Teodora plans to expand her pig fattening business. She is planning to borrow PHP 25,000 for her 8th cycle loan for this specific purpose.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

L., who lives in the village of Buenavista Sibong, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental, is 40 years old, married, and the mother of two daughters who are 8 and 12 years old.  Emelda dreams of securing the future of her family and lifting them out of poverty by giving her daughters an education, sending them to earn college degrees when they grow up. She is very optimistic that she will achieve this goal because her daughters excel in school - both earning first honors in the past year. <p>\r\n\r\nAt first, only her husband was engaged in selling \u201cBalut\u201d around their community, neighboring villages and the nearby towns, but even with his best efforts, his income could not provide for everything that the family needs. Since \"Balut\" is such a popular Filipino snack, Emelda knew that if she helped her husband and sold \"Balut\" in other places, she'd would earn an income, and this is what she did. When she was able to save enough, she put up a small general store adjacent to her house, but she also continued with her \"Balut\" vending.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen she needed fresh capital to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005. She reciprocates the support provided by NWTF-PD by paying back her weekly installments on time and paying the loan in full within the set loan term. Emelda has continuously maintained her good credit standing, and the loans she takes help her increase her income potential. Her present average monthly income is PHP 9,000, which enables her to save for her daughters' future education.<p>\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, her twelfth, she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for her \u201cBalut\u201d business. Now that she has fully repaid that loan within its term, she plans to take another loan of PHP 13,000 for her 13th cycle loan which she plans to use to purchase additional inventory and working capital for her business. She intends to use the income from this loan to continue supporting the household expenses and the education of her daughters.<p>\r\n\r\nEmelda is shown in the picture posing inside her general store with some of the \"balut\" eggs.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a mere $1 a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Q.\u2019s source of income for the family is their tricycle (motorcycle with a sidecar), managed by her husband. The said tricycle was already old and used before it was given to her as her inheritance. Nevertheless, this has provided well in her life, especially for Juvean\u2019s four children whose age range is from seven to 13 years old. Since this is the main means of transportation of people in their municipality and within their village, the income it generates can at least provide them with food for the day. <p>\r\nJuvean joined ASHI last month in September because she wanted to sustain their tricycle. She is requesting a loan through ASHI which will be used to renew their tricycle license and to continue its operation. Someday, she hopes that she will be able to request a much bigger loan amount which will enable her to buy a new tricycle for better presentation, which will attract passengers\u2019 interest. The profits she will be making in this business will be the means for her to be able to send all of her children to school until graduation in college. By then, their standard of living will have changed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":400734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Her two children are still studying and are already in the college level.\r\n\r\nWith her desire to send her children to college and finish their studies, she is doing her best to send them to school. She wants to borrow PHP 22,000 that will serve as additional business capital for her store. Some of the things that she will purchase are canned goods and other basic commodities needed at home. She believes that, with the support of Kiva lenders, nothing is impossible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":400732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Her husband, Mr. Maen Run, is a fisherman who now faces a small problem because he does not have enough money to buy fishnets so Mrs. Koem Seang M. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets for her husband business. Mrs. Koem Seang M. is 39 years old and the mother of four children one of whom is employed in a garment factory while others two are attending the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of six years old. \n\nOne member in this village loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans so this person is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Aside from maintaining an excellent performance in repayment, business and attendance in ASHI, she has also maintained her attendance to the needs of her children at home and in school. Despite many challenges in her life, she never gave up fighting against poverty. Her dressmaking and tailoring business has grown and requires more capital to sustain her business. She became the producer of uniforms for one of the biggest colleges in the municipality. At the same time, the expenses have increased for her two children in college, one in high school and for her adopted child. Because of this, Mercedita requests a bigger loan through ASHI so that she can support the growth of her business and be able to meet the growing demands of her customers. Without capital Mercedita\u2019s business will not grow and she will not be able to help her children graduate from college or help the people in her village that she employs as dressmakers.  At times, her children and her husband, who is a fisherman, help her in minor processes of

Sokhom Touch Group Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokhom T. is the leader of a four member group in Pou Khvet village in Takeo province. She is a Khmer cake maker. Her husband, Mr. Heng Soeun, is a farmer and cultivates rice on a piece of land he owns. The couple also acts as a rice middle-man. Since their business is doing well, they want to expand it by purchasing more rice to re-sell to earn more income. Thus, Mrs. Sokhom T. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She is 49 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom are enrolled in the local school, while the youngest is too young to work or study. Mr. Heng Soeun came to request the loan, so he is presented in the picture instead of Mrs. Sokhom T.. \r\n\r\nOnly one member in this group has an end-of-term loan, while the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor, as they allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":400919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more rice to re-sell to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokhom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sochea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arnn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2800000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266700},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.59,"local_amount":533400,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":536852.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103738863,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626444,"comment":null},{"amount":64.3,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118023201,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":266700,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":268426.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123861880,"comment":null},{"amount":76.35,"local_amount":316700,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":318750.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128894659,"comment":null},{"amount":64.37,"local_amount":267000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T07:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":268728.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137011771,"comment":null},{"amount":88.3,"local_amount":366300,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":368671.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151839103,"comment":null},{"amount":124.51,"local_amount":516500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":519843.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151841036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T11:29:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142129,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a cow, ten pigs, and pig food for breeding.

Nuon P. is a villager in Sdol villager in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice to earn for living. Her husband, Mr. Phin Rann, is a taxi driver. This couple also owns a business by using the rice to make wine to sell. Although this couple tries to work hard, they still earn less income to support the family living.

But making salt is not as easy as it seems. Yes, all you need to do is leave sea water under the intense heat of the sun, wait until all the water evaporates, and then all you need to do is gather and pack the crystal residue into sacks and haul it off to the market to sell. It may sound like such a laid-back job but when you factor in what havoc even just a little rain could do to the end-product, then it wouldn't sound so easy anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is the business of Cecil C., a 52-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Tabao Baybay, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Jose, helps her with her business. They have four adult children: the oldest, who is 30 years old, already has a family; the two middle children are gainfully employed and help with the family expenses; while the youngest, who has also finished college, is still looking for a job.\r\n\r\nCecil and her husband, Jose, have been in the salt business for over fifteen years, and they have persevered in spite of the many problems they have encountered along the way. They pushed on, traveling from town to town to sell their product, even when it just earned enough to pay for the basic household expenses with some left over for the education of their four children. But when their children were nearing college age, Cecil knew that if she did not increase her income, it would certainly not be enough to send the children to get their higher education. This was her motivation in joining NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000. The additional capital provided by each loan enabled them to increase their income and afford the college education of their children. \r\n\r\nCecil now earns PHP 9,000 average monthly income for all her efforts, and is a big help to the family. The last time she borrowed from NWTF-Project Dungganon, her loan was PHP 12,000, and she used it as additional capital and it earned a good income. She paid each installment on time and fully paid the loan within its term. Now for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 that she intends to use as working capital for her salt-making business.\r\n\r\nIn the attached picture, Cecil and Jose pose in front of a few sacks of salt they are readying to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":400704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

F. is a hardworking mother who dreams to improve the quality of life of her family by providing them with the necessary tools to become independent and self-supporting when they grow up. She is a 54-year-old woman who lives in the village of Barangay Maytubig, Isabela, Negros Occidental, with her seven children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was widowed in 2004, Phoebe was almost devastated as she was left to support the five who were still living at home. Even with the help of one of her older children, who was already gainfully employed, life was hard for the family, especially as all of the younger kids were still in school: one in college studying criminology to get qualified for a law enforcement job, and the rest were still in high school.\r\n\r\nPhoebe thought long and hard about ways to earn more for her family. She knew that she needed to get more capital to increase her income, and this is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 so that she could add more stock to her general store and therefore increase her income capacity. As she paid off each loan and borrowed a bigger one, she was able to slowly expand her business while continuing to almost single-handedly raise her younger children.

T., who lives in the village of Barangay Maytubig, Isabela, Negros Occidental, is 29 years old and married to Benny T. who works with her in managing their fish-vending business. They have two young children who are 6 and 8 years old. Her highest aspiration for her family is that her children be able to go to school, earn their college degrees and have all the opportunities to attain a bright future for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nThis is what motivated Christine and her husband Benny to engage in their fish-vending business, selling fish to regular customers in their community and even further to the neighboring barangays and sugar plantations. Delivering the fish to their customers was made easy with the aid of their tricycle - a motorcycle with a sidecar attached that can carry the fish containers. They were quite happy with their achievements at that point but then, in 2004, they knew they had the opportunity to expand their business if only they had the necessary capital.\r\n\r\nChristine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the new capital she needed to expand the business. As she paid off each loan and borrowed a larger one that she could afford to pay back, Christine and her husband's business improved. Later, with the extra capital, she was able to put up a general store adjacent to her house to cash in on the income opportunity that it offered. The two businesses now earn an average monthly income of PHP 12,000.\r\n\r\nFor her previous, 11th, loan Christine borrowed PHP 29,500 that was used as additional capital for her business and this loan was fully paid on time without any delays in the weekly installments. For her 12th loan she proposed the same amount of PHP 29,500 to be used for her fish vending and general store businesses. The income from it will be used as savings for her two young children\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nIn the picture Christine is shown standing outside her store window while her two young children peek out from inside her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

She makes around 20.000,00MT (U$700) per month selling clothes. \r\n\r\nThis is Emilia's first loan and she is asking for U$900 to buy more inventory for her clothing business. She hopes to be able to fill up the demand and get more clients. Meanwhile, she's been builiding a house with the help of her husband, and she dreams of the day their home will be ready.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":881.92,"image":{"id":400991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of clothing for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-06T21:40:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.08,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia  Custodio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1098.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1148.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1200.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1254.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1311.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1370.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1432.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1497.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1564.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1635.46},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1709.39},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1786.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1867.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1951.85},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2040.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2132.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.55,"local_amount":1098.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1114.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971859,"comment":null},{"amount":99.77,"local_amount":2771.3,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2812.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816797,"comment":null},{"amount":146.76,"local_amount":4076.64,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4137.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708980,"comment":null},{"amount":150.39,"local_amount":4177.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4239.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938040,"comment":null},{"amount":445.45,"local_amount":12876,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":13066.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":18.08,"payment_id":128971983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-11T03:47:01Z","paid_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142158,"name":"Jhasmin Noelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jhasmin is 19 years old, single, and lives with her mother.

She is 36 years old, divorced, and the mother of two children.  The children are 19 and 14 years old and both attend secondary school in the public schools of Boane.  Elina did not study beyond 7th grade because her early pregnancy made it impossible for her to continue her studies.  The old school system did not accept pregnant students in their classes.  Elina lives with her children in her own house in the district of Boane and also supports two siblings who live in another city (in the Khongolote neighborhood of Matola city).  <P>\r\n\r\nElina grew up with her parents and never left Boane.  She got together with her ex-husband in 1990, for a marriage that lasted only 9 years.  Soon after she got married, she began to earn an income.  She has a steady business selling basic necessity items at a market in Boane.  It earns approximately 4,500 MT (<em>meticais<\/em>) per month, which she uses to sustain the family and with which she is building a brick house in phases.<P>\r\n\r\nElina previously had loans from a similar microfinance institution (FDM).

The members sell food, supplies, bread, beer, groceries, toys and cosmetics.  During their tenure with Emprender, which has been 5 cycles, they are restructuring to 30% of the members.  B. Mery C. is the leader and president of the bank for the past 2 cycles, given that the bank already has completed 5 cycles.  That member has a grocery store.\r\n\r\nIn her community bank, she has learned to be a responsible leader with her friends, requiring the shares of her colleagues at the time of payment, being friendly and cheerful.  With the loan that has been granted, she will be able to increase store supplies, thus providing income for her family.  Mrs. Irene C. A. is the Treasurer of the bank and is one of the founders that led to the formation of the bank.  She sells food at fairs, festivals and social activities that occur.  She had no capital to start her own business, but now with the loan that she will be given, she will be able to buy raw materials to start her own business.\r\n\r\nThe member Sofia M. S. is rather dynamic, happy and is the Secretary of the bank.  During her tenure at the bank, she is always encouraging her colleagues.  To move forward, she now sells handbags, and the requested loan is required for the purchase of merchandise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sofia S. has a son, but this is not a limiting factor for her as she sells her

Cochapamba is characterized by its geography.  It has a lot of valleys and plains.  The climate is cold.  The people of the community work in farming and livestock.\r\n\r\nThis Communal Bank is comprised of a group of valiant women who are prepared to ride over any obstacle they encounter while always holding a vision for the future.\r\n\r\nJulia V. lives in the San Miguel Alto neighborhood, which is located on the way to the valley in the city of Cuenca.

The other two children are still in elementary school and high school.  The house they live in is hers, but it is half built.\r\n\r\nJulia has a business selling fruit.  She has worked at this business for a long time.  She does this only on the days of the free fair (in the market in Cuenca), which are Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday.

She tells us that raising animals is going well for her. \r\n\r\nJulia has worked with the Foundation for six years.  She has maintained a good relationship with her colleagues in the communal bank.  She tells us that the loans she received have allowed her to have economic tranquility.

They do not have a home of their own yet, which is why they rent.\r\n\r\nRosa has been working at a beauty salon for the past 3 years, from 8:00 am to noon and from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm Monday through Saturday.  She is also in the process of starting her own business selling cosmetics from the L\u2019Bel brand (beauty products for women).  She\u2019s been working at this for 7 months and says it\u2019s going well because her job helps build up her clientele. \r\n\r\nAt the Banco, Rosa is very amiable and gets along well with the other members.  This is her fifth lending cycle.  The loans have helped her establish herself financially, and with this current loan from ESPOIR she will invest in the purchase of more beauty products so she may offer a better variety to her clients.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to travel the world with her husband and sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maya Wisnievitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":400578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase L\u00b4bel beauty products for women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-06T21:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":184.7,"local_amount":184.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":184.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947524,"comment":null},{"amount":184.7,"local_amount":184.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":184.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789379,"comment":null},{"amount":88.95,"local_amount":88.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679815,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679816,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074396,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074397,"comment":null},{"amount":274.97,"local_amount":274.97,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910407,"comment":null},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":0.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946033,"comment":null},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T15:25:30Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142195,"name":"La Nueva Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a 49-year-old borrower who lives near San Pedro D.

Along with her youngest, a 15-year-old, Maria cares for a local 18-year-old girl who has a child of her own. Two of her children are currently studying in towns around the Dominican Republic, and the others now have families of their own. Maria lives in a batey called L. Blocks. Bateyes are communities built by sugar companies for their workers, and are usually very humble accommodations. Life in a batey can be harsh; they are difficult to access, receive no running water, lack sufficient sanitation, and have little to no electricity. \r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling vehicle necessities, including spare tires, oil, and gasoline. Maria also hopes to expand her business by selling prepaid cell-phone cards. Both her auto supplies and her cell-phone cards help the community have better access to the outsiD. world, and both are in high demand.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza, and she has been a hard-working borrower for over three years.
