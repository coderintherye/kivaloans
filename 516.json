people tend to complicate things, but for Merlita D. P., 44, life couldn't be simpler. Being a CCT* community partner of Talon, Amadeo, Cavite, Philippines, Merlita employs simple but effective principles to make her business grow. She is the wife of Orlando, a laborer, and is a mother to two college students.\r\n\r\nMerlita owns a sari-sari (variety) store in her neighborhood, where she sells items that are daily needed by people in her community. When a neighbor immediately needs a bottle of vinegar, a sachet of toothpaste, or some biscuits to eat, Merlita is ready to offer her merchandise. She also sells electronic load for mobile phones. Monthly, she earns around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Merlita is requesting for a Php20,000 loan. This is one simple way of energizing her business--adding to the array of items she has in her store to attract more customers with more options and to further meet their needs. She believes that with this loan money, she can undoubtedly increase her profits and make her store grow.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Merlita faces recently is the number of customers who do not pay their debts. She is also challenged by competition in the neighborhood, since many households in the Philippines put up a small sari-sari store to augment the family income. However, Merlita believes that challenges can be met by simply having faith in the Lord and exerting her best effort. She does not give up, because she knows that soon, the days will be brighter for her, both in her personal life and in her business. Just like any other parent, Merlita's simple dream is to see her children finish schooling.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":666709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of

Annabelle has been a CCT community partner since 2006. She graduated from college and is married to Danny, a security guard. Together they have three children.  One child is in high school, another is in elementary school, and the youngest is not yet of school age.\r\n\r\nAnnabelle manages a transportation business, renting out one motorcycle, a tricycle, and a van to local drivers. The drivers use the rented vehicles for public transport, and return them to Annabelle when the day is over. Aside from this, Annabelle also has a buy-and-sell business and a catering business. Through these businesses she earns around Php13,220 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her transportation business, Annabelle is requesting a Php45,000 loan. She intends to use the money for repairs and maintenance of her vehicles. She believes that this effort will ensure that her business will continue to run smoothly and earn a profit. \r\n\r\nIf there is one area where Annabelle seeks security, it is in the education of her children.  To ensure that there enough money for her children's tuition, Annabelle strives hard to make her businesses grow. As she motivated herself as a student, Annabelle encourages her children to grab the opportunity to learn.  At the end of the day, all she wants to see is her children having a secure future.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

E., age 58, lives in the Province of Kompong Cham, which is the best territory for farming. Yen E. is a married woman who is devoted to her four children. All of them are employed in different jobs, and they always share their salary with Yen E. every month. Yen E. and her husband have a few farms that they inherited from their grandparents. This couple now plant peanut and potato on their farmland, and they always get a good result from their crops. In Cambodia, we have two kinds of TV, one is color TV and the other one is black and white TV. People who live in the province use black and white TV, so they use battery to connect with their black and white TV for watching TV and to light their house.

He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He had two to three deliveries made each week. His sales have grown from 80,000 West African francs to between 150,000 and 300,000 franks. He sells wholesale, semi-wholesale and retail. He has saved a lot and was able to repay his loan without issues. \r\n\r\nThanks to his second loan, he would like to replenish his stock proceeding in a similar way. He is now thinking of placing large orders with Benin fishermen in Pointe Noire. Always very energetic, he is set on doing all he possibly can in order to become a major wholesaler trading in smoked fish, achieve a good income and be able to provide for his children\u2019s studies as well as to purchase a land plot for his family.

O. O. is 30 years old, married, and has one child whom they hope to give good education to the university level. His wife is a business woman.  His business is located on Kisumu's Oginga Odinga Street. Kisumu is the region in Kenya where Lake Victoria is located. Charles sells microphones, speakers, VCDs,  and DVDs to the local people. He has been in this business for eight years. His business is profitable and the major challenge he faces is that he does not have a permanent place to run his business. At times, Charles also gets harassed by the local government. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. Charles is using his  80,000 KES loan to buy more electronics to increase his business, especially during this festive season. He hopes to acquire a permanent retail shop within the town. He sees himself being the major supplier of electronics in the city in the future. He describes himself as honest and trustworthy.

is a married woman with two children, one of whom attends school, while the other one is still too young for school.  She owns a house that has electricity but not piped water.  Her greatest monthly expense is food for the family.\r\n\r\nShe has operated a retail shop for the past three years, selling to her neighbouring community.

With this loan, Justine says she is going to revamp her grocery business and also buy more bales of old clothes for resale. \r\n\r\nJustine belongs to Kasenge Women's group-Mukono."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4150,"image":{"id":666972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":" revamping her grocery store and purchasing more bales of clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dodo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Swaibu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rezilata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":9500000,"loan_amount":4150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1583333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1583333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1583333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1583333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1583333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":691.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":691.67,"local_amount":1583333,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1587380.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483361,"comment":null},{"amount":691.66,"local_amount":1583334,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1587381.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909997,"comment":null},{"amount":691.67,"local_amount":1583332.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1587380.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352507,"comment":null},{"amount":691.67,"local_amount":1583333.01,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1587380.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206218988,"comment":null},{"amount":691.66,"local_amount":1583334,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1587381.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211294064,"comment":null},{"amount":691.67,"local_amount":1583333,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1587380.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216573977,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-13T04:27:08Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":258712,"name":"Rwenshama Tukore Group B","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

After being laid off, Huey used his background in electronics to create the concept for Yard Sale Electronics in 2007. He started the business in 2008. The idea of owning his own business interested Huey, and he decided to \u201ctake the plunge.\u201d He thinks making a profit in a self-owned business is a powerful concept. In the future, he would like to expand his business into buying and selling other forms of electronics.\n\nHuey\u2019s loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana really helped his business. It gave him the capital to go back to school to take a couple of classes. The loan also helps him pay for a storage facility. He needs the storage space to keep the broken products that he buys before he takes them to his apartment to fix them. Once he has created a working product, he uses Ebay and Craig\u2019s List to sell his electronics.\n\nThe concept of microbusiness was something that Huey found compelling. He read about microfinancing for the first time in a newspaper article and was doing more research on his own when he came upon information about ACCION. He believes that microlending is a \u201cwinning idea\u201d and that the concept is going to catch on even more than it already has.  \n\nHuey describes himself as a true entrepreneur. He loves taking risks and took the risk to start his own business involving something he knows well \u2013 electronics. His advice to new business owners is to not be afraid of failing. He thinks people have to be brave to start their own business, but if they can get over their fear, it is worth it.\n\nCheck out his website at

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing clothes, shoes and calling cards. She operates a miscellaneous store. She will use the profits to buy some calves to raise and sell. She wants to have a big home for her whole family. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n\r\nOne of the people in the picture is not an active member active of the group, but was the founder (the one wearing white clothes at the

Primitiva's main job is buying and selling small animals, like pigs, hens, lambs, and guinea pigs, which she feeds and fattens up to later resell in the central market in the city of Tarma. However, a year ago, she bought an automobile for providing public transportation, covering the Palcamayo and Tarma routes. With this business, Primitiva says she has had very good results. There is little access to the villages that are far from town, where most of the residents have to get to the city to buy supplies and groceries, trade their crops and do other standalone jobs. Therefore, she is thinking of acquiring another automobile, with which she could make greater profits and meet the demand due to lack of mobility. This is her second loan with MFP, and as a new member of her communal bank, she is happy to be able to share her success with the other members.

","en":"This group is named \"Meloma\". It is made up of 8 very hard working women who live in the community of San Francisco La Loma. This community belongs to the municipality of San Jose del Rincon in Mexico. San Francisco La Loma's population consists of families who are agriculturists and farmers. There are also merchants who have general stores or those who travel to the various plazas to sell their products, such as plastics, belts, and clothing.\r\n\r\nThe group \"Meloma\" is not different from other group because the 8 members are house wives who have a business on the side. The women of the group are the following: \r\n\r\n1.-Francisca C. M.: she is 45 years old and she is a merchant who sells clothing for the entire family in the plazas.\r\n2.-Maria Guadalupe M. M.: she is 41 years old, she is a house wife, and she raises chickens which she later sells. \r\n3.-Maria Guadalupe R. R.: she is 73 years old and she raises livestock. Currently she raises pigs.\r\n4. - Jovita M. S.: she is 50 years old and she has a convenience store.\r\n5.-Maria del Carmen T. R.: She is 47 years old and she has a convenience store.\r\n6.-Isidra T. D.: She is 44 years old and she raises chickens which she later sells.\r\n7.-Maria Luisa R. R.: she is 26 years old, the youngest in the group, had she also goes out to the plazas to sell clothing\r\n8.-Margarita C. M.: she is 47 years old and she is the leader of the group. She raises livestock. Usually she raises sheep and chickens.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group know each other since they were children. They decided on the name \"Meloma\" because it is the nickname of the community: San Francisco de la Loma is \"Meloma\".\r\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the community is Mazahua, meaning that the majority of the adult population speak this dialect. But the kids have stopped learning the language, which is why the primary schools are trying to bring back the language so that it will not be lost. Language class is one of the courses kids take in school.\r\n\r\nMargarita, who they affectionately cal Mago, is a Mazahua. She is married and she has 11 children. She has been married for 33 years. She lives in her own home and she lives together with her husband. Of the 11 children, 2 passed away so she only has 9 left; four are girls and 5 are boys. \r\n\r\nThere are two that depend on Mago. Her 11-year old son is in grade 5 and she has a 4-year old granddaughter. They are her two last dependents. Mago's husband is an agriculturist. He doesn't have a steady job but whenever a construction job becomes available he takes it to have more money. \r\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned that Mago is a leader in her community. There are people that follow her and support her in the decisions that she takes. \r\n\r\nFor the most part the population is made up of simple and humble individuals with integrity and they support each other as needed.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":666049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase sheep and chickens to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-17T18:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3875},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3875,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3896.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691537,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7792.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430735,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7792.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849998,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":7792.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292271,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3875,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3896.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160552,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T02:09:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":258876,"name":"Marcos Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl se\u00f1or Marcos Antonio F.

She has been in the business for four years and she started out to help her husband with the household expenses. She goes out to sell to the teachers in various schools and to her neighbors. She has this business thanks to her mother-in-law because she was the one who encouraged her to work in the sale of products through catalogues. Gaby requests a loan from Fundacion (Kiva Field Partner) in order to invest in the purchase of beauty products and household products. She is married to Ernesto, a day laborer. They have two children, Alejandro who is 9 years old and in primary school, and Alonso who is 5 years old and in kindergarten. Gaby's goal is to set up a store from her house because there is room to accommodate it. She wants to set up an office supply store and toy store.  There are no other businesses like this one near her home and this would be the realization of a dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":666438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-17T18:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1168.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691539,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430739,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1558.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850000,"comment":null},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1948.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292273,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T20:02:49Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":258892,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Rosa Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Madriz, cuenta con 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casada desde hace 24 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Francisco que se dedica a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, ellos tienen 5 hijos, Erika de 22 a\u00f1os, Cristian de 20 a\u00f1os, Pablo que tiene 16 a\u00f1os quien le ayuda con los gastos de la casa, Dulce Mar\u00eda de 8 a\u00f1os de edad y Francisco de 6 a\u00f1os ambos estudiantes de primaria, ella es originaria de la localidad de San Jose Purua ubicado en el estado de Michoac\u00e1n.

U. is from the village of Maningning, Salawagan, Valencia City. She is 21 years old. Jessame is married and has 1 infant child. To make a living, Jessame owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and snack foods in the local community. Jessame has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jessame joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jessame has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital. Jessame is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like snack foods and  beverages. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jessame from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":667600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He shares it with is wife and one of their children, who still lives at home.\r\n\r\nHernan owns a hectare of land in the region, on which he has lime trees.

He can regularly be found trimming his trees, to improve their productivity, or harvesting limes.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the lime orchard, Hernan and his wife raise sheep in corrals behind their home.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nHeidi dreams to be able to have her own business stall soon, just as she fervently wishes her children finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

S. is from the village of Western, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 50 years old. Bienvenida is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Bienvenida owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general  alteration & tailoring services like school uniforms to local community members. Bienvenida has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 15000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bienvenida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bienvenida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads. Bienvenida is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Bienvenida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

is from the mountainous province of Antipolo, Rizal.

To make a living, Melodena owns and operates a plastic wares business in the local community. \r\n\r\nMelodena has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a week for these activities. In 2006, Melodena joined ASHI to secure access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.\r\n\r\nMelodena has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI. This previous loan was used in her business. Melodena is requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional stock of her business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Melodena from ASHI. She plans to use the additional proceeds generated from the business to develop business.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can reach her ambition of moving out of poverty, expand her business, and pay for the needs of her children in school. \r\n\r\nShe says thank you to all Kiva lenders across the world for supporting her dreams and offering financial services to poor women who want to get ahead. She prays that they all should be blessed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":667892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics

She is 19 years old and married. To make a living, Cherrie Mae owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.

This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Cherrie Mae from HSPFI.

Her previous loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, thereby improving her family's standard of living. Now, she is seeking a second loan, this time in the amount of 10,000 ($250), which she intends to use to purchase inventory to sell so that she can continue to save up for her family's future needs.

She is 21 years old. Elena is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Elena owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for Elena's business comes primarily from buying and selling vegetables like squash, eggplants, tomatoes, amplaya and spices, garlic, and onions in her local community. Elena has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elena joined the Hagdan sa Pag-uswag Foundation, Inc.

Elena is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elena from HSPFI.

During winter, he sells mare's milk (fermented milk), which is very profitable to sell. Currently he owns two horses and three cows. For the future, he plans to increase the number of his livestock. Because of his business success, he has used his earnings to provide for his family. He says, \" All I want is to have my own farm.\" Serikbol is requesting a 800,000 MNT loan to purchase more hay to feed his livestock.
