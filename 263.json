Habib lives with his family in Istaravshan town. Through much effort he dedicates himself to the production of grapes. He tends to his crop himself, with the help of his son.\r\n\r\nOne of Habib\u2019s biggest problems is the harvesting of his product and, due to distance, he sells his crop piecemeal which reduces his income which he uses to support his family.\r\n\r\nHabib has asked for a loan of 2,500 USD that will be used for the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. This will allow him greater earnings which, in turn, would improve his family\u2019s standard of living.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Coming from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Tulkinboy has been selling cattle since 2004. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Today Tulkinboy would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting this first loan to purchase young cattle. Tulkinboy has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business.\n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At 51, and married with four adult children, she strives hard to make all her business ventures lucrative so that she can provide a bright future for her children.\r\n\r\nNelly started with only one small \"sari-sari\" or general store attached to her house. When she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, she decided to use the money she borrowed to sell fish in her community. Later, she added a small cafeteria beside her general store. The reason why she diversified her business was because of the growing number of \"sari-sari\" or general stores being set up in their community competing with her own business.\r\n\r\nWith her various ventures, Nelly feels more financially stable, and offering more to her customers has actually given her an edge over her competitors. Now she wants to borrow PHP 15,000 for her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon to use as her rolling capital for her fish-selling business. She plans to use the income from this venture to pay for the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n   "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":374494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Neli Victoria is a member of the community bank Mujeres Progresistas (Progressive Women), a very solid little bank, supportive, and united.  For many years they have been making loans, and they are very grateful people because thanks to the loans they have succeeded in improving themselves and moving their families forward, offering them a decent life.  They are very proud of their achievements.  As a group they are very happy and extroverted, and they all get along very well between them.  Here is a statement from a member.  \r\n<p>\r\nNeli lives in the center of Cuenca, in the streets Gaspar Sangurima and Antonio Borrero.  She is 41 years old, has 2 children: one is 20, and the other one is 9 years old.  Her older child graduated this year from the high school Francisco Tamariz, and her younger son studies in the school Julio Matovelle.  They live in a rented house, and her husband migrated abroad in order to give them a better future and as they have legalized his situation, he returns home to see them when time permits or on special dates.   \r\n<p>\r\nNeli has a costume jewelry business, which is going very well.  Her work schedule is from 8 in the morning until 6.30 in the evening.  The advantage of having her own business is that with the profits that she earns, she pays for the apartment and her commercial premises.\r\n<p> \r\nShe gets along very well with the members of the bank, and they are all very good friends.  In the foundation, she feels very well attended, and happy with the benefits that she receives.  This is her third cycle with the foundation, and the loan that they will make is for the expansion of her business, purchasing merchandise with new models and designs in order to satisfy the requests of her customers.  Neli's dream is to travel and to get to know some places around the world.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":374061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"Expand her business and buy merchandise with new models and designs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T18:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neli Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035165,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035166,"comment":null},{"amount":95.06,"local_amount":95.06,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":95.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947423,"comment":null},{"amount":42.43,"local_amount":42.43,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789273,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789274,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679693,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679694,"comment":null},{"amount":183.36,"local_amount":183.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":183.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074315,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They have fulfilled loans for many years. They are the most grateful individuals since they have been able to improve their standard of living for themselves and their families. This is apparent since they can offer them a suitable life and are very proud of their accomplishments. The group as a whole is cheerful and extroverted. They get along well among themselves. Here is a testimony from one of their members.\r\n\r\nMaria lives in the center of the city, Cuenca, is 57 years old, and is a widow now four years and a half. She has 6 children ranging from ages 27, 24, 22, 20, 17, and 14. They are all single. They work and study except for the two youngest who only study and help around the house. Her eldest daughter is in Chile earning a master\u2019s degree in hydro-sanitary and appraisal. They do not own a home of their own.\r\n\r\nMaria works as a private employee in the Educational Unit, The American, and the best thing about working in this institution is that she has a fixed income.

She and her husband have 4 daughters who attend high school.  Elia sells river fish of all varieties and sizes from her post in the informal market.  Her work schedule runs from 6am to 11am and she has been doing this for the past 9 years.  Occasionally one of her daughters will come with her to help tend to the customers.  What she likes most about her job is that she gets to sell and take good care of people, especially her regular clients.  In addition, her business is very profitable because she earns a daily income and gets better returns because she buys her fish directly from the river port at a lower price.

The greatest disadvantage lies in the competition that exists. \r\n<p>\r\nLuz has worked with the bank for 5 years and is happy with the training the Foundation has provided her.  Luz will use the loan the Foundation is giving her to invest in her salon as she needs to purchase some materials. Her goal is to purchase a car so that she can use it to go to different parts of the city..\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rocio Vargas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":374737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of instruments for her beauty salon such as hair dryers, curling irons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T18:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":226.44,"local_amount":226.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":226.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035177,"comment":null},{"amount":224.7,"local_amount":224.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":224.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947432,"comment":null},{"amount":7.21,"local_amount":7.21,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789283,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789284,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679697,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679698,"comment":null},{"amount":366.64,"local_amount":366.64,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":366.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074317,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He is 48 years old, lives alone in his own home, and has been separated for the past 20 years.  He has a 17 year old son who is studying in the city of Tarma, which is 5 hours away by car from his home.  Esteban enjoys his work.  As a young man, he liked to engage in hard labor and taking care of plants because he knew these activities could bring in a good income.  For this reason, he gets up early in the morning to remove all the weeds and shrubs around his plantation.  He enjoys planting coffee the most even though it takes three years for the crop to mature.  Estaban also likes the harvest season when he can bring his goods to market and earn a good profit.

Diosdada is requesting a loan of 5,000 ,which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan Diosdada has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":375069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to invest in expanding her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Isidro, Talakag, Bukidnon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T18:36:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diosdada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1806.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73611285,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1505.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87048067,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96960839,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103803578,"comment":null},{"amount":6.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":301.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110694507,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T20:25:44Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:12:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":131483,"name":"Lila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lila S., 30 years old, lives in Bholdhoka, Lalitpur.

He is 25 years old and lives alone in a rented room.  He is eager to keep improving himself and hopes to have a family one day that lacks nothing.  Serafin works by himself every day manufacturing bricks.  Every morning, he wakes up early to mix the materials and mold the bricks before baking them in an oven.  He is not afraid of hard work and is motivated by his desire to overcome and improve his quality of life.  What he likes most about his job is that he has time for other activities that are important to him, such as pursuing his studies or visiting his parents.  In the five years he has been in business, he believes the most difficult part of his job is loading the heavy bricks onto the large trucks that haul them away to be sold.  He hopes to buy an oven for baking bricks because the one he uses right now is rented, and much of his revenue goes toward paying the rental fees.  \r\n<p>\r\nSerafin is taking his first loan with MFP and he is happy to have this opportunity.  He is confident that he will make his payments on time and has great respect for the other members of his Communal Bank.

She and her husband, Reiner, have six children, ages 5 to 19 years old. She wants all of her children to have their own career someday, so she wants to send all of them to school until they graduate from college. With only her husband\u2019s income from his job as a utility worker, this may not turn into reality. Her husband\u2019s income is sufficient only for food and other basic needs, but not when educational expenses are included. \r\n\r\nAsuncion Gemma wanted her own business so she could have her own income. Her motivation led her to Ahon Hirap, Inc. (ASHI). In 2003, Asuncion Gemma became a member of ASHI and has taken a loan to staring her business. She started with one business, but after several loans, Gemma now has several businesses. \r\n\r\nShe raises hogs, cattle, and chickens, and she buys and sells rice. The profits from her livestock businesses have doubled. It takes four months to raise a pig, one year to raise a cow, and 45 days to raise a chicken. When the animal is mature, they are sold in the market, either alive or slaughtered. \r\n\r\nAsuncion Gemma sells rice from their own house. Her customers are her neighbors. She is now planning to buy and sell coconut from her house as well.\r\n \r\nThrough the loans that she can get from ASHI, if she maintain her good performance as a member, Asuncion Gemma foresees her businesses succeeding and growing.

She started the business with her husband right after graduating high school  Today, her mother-in-law also helps out by watching the baby for them when they are at work.

M. is 46 years old and is married to a fisherman. She has four children ranging in age from 15 to 24 years old. She joined Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) in 2003, requesting a business loan because she has to augment her husband's sporadic income to be able to send all of their children to school until college. Her loan was used to finance her husband's livelihood of fishing. It has been nine years that this business has been Jocelyn's main source of income. She sells the fish her husband has caught every day in the market. Jocelyn has been able to have a hog fattening (pig raising) business from her profits. The profits she has with this business are twice as much as the capital. Income with this business is every four months and timely to support the semester tuition fees of her three children in college. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is applying for now, Jocelyn plans to expand the fishing business and also to finance her hog fattening business. She knows she can afford to pay larger amounts of weekly amortization in ASHI if her business grows. Another factor that influences her courage is her very supportive husband and cooperative children.

S., age 49, is married and has three children.

She is asking for a loan of 1000 USD to purchase a motorbike for her husband to operate in an additional business as a motor-taxi driver.

They know what they are going to do to earn their livelihood. The group's leader, Damira, is among them. A 36-year-old hairdresser and mother of three children, Damira has dedicated many years to her occupation. She was just a 16-year-old girl when she finished hairdressing courses. She swiftly learned all aspects of her profession, providing all kinds of hair-related services: various haircuts, hair dyeing styles, hair setting, and hairdos (e.g., waved, curled, perm, marcel waves, etc.). She has become an A1 specialist. She has assigned a room and adjusted it to be a hairdressing salon. By saving her profits, she recently purchased a car. Damira feels that she can do better and that she is just not using all the opportunities. So, she has planned to make an improvement at her salon. She is firmly convinced that if she furnishes and decorates her salon, more customers will be attracted. Damira needs a loan to equip her salon with shelves and wallpaper. In the near future, she is going to expand her business by taking on a few apprentices. People do grow when they have a vision of how to do that.\r\n<p>\r\nDamira\u2019s partners: <br>\r\nGulzina, age 44 and mother of two children, works as a cleaner at a casino. She needs a loan to buy building materials for her kitchen and to buy a chandelier. <br>\r\nJumabu is age 56. She and her husband are farmers. They have three children. They need a loan to buy fuels and lubricants, as well as to pay for transportation services and to pay workers for harvesting. <br>\r\nEdilbek, age 35, is married and has one child. He works as an assistant station-master in \"Tuz\" substation. He needs a loan to place a crusher at the same substation and to buy some cement for installing it. <br>\r\nAida, age 38, is a housewife. She sells milk and also produces cheese and butter. She needs a loan to buy a milk cow. <br>\r\nNazgul, age 38, is married. She has three children. To make a living she sells yogurt, sour cream and cottage cheese. She hopes to get a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?<br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Her husband is a welder.\r\n\r\nShowing thrift and patience Aihan and her husband managed to save some funds, namely $715, from her husband\u2019s earnings and opened up a business in a market. Now Aihan sells women\u2019s clothes. The fact, that Aihan has started making profits and bringing money home has greatly influenced their lives in a good way. Though her monthly income barely reaches $120, at least Aihan has become able to feed her children better.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Aihan urgently needs a loan to purchase school uniforms and more women\u2019s clothes, because very soon in September school season starts. Her future plans are to buy premises for opening a cash-and-carry shop.\r\n\r\nAihan\u2019s partners are Aisada, Adylbek and Dinara.\r\n\r\nAisada, 33, sells women\u2019s clothes in a market. She has three children and the little one is just two and half years old. A $350 loan allowed her to start her business. Now she makes well over a half of that sum each month. Aisada needs a loan to purchase more school uniforms and women\u2019s clothes. Her dream is to buy a big house for her family.\r\n\r\nAdylbek, 45, is married. To provide for his wife and granddaughter he works as a taxi-driver. He worked hard in Russia and upon return to his homeland was able to buy a car. Now he earns around $240 a month. Adylbek wants to have an additional source of money and has decided to purchase livestock: sheep and a milk cow. He hopes to get a loan for this purpose.\r\n\r\nDinara, 39, is married and is the mother of three children. Her husband is a farmer, whereas she sells men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes and shoes. Her business has given her an opportunity to buy a car: a micro-bus. Recently they moved from a house to a flat.

Conducting business at home, her husband regularly works as a welder, while Kulmira trades in milk, buying from villagers and reselling it in a market. One of her sons mends cell phones and the other son sells milk and cheese.  As well, the whole family receives orders and provides Western-style renovation services.  The family\u2019s eight-year activity has allowed them to buy a car and furniture. Kulmira\u2019s current income is around $240 per month. <p>\r\n\r\nNow, the next project is to buy a milk cow. Because Kulmira values time and does not want to lose time saving money, she hopes to get a loan to hasten the process of acquiring the cow. In the future, she has pretty determined plans of opening a cheese-producing factory, increasing the number of livestock, and buying new furniture for the house. <p>\r\n\r\nKulmira\u2019s partners are Kulsina, Salyi and Nurgul.  Kulsina, 59, married to a metalworker, has five children. In addition to being a housewife, she manages to keep a cow and four sheep for reselling. Even though they do not have much livestock, they have been able to increase their number.  She is requesting a loan to purchase sheep.<p>\r\n\r\nSalyi, 51, is the divorced mother of a 19-year-old-daughter. To earn a living, she sells traditional items of manufacture, beddings and pillows, a craft she learned from her relatives.  Salyi requests a loan to buy a sewing machine and fabric. <p>\r\n\r\nNurgul, 34, is a married mother of two children. Nurgul\u2019s husband vulcanizes tires, while she manufactures traditional articles, a skill she learned from her mother. She is in need of a loan to buy materials for manufacture. Her plan is to expand her range of goods, buy an electric sewing machine, and renew the furniture. <p>\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

is a retailer of cell phone loads in their village at Barangay Antagan 1st of Tumauini, Isabela. She wants to borrow PHP 6,000 from Kiva lenders for her load-retailing business. Both SMART and GLOBE subscribers are being served by Charlita in their village, bringing easier communication for relatives, friends and lovers that are away from their loved ones.\r\n\r\nSometimes, due to other financial needs of her family, Charlita was not able to buy load wallets for the retailing of cell phone loads. Thus, she wants to borrow from Kiva lenders to maintain the business and someday be able to expand in other networks like Sun Cellular. She plans to utilize the entire loan for her business if her request is granted.\r\n\r\nCharlita is already 47 years old. She is married to a farmer who also works as a house carpenter. They have four children namely: Ferdinand, the eldest, a high school graduate and already married; the same with their second child Ryan;  third is Romer, who has stopped studying; and lastly is Grave, their youngest, who is currently enrolled in third year high school. Charlita really wanted to send them to finish their schooling in college, but it is their own decision to stop in their studies. She is hoping that her youngest child will earn a degree in college to be able to have a much better future than what they have at present.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":372775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

As a homemaker, Estela's means to generate income are very limited and she is unable to augment her husband's income because she has no access to business capital.  However, this month, Estela joined Kiva partner ASHI to request a loan to finance her husband's long time business of producing rice.  Estela plans to eventually have a business buying and selling rice so that, aside from their own harvest, she can also help other farmers market their rice. \r\n<p>\r\nEstela realises how important a business could be to augment the family income.

From her business, she is generating an income of PHP250 each day, an amount being budgeted to their daily expenses. Esperanza would like to expand her business to be more profitable, thus could support their grandchildren who are already growing in numbers.  Esperanza is asking to obtain a loan amounting to PHP9, 000 to be used as her additional revolving capital for her business. She plans to purchase stocks of grocery items and hopefully her general store will also become more competent from other stores in their village.
