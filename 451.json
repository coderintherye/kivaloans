S. is 57 years old. She is a busy entrepreneur and wishes to be able to help her children and provide a decent life. She makes and sells ice cream products and closely works with her husband as an ice cream vendor. She started the business 12 years ago to help her family meet basic needs as everything is very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more ingredients for her ice cream products, so she needs more capital to meet the demand in her customers in the local area where she sells her ice cream. She is pleased because, in the past, she has managed to utilize the loans to invest in her ventures.\r\n\r\nWith working capital Cecilia\u2019s business will continue growing and she will be able to provide good service to her regular customer. Through the support of KIVA lenders, Cecilia hopes to see herself and her family, who currently live in poverty, soon change their quality of living, \r\n\r\nCecilia\u2019s long-term goal is to have an ice cream booth a few years from now so that she can give an opportunity of employment to others specially her extended relatives in their community. Cecilia hopes to maintain a long-term sustainable ice cream business. \r\n\r\nDuring her 12 years as a member of ASHI, Cecilia has shown very good performance with her group mates and center. Having this loan will enable her to finally achieve her dreams in life: to have a successful business, fund the educational needs of her children until they finish college, and have a better life and a happy family as well. Cecilia is very thankful to ASHI and KIVA for the continued support of her dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":589951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She applies for a loan of Php 24,000 to fund their plan to expand their vegetable (Kangkong) plantation. It\u2019s been three years since the couple got into this business and they have realized that profit is good because vegetables are in demand with Filipinos.  They want to purchase raw materials such as bamboo poles, straw and construct 5 rafts that they will use to gather said vegetable. They are expecting P 10,000 additional monthly profit from this business.  \r\n\r\nThe couple's dream is to be able to establish a good business and increase their profit so that they can renovate their house, provide for their daily needs and send their children to a nice school. Margie also wishes to help people in their community by hiring them during harvest time on their plantation and in production of doormats. \r\n\r\nShe wishes that people from ASHI and KIVA partners will help them achieve this plan. The couple also wishes to convey their sincere gratitude to both institutions for providing capital to poor families without collateral and encouraging people like them to bring out their skills and potentials so as to be able to rise from poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":589977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"raw

She would also like to buy appliances for them to enjoy and provide for their daily basic needs. Her dream is to send her child to college and finish a degree.

S., 37, who wants to achieve more in life not just for herself but for her family as well. Marissa lives in GMA, Cavite with her husband, Hermogenes, who is a jeepney driver. They have three children, one of whom is in elementary graD., and the other two are already married.\r\n\r\nMarissa is in the business of direct selling brand apparel, cosmetics, footwear, and accessories, which cater mainly to people near their residence in GMA. Direct selling of beauty products and other items depends largely on Marissa'a perseverance and social connections. Marissa and Hermogenes gather a net income of Php10,000 monthly, which they use to meet the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nMarissa admits that she needs a Php13,000 loan to enhance her business and increase her profits. She applied to CCT* for this loan, which she plans to use to further her direct selling business, which includes brands such as Avon, Natasha and MSE. Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Marissa to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nAt present, Marissa sees that her business is not that profitable. She also experiences problems in collection and dealing with customers, and even balancing the time for family and business.

Her husband combines his job as mechanic at the company \u201cShumkar\u201d and cattle breeding. Aizat is a worker at the company \u201cShumkar\u201d and gets 6500 monthly. After their marriage, ten years ago, they started cattle breeding together from purchase of a cow. Together, they increased livestock numbers to thirteen and the cattle number to two. Monthly, cattle breeding brings 9000 soms. \r\n\r\nNow, Aizat and her husband are preparing their house for the winter period. In order to provide living conditions for their children, they need to make repairs at their house. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t have a sufficient amount of money.

He started it with 20,000 soms, and it now brings 10,000 soms each month. He is planning to build a big house for his family. Unfortunately, he cannot yet afford it. Therefore, he decided to make just repairs at his house. However, he doesn\u2019t have enough funds.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinara K., 31, is the leader of this group. She is a widow with three children: her two sons are 12 and 14 and her daughter is 4 years old. Her two sons go to school and her daughter goes to kindergarten. Dinara is a junior nurse at a center of family medicine. She also breeds cattle. At one time, her husband received twelve sheep as dividends so they decided to start cattle breeding. Dinara already has four years of experience in cattle breeding and earns 3,000 KGS monthly. With the profits from cattle breeding, she has bought household appliances. She is applying for a loan in order to buy hay for the cattle so that she may continue breeding them. In the future, she is planning to raise her children and give them high-quality education.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\nGulmira B. is the treasurer of the group. She is 50 and married, with three children. Her elder daughter is married and lives independently, her second daughter is 17 and her son is 12. Her daughter entered Kyrgyz National University and her son goes to school. Her husband is a pensioner and his retirement allowance is 1,600 KGS per month. Gulmira is an accountant. Together with her husband, Gulmira breeds cattle; however, since her husband is already a pensioner, he does most of the work. They started cattle breeding with a purchase of two bulls for 30,000 KGS. They already have ten years of experience in this business and make 6,000 KGS monthly. With the help of the profits, they raised their elder daughter, gave her higher education and bought dowry when she got married. They also were able to use the profits to give their second daughter the opportunity to study at an institution of higher education and have bought a car for the family. They are applying for a loan in order to buy one more bull, fatten and resell it. With these profits, they are planning to buy a dowry for their second daughter.\r\n\r\nNurlan K. is 37 and married. He has three children: his daughter is 5 and his sons are 1 and 3 years old. His wife is a housewife. Nurlan is an expert for the company \u201cARIS\u201d. He also breeds cattle. He decided to start cattle breeding 17 years ago by using his first salary to purchase cattle. He started cattle breeding with an initial investment of 5,000 KGS and he now makes 7,000 KGS monthly. He is applying for loan in order to buy hay for the cattle. \r\n\r\nNazira M. is 37 and married. She has two children: her daughter is 8 and her son is 5 years old. Both of them go to school. Her husband is a taxi driver and he receives 8,000 KGS monthly. Two months ago, upon their neighbors' suggestion, they decided to sell vegetables. Since Nazira\u2019s husband is a taxi driver, he drives daily to the capital where he can buy vegetables and other convenience goods at wholesale prices. He then brings them to their town and Nazira sells them at a higher price to the local population. Nazira can make 3,000 KGS per month because she has no transportation costs. Nazira is applying for a loan in order to increase their turnover in purchasing vegetables this autumn. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

G., age 48, is married with three children, one in school, one working, and one currently at home.

For the past sixteen years, Marilou has owned and run her own sari-sari store (general store) selling snacks, soft drinks, and other goods. \r\n\r\nMarilou has requested a loan of PHP 31,000 to help her expand her inventory, and hopefully attract new customers. Marilou is looking to expand her business and finds that the loans allow her to buy inventory in bulk, saving on transportation costs and allowing her to spend more time running the store.  \r\n\r\nMarilou has been a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) since 2008 and has consistently attended weekly fellowship meetings.*  She hopes that her business will continue to generate income and that her family will live a happy and stable life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance

A dream for most Filipino parents like Arlene, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nArlene operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene gets supplies at wholesale prices and sells them at a per piece rate. Arlene\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nArlene dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Noorah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy bales of second-hand clothing. \r\n\r\nThe main business challenge for Noorah is the transportation of bales of clothing from Owino market to her shop in Kyebando. Her goals and aspirations for her business are to buy land and build rooms to rent. She decided to join MCDT because of good customer care. Noorah lives in a home that she rents; she has access to electricity but she doesn't have access to piped water. Her major monthly expenses include medication, food, rent, and school fees.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":590207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy bales of second-hand clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2010-08-26T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noorah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":14200},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19200},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":18400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.1,"local_amount":28200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":31964.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166885216,"comment":null},{"amount":35.5,"local_amount":71000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80478.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172152474,"comment":null},{"amount":28.5,"local_amount":56800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":64382.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177447594,"comment":null},{"amount":121.9,"local_amount":244000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":276574,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182586802,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is married with three children. Her first child is 19 years old. The next is 16 and the last is 10 years old. In the family of Donathe everybody is jobless. Donathe works hard in order to provide all that is needed for her children. Donathe has been a businesswoman since 2006. In fact, Donathe sells various foodstuffs and she said these products are profitable, which is the reason why she chose this kind of business. Donathe is serious in her daily activities. That is the reason she is the group representative of the five members. Each of the members has a different business. All the businesses are organized, obviously, because they have a start and end time.

He is a full-time farmer and solely depends on the income from his farming to provide for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nSamwel has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 50,000 Kenyan Shillings to purchase a dairy cow. He says that the income from this loan will help pay school fees for his children and this will raise their standards of living. His biggest challenges have been difficulty in finding the right type of breed and that the veterinary services available are not reliable. In five years time, he would want to have improved his dairy farming by keeping the right dairy breeds and building them modern dairy units.\r\n\r\nSamwel is 43 years old and married with eight children between the ages of 5 and 20.

is a farmer from the town of Litein in the Rift Valley of Kenya. He has been farming for 10 years and employs one farmhand. His mixed farm produces milk, tomatoes, cabbages and tea. He also earns income from his poultry farming and computer printing services.\r\n\r\nKipkirui is 38 years old. He is married and has been blessed with 3 children, ages 3, 9 and 14. All the children attend school. Kipkirui has requested this second loan of 60,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow. He says that the extra income from this loan will enable him to pay his children's school fees, feed the family and assist other members of his family. He says that this loan will improve his family's living standards.

He works in business in a store that is very well known in this area, where he sells provisions, meals, liquors, and soft drinks. He began as an assistant in this same business, and since its long-time owner needed to travel to take care of his property in the Magdalena region, Mauricio stayed in the store through a lease contract. In the year 2005 he bought the store and succeeded in positioning himself in the market; this he did through  much discipline, good service, and saving, and this success filled him with great satisfaction. Indeed, with his great sense of responsibility, Mauricio succeeded in obtaining several loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. They have helped him a lot, since before he worked with very little capital to stock his store. Recently he has benefited from Kiva loans, and this would be his third loan from this organization. He needs the loan to buy larger quantities of oil, rice, and liquors to prepare for the end-of-year fiestas that are coming. With this loan his store is going to be well stocked. His business is his only source of income and for this reason he focuses his efforts on the growth of his store, since he dreams of seeing it fully furnished, well provided with glass cases and shelving, but always well stocked, so that he has everything his customers want when they arrive at his store.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

She gets the fresh fish from the local dock, about a 45-minute walk from where she lives, or occasionally from the fishermen who live in her area. Mar\u00eda then processes the fish and sells it in various markets in the region. The work makes her feel useful and she is able to help her husband with household expenses.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants to buy more fresh fish so she can expand her business and increase earnings. In order to achieve this goal she approached Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa to ask for a loan of 1,500 soles which she will use to give her business the boost necessary to increase sales.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdelena is a responsible and calm person. Her greatest wish is to carry on working so she can provide her children with a better quality of life. She has worked in the past with our institution and has shown punctuality and responsibility with her repayments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":590370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fresh fish to process and sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 -

She decided to start up this business because she saw that the school kids were renting these costumes at very high prices. she acquired some costumes and started renting them at better prices, a venture that has been very successful, especially during the holiday seasons such as the Week of the child, Mother's Day, Father's day, and for national holiday parades. For the past 8 years she has worked as both a teacher and a business owner and she has seen great success, giving her a great deal of personal pleasure. In the future she hopes to have her own sewing shop to design her own children's costumes and increase her earnings. This is her second loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). In her previous loan she has been on time and she plans on keep that up. She has earned the respect of her community group. This loan will be destined to purchase various fabrics to have costumes made so that she may continue to rent them out.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":590388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase fabrics to create children's costumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":296.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":309.8},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":326.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":339.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":356.32},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":372.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.03},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.31,"local_amount":296.03,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":300.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154541,"comment":null},{"amount":230.61,"local_amount":636.15,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":645.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449853,"comment":null},{"amount":123.03,"local_amount":339.41,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":344.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588546,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":356.32,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":361.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725058,"comment":null},{"amount":134.88,"local_amount":372.09,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":377.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887329,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T17:33:06Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226355,"name":"Fuerza Divina 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is the coordinator of her group Fuerza Divina 5 (Divine Force).

She lives in the house she inherited from her parents. She lives with her 2 children and her grandson Piero who is 6 years old. \r\n\r\nFor many years she took orders for items of clothing for her clients. Ten months ago she managed to set up a stand in the interior of the most visited market in the region. Since them she gets up early in the morning to prepare the day's food for the kids and then she makes her way to her stand. She is fascinated by her business. She generally works alone but when she goes out to make her purchases she requests assistance from her sister-in-law, so that she does not miss out on any sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to make her business grow by selling locally made items of clothing as well as imported goods, to have the clients' interest. This is the first loan she requests from MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to the obligations of the loan.

With this loan he believes he can increase it to 500 AZN and improve the living conditions of his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":590450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilayet ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":900,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":192.3,"local_amount":153.84,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":154.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172066580,"comment":null},{"amount":95.49,"local_amount":76.39,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-27T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":76.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182802610,"comment":null},{"amount":88.92,"local_amount":71.14,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189113558,"comment":null},{"amount":193.19,"local_amount":154.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T22:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":155.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191532632,"comment":null},{"amount":188.86,"local_amount":151.09,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201229666,"comment":null},{"amount":186.42,"local_amount":149.14,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":149.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093037,"comment":null},{"amount":179.82,"local_amount":143.85,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":144.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T04:27:24Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226380,"name":"Martha Gricely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Gricely, tiene 53 a\u00f1os.

He lives there with them, his wife Haydee, who is 28 years old, and their 2 small children. They live together in a quiet spot in the cold mountainous region in central Peru. Every day is different for this agricultural worker. He gets up when the sun rises and sets out to take care of his fields. After spending the morning carefully tending his potato and olluco (root crop) plants, he is ready to head back to his rams waiting in the stable. He takes them out to graze, accompanied and supported by his wife. He says he likes agricultural work a lot because it is quite gentle and profitable. He manages to sell the potatoes and olluco he grows at reasonable prices. Whenever he goes through a period of crop shortage or has any debt outstanding, he sells some of his animals at the market in the city. He has many plans for the future, among them to purchase a plot of land on which to sow in large quantities, as he wants to increase his profits.

She lives in her own house with her 3 young children who help her in her agricultural work. Ever since she found herself raising 3 children alone, she decided to dedicate herself to her work even more. She continued planting potatoes and olluco in her own fields. When her children were young, they began to help her in this very laborious work.  Since then, the four of them work every day to get ahead. They watch over their crops very carefully, especially guarding against the insect pests that often ruin entire crops.  During harvest, she takes all of the prudiction and transports it to the wholesalers in town, who offer regular prices for the quality of her natural products. Since she is a very enterprising woman, in the future she plans to buy some heads of cattle in order to raise them and sell their milk. She also wants to finish building her house. This is the eleventh loan that she has with MFP and she promises to make all the payments on time because she is very grateful to the people who made this loan possible which will allow her to continue working and looking to progress. She is also very satisfied with the work in her community group because it is made up of people who are very supportive and responsible. She plans on investing the loan she has asked for in buying organic and chemical fertilizers. A portion of it will also be used to pay for the work of the laborers whom she has hired to help in the planting. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":590473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer and pay for the laborers who help in the planting.

He remembers one of his first projects as an electrician: on stage for jazz pianist Herbie Hancock. \"He was using a lot of synthesizers and microphones, so it wasn't an easy job.\" Willis keeps a photo of Mr. Hancock hanging in his office in Oakland, California.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, after working as a union electrician with large companies for 34 years, Willis decided to open his own business: Special Electric Construction. He wanted the freedom to take on the projects he is most passionate about: industrial and public works, such as bridges, schools and public buildings. He also wanted to have more control over the decisions that are made around purchasing and managing project budgets. \"I've seen so much waste in 34 years,\" he said.\r\n \r\nAs the son of a general contractor, Willis is proud to own a professional electrician business. \u201cThere are very few \u2018mom-and-pop\u2019 shops left,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of the competition from larger players.\u201d As a minority-owned business and a certified Small and Local Business, Willis's shop fulfills an important niche in the Bay Area.\r\n \r\nWillis\u2019s biggest challenge so far has been finding a line of credit to support the upfront costs of larger projects. He sought a small business loan from his bank but, despite being a home-owner and successful businessman, he couldn\u2019t qualify for a loan because he had never borrowed on credit cards and usually avoids taking on debt. When he saw Opportunity Fund\u2019s small business loan program featured on the local news, he decided to apply.\r\n \r\nWith a $5,000 loan, his first from Opportunity Fund, Willis will purchase and install exhaust fans in a building he is working on in Oakland. The loan will act as the line of credit he needs to purchase these costly items before his clients pay him for the job. In addition, this loan will ensure that he is able to start establishing a credit history for his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3672.17,"image":{"id":590509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"To

Tambogrande is in the province of Piura, in the region of the same name, and some three hours from Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nLuis has operated a business raising and selling sheep for two years.  He raises the animals behind his house and, when they are ready for market, sells them to neighbors and the buyers who occasionally travel through the area.  With earnings from the business, he supports himself and helps with family expenses.  \r\n\r\nLuis wants to buy more animals to expand his business.  He is applying for a 1,500 new-soles loan from Edpyme Alternativa so that he can meet his goal.  \r\n\r\nLuis is a reserved, hard-working young man and largely independent.  His greatest hope is to grow his business so that he can provide his family with the best possible quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":590522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy animals for livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-28T12:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Ernan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":103.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":106.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":111.79},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":111.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":121.3},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":125.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":132.39},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":139.51},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":143.7},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":147.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.48},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.91,"local_amount":103.38,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832999,"comment":null},{"amount":39.16,"local_amount":106.82,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":109.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099605,"comment":null},{"amount":40.99,"local_amount":111.79,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":114.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554990,"comment":null},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":111.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":114.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530378,"comment":null},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":121.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":124.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666505,"comment":null},{"amount":44.69,"local_amount":121.89,"processed_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":125.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409829,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":125.06,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":128.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108262,"comment":null},{"amount":256.01,"local_amount":698.2,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":716.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270397,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-28T15:01:53Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226428,"name":"Mario Anibal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cUNIDOS PARA EL TRIUNFO\u201d; este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nEl  socio es el  Sr. Mario; el tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad y es soltero y el socio se dedica a prestar servicio de seguridad, el socio tambi\u00e9n tiene su negocio familiar de fabricaci\u00f3n y venta de velas.

They work together to meet all of their goals.  Every day is new in the life of this tenacious youth, who works his mother's lands with a lot of care.  When he was young he helped her, but for some time he has done the work on his own.  He says that working in the fields requires a lot of dedication, as each day he must get up very early to plow and irrigate the land to keep it in good condition.  He loves his work, and he does it very well.  What he doesn't like is having to hire workers during the harvest season to carry the heavy sacks of his produce, but he says that he pays them well, since the earnings that he obtains allow him to live comfortably with his mother.  As he is very enterprising, he has plans for the future to buy some sheep, since he wants to increase his quantity of animals and start selling their meat.  This is the 11th loan that he has taken with MF, and he pledges to make his payments on time since he wants to continue working with the organization.  In addition, he says that he enjoys working with his communal bank, since it is made up of people who are very responsible and cooperative.  He plans to use the money requested to invest in the purchase of fertilizers that he needs to improve the productivity of his cultivations; in this way he can obtain better earnings.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":590539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer to improve the productivity of his lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilton ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588558,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T05:46:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226434,"name":"Blanca Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Blanca de 21 a\u00f1os, vive en el suburbio de Guayaquil, ella confecciona ropa desde hace a\u00f1os, su esposo es polic\u00eda retirado ellos tiene tres hijos. \n\nComenzando con una maquina de coser vieja pudo tener suficientes clientes para solventar sus gastos.

They live in the Valle de los Incas sector in the Tambogrande district.  It is an agricultural area primarily known for growing fruits like mangos and lemons.  It belongs to the Piura province, which is in the region of the same name.  It is three hours from the city of Chiclayo, which is the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nFor over a year she has been selling basic needs products and groceries in a store, which is in her house.  She offers her customers all types of daily consumption products.  Her customers generally do not have quick access to these products because of their geographic location.  They are quite a few kilometers from the nearest town.  With the money she gets from this activity she helps her husband, a farmer, with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nJesus works hard everyday to get ahead with her business.  In order to do that, she always tries to offer her customers quality products and good service.  She currently wishes to expand her business by purchasing more products.  That way she will be able to increase her sales, and then her earnings will increase.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve her objective, she believes it is advisable to request, for the first time, a loan for 600 soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nJesus is an enterprising woman who is very devoted to her family.  Her greatest desire is to keep working in order to help her family obtain a better quality of life.

She had five children, each of whom now lives in their own home.  She has custody of two of her grandchildren, Roxana Yassiri, who is eight years old, and Axel T., who is six years old.\r\n\r\n  She is dedicated to her home and to her grocer's shop (Kendra), which she has had for three years, showing that the business has been successful since it opened.  In her small grocery she sells beans, sugar and oil, among other products.  Her grocery is what has helped her to cover her household expenses. \r\n\r\n  Since she didn't have anyone else to support her, Magdai's children motivated her to open the business by giving her the start-up money.  They wanted her to be able to support herself and to get ahead.  With this work, she has been able to do just that.\r\n\r\n  With the profits that she earns from her grocer's shop, she purchases additional merchandise to re-stock the store.  Her store always has a professional presentation, and her customers feel well cared for by her.  Her store is very popular and preferred because she has a good spot in the community.\r\n\r\n    She says that her dream is for her business to continue to grow day by day so that she can save some money to start construction on a room for her granddaughter.  She also wants to support her grandchildren in their education and, for as long as god grants her life, to keep giving them all her support.\r\n\r\n     Magdai became a member of the group through an invitation from her daughter, Se\u00f1ora Rosa Lidia, who is the group representative.  The group is named \"Girasol\" (Sunflower) because on the patio of their house there are lots of sunflower plants.\r\n\r\n The people who make up the Girsol group are the following: \r\n  Magdai S\u00e1nchez M.: she makes her living with a grocery business and requested the loan to purchase additional merchandise.\r\n  Yolanda E. Ju\u00e1rez: she makes her living selling tamales (a local dish) and requested the loan to purchase ingredients such as meat, dough, chili peppers and raisins, among other items.\r\n  Rosa Lidia Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez: she purchases chickens from ranches to re-sell in the same area.\r\n Ilse E. Ju\u00e1rez: she makes her living selling tamales (a local dish) and requested the loan to purchase ingredients such as guineo leaves (from a local plant), meat, dough, ancho chilies and raisins, among other items.\r\n Yareny T.

Libacao, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a furniture-making business. Her husband Peter, who is 54 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are aged between eight and 30. \r\n\r\nAndrea joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Andrea has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock of raw materials for making furniture so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Andrea is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Guimbal, Barangay Canamucan, Compostela, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and her buy and sell businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $188. Melody is now borrowing 17,000 PHP which she will use as additional working capital for her general store.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Melody aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Park Punta, Barangay Hilutungan, Bantayan, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband, Santos C., who is 39 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old. \r\n\r\nMercedes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercedes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $170, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future tuition fees and for daily expenses. Mercedes C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have four children who are between 15 years old to less than a year. \r\n\r\nDerlina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Derlina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $465, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more fish for her business so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business.

M. is a 52-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: a fruit-selling and general store, a pig fattening business and a farming business. She lives in Purok Mabinoligon, Barangay Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fruits\/general store, and in her pig fattening and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of about $210 a month. \r\n\r\nMedina is now borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Medina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Eliza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASK which was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Eliza is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be her second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP to buy more piglets so that she can continue to save for the future and send her children to school.

M. is from the village of Sto.

The main source of income for the business comes from providing specialty tailoring services to local community members. Lolita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2010, Lolita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lolita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI which she used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to again purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Lolita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her immediate family.\n\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a married woman who lives in Purok 4, Barangay Cabanbanan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and an agricultural business. Her husband, Rolando, who is 58 years old, works as a farmer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have ten children who are from 16 to 36 years old.\r\n\r\nFlorencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, Florencia is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future to enable her children to finish their studies in college.\r\n\r\nFlorencia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue in its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\" target=\"_blank\">NWTF lending team<\/a>

V. is from the village of Sta.

He has been engaged in his business for over eighteen years and earns approximately 40,000 PHP per harvest.\n\nIn 2010, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be his first from ASKI.\n\nDanilo plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-nine branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Jorgie is 38 years old and is married with three children of whom two are studying.\r\n\r\nJorgie joined ASHI in 2005 and, since that time, she has shown consistency in her performance as a member. Because of her very good performance, her family has benefited from the loans she received from ASHI. She was able to support her husband in their financial needs and they were able to start a business: the family was able to put up a store where they sell motorcycle spare parts and accessories and different brands of gear and motor oil.\r\n\r\nThis time, Jorgie is applying for another loan to fund her business. The demand is high in their location so she decided to apply for additional capital. With the loan, she will buy more oil products and motorcycle parts and will renovate and expand their store space to be more pleasing to their customers. Since they started this business, their profit has increased and, with this new loan, they are pretty sure they will gain more profit.\r\n\r\nThe couple\u2019s dream is to become entrepreneurs someday and live a better life. They also want their children to finish college and earn a degree. All of their dreams are slowly coming to life and they are very thankful there are institution like ASHI and Kiva helping less fortunate families like them to achieve their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":590683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy
