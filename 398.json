C. is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Polopangan, Toboso, Negros Occidental.  She is married and has one school-aged child.  To make a living, she operates a rice retailing business in the local community.  She has been engaged in this business for over eleven years and earns approximately $230 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Nenita joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from NWTF. She is now requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her 15th loan from NWTF.

Rosevilla is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosevilla is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosevilla owns and operates a specialized retail store selling different products such as rice, sugar, salt, canned goods, soap, some food for snacks, etc., in the local community. Rosevilla has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosevilla joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosevilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.\r\n\r\nRosevilla is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rosevilla from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n \r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of San Jose. He is 42 years old. Ronald is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Ronald raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Ronald has been engaged in his business for over 16 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ronald joined ASKI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ronald has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. \r\n\r\nRonald is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Ronald from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narcisa M. is from the village of Sta Isabel Norte. She is 42 years old. Narcisa is the group leader of a 21-member group taking out a loan from ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Narcisa M.' Group.\r\n\r\nNarcisa is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Narcisa owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Narcisa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Narcisa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Narcisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Narcisa is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Narcisa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":535281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional products to sell in her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

Boas hopes to eventually expand his business by opening a store to sell \u201cKente\u201d cloth and also establish a Kente store at Kumasi so he can make more sales.\r\n  \r\nBoas is the leader of the group named 'New Way'.  There are 14 members in this group.  The other group members operate retail businesses selling various items such as \u201cKente\u201d cloth, fish, rice, and other products.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":537648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase Kente cloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Mampong","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.066667 -1.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2010-05-11T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akosua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serwaa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akosua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adwoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaw ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":5700,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1425},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1006.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1006.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144776225,"comment":null},{"amount":1006.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151958624,"comment":null},{"amount":1006.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159697319,"comment":null},{"amount":1006.25,"local_amount":1425,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-05T08:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166911465,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-18T14:54:31Z","paid_date":"2010-10-05T08:28:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199616,"name":"Zahida Parveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahida Parveen is a wife of M.

J. is a 60-year-old woman living in the town of Pamito, Sagay City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling herbs and spices in the local community. Susan has been engaged in this business for more than 30 years and earns approximately PHP 8,000 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Susan joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Susan has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 19,000 from NWTF. Susan is now requesting a new loan of PHP 17,000, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the 17th loan Susan has taken out from NWTF.

began a web-based used\/new clothing company in 2008. In 2009 he took out his first Kiva micro-loan through ACCION USA. In only seven months since his first loan he has already increased his sales by 50%, opened up a storefront, and is now married.\r\n\r\nJoshua works full-time in his business and has been able to increase his income. He will continue doing online sales but would like to focus on his storefront and designing a new website.\r\n\r\nJoshua will be using his second micro-loan to purchase a new computer that will help him process orders more efficiently, and to purchase new inventory. \r\n\r\n\r\n About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":537592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

is 40 years old, married and has 2 children, 16 and 22 years old. One of the children is attending school. Jane is a farmer from the town of Kitale, in Western Kenya. She has been farming for 4 years and selling her milk to the local market. She also earns income from making and selling ballasts at the local market. Her main challenges are the diseases which are rampant in the area, causing regular deaths of poultry and dairy cows.\r\n\r\nJane recently completed her first loan for KES 30,000 from Juhudi Kilimo. She has requested this loan for KES 22,000 to start a poultry project and purchase an energy pack (solar panel, charger and a bulb).

Aida Luz D. says that the loans she has received have helped her to increase her income and help her children in their education and in what she can provide for them; this is why she is seeking a 3rd loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo of $750.  She will use it to buy wholesale merchandise like shoes, belts and purses and ingredients for her food sales business; this is particularly important this month with Mother's Day as it will be a month of high demand and she will be able to get discounts if she buys in larger quantities.\r\n\r\nHer constant challenge is the amount of competition she faces but daily she tries to improve her abilities to support herself through better quality and offering good prices and good customer service.

Long before opening his business he took part in training programs to learn how to make his investment projects viable.  Often he repeated micro entrepreneurial courses in order to really be clear on the information; all of this has made it possible for him to succeed in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nHe became aware of Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo through its customer service office in Bancoldex.

But these are things of the past; now he has very clear goals and work direction.  He wants to own a well-known store; this has been his life-long dream.  \r\nHis challenge, therefore, is not to waste efforts, to work at his business and reinvest all he can into it.\r\n\r\nHe lives with his wife and two children who are 13 and 18 years of age; they inspire him to continue forward in these changing times.  Because he is a great entrepreneur, conscious of business opportunities, who sells an assortment of catalogue merchandise, he urged his wife-a woman who has his admiration and support and is a mother to the entire community-to do the same.  Now she too generates additional income for her family and business with this new activity; both spouses sell lots of products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Before venturing into the farming business, Mary initially was a business woman selling vegetables and maize to the local market. Her main challenge in this business is the milk glut (excess milk) which causes the price of milk to go down, leading to unstable income.\r\n\r\nMary recently completed her third loan from Juhudi Kilimo for KES.30,000. She has now requested a loan from Juhudi for KES.40,000 to purchase a dairy cow. This loan will enable her to acquire a good dairy cow that will increase the production of milk, hence earn her more income. She hopes to use the excess income from this loan to build a better house.

He is 46 years old, married, and has two children, ages 17 and 7.  Both children go to school.  Francisco finished ninth grade and did not continue school because he was drafted into military service.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone other than his children.\r\n\r\nAfter demobilization, Francisco left Tete to go to Nampula, where he studied nursing.  Later, because of a job transfer, he went to Maputo, where he made his home.  For more than 17 years, he has worked as a nurse for the Ministry of Health.  He has no employees and has a salary of 3,600 meticais per month.  He uses this money for household expenses and sometimes saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nFrancisco has never had loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through a neighbor who incidentally is head of the block and is a customer of this institution.  This is Francisco's first loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy construction materials (zinc sheets, beams, cement, stone and other items) to continue building his shop.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he may take out other loans.  In the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish building his shop and start his own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

They live in the community of Las Vigas (The Beams) in the municipality of San Marcos.  The members are Elsa (who sells clothes), Emma (who sells groceries), Norma and Dora (buying and selling fruits and vegetables), Guillermina (purchase and sale of shoes), Santa C. (cheese making), Ifigenia and Josefina (buying and selling fish), Teresa (buying and selling chickens), and Mar\u00eda Elia (selling meals).\r\n\r\nEmma is the representative of the Las Hadas Group.  She is married, her husband is a teacher, and they have 3 children; Carina, who is 18 and studies at a preparatory school, Francisco who is 15 and attends preparatory, and Manuel, who is 6 and attends kindergarten. \r\n\r\nEmma sells groceries and hopes to advance her family, so that her children will have a better quality of life.  Her other activities include selling tamales, atole and empanadas on weekends.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is delighted to receive this loan because it gives her great satisfaction to restock her store.  Emma will buy rice, beans, sugar, and soft drinks to restock, since July is approaching and that is when prices for these products rise.  She wants to restock earlier, so that she can sell more.\r\n\r\nAll the group members are very grateful for the help offered by the Reality Foundation, and for the confidence it has in them.  And they hope to continue working with the loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":538242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"BUYING COOKING OIL, RICE, SUGAR, BEANS, AND SOFT DRINKS TO SELL","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Localidad de las VIgas, Mpio. de San Marcos.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-10T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efigenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1423.36,"local_amount":17763.56,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":17887.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715824,"comment":null},{"amount":520.2,"local_amount":6492.14,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6537.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899554,"comment":null},{"amount":870.18,"local_amount":10859.85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10935.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639900,"comment":null},{"amount":311.26,"local_amount":3884.45,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3911.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854182,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T17:32:09Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199745,"name":"Grace Nayianoi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace Nayianoi L. is 32 years old, married to Tonou L., and the mother of four school-going children.\r\n<br>For the last 14 years, Grace has been farming her own piece of land.

His youngest child is Florinda's, who is forty years old, and with whom he has had a relationship for two years.  This family lives together in a rented house in the city.  They also have their own home where the rest of the family lives.  \r\n\r\nHe loves the tranquility of the countryside the best, which is why he has grown corn, peas, olluco (a type of Peruvian potato), and potatoes, on own land, for thirty-five years.  He can also count on help from his wife who helps him during the harvest season.  Alongside this business, he works as a longshoreman earning 20.00 to 40.00 soles a day three times a year.  \r\n\r\nThe thing Dionisio likes least is bringing the products he has harvested to market. He doesn't earn much, not even enough to cover labor costs or make a return on his investment. One of his goals is to build a big house with several bedrooms in the city so he can rent them to students and tourists.  He would also like to start a business selling groceries.  This is why he would like to continue to plant with great effort and produce several sacks of potatoes.

They are farmers and her sons help her in the fieldwork while helping to support her economically as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems they face is drought and crop diseases; this is why they are seeking a loan to buy fertilizers, crop nutrients, and seeds to diversify their crops and avoid losses in their harvest.  Two weeks ago, Dorotea had a bad fall which made it impossible for her to do both her housework and the fieldwork.  With the support of her husband, they will manage the issues with their fields, but both of them are quite old so it is difficult for them to get control of the situation.  The investment in fertilizer for their land will help them to increase their production and sales; this will make things easier for them in terms of supporting themselves.

On the contrary, she is always thinking about reaching her goal, which is why she cares so much about doing things properly. She along with her husband has been in agriculture for 20 years, and she likes to grow peas and gladioli hoping to gain great financial returns. Irene loves to grow peas because they are in high demand at the markets, but she also likes to raise chickens and guinea pigs. What she does not like, however, is sporadic weather because it affects most of her crops, which is what happened last year. Luckily, she now has technical assistance to help her plantation. Her goal is to be able to finish building her house in the city so that she can set up her own beauty salon since her daughter is studying cosmetology. Nevertheless, she wants to continue growing greater quantities of gladioli for now. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is very enthusiastic about working with her communal bank in which she organizes the group as president of the board of directors.

Toward the Future) is a communal bank that was formed by a group of women who look every day to improve their household economy through daily work. The group is located in the Sinincay neighborhood where you can enjoy green and flowered  fields, the lush vegetation of the mountains, the rivers and brooks, the song of the birds, adobe and brick houses both traditional and modern. The people are known for their humility, work, respect for others, and friendliness toward visitors.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica C. lives in the neighborhood of Las Malvinas in the city of Cuenca. She is requesting her first loan, motivated by her aunt and her cousin to form part of this splendid group of women striving in life. She is 34 years old and has been separated from her husband for 12 years since he left the country to try and offer them a better future, but on arriving at his destination he forgot about his family. Their union had resulted in a daughter who is now 11 years old and studies in a school in the city. Monica does not have her own house so she lives in her parents' house.\r\n\r\nMonica works as a domestic servant and also works in her mother's bar. For the moment she is in charge since her parent has been sick. She works at the bar only weekends and  in her free time she works selling clothing which she has been doing for 3 months. With this loan she will buy pants, shirts, blouses, skirts, dresses, and other accessories for all family members in order to have a ready stock of items for her demanding clients.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to have her own house.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Rosa P. lives in the El Cruce de Sinincay area, is 44 years old, and is married. Her marriage has resulted in six children who are ages 27, 25, 22, 14, 13, and 4. Her oldest daughter is married and lives independently. Her second son works in Hidropaute and only comes to the house on weekends. He helps Rosa a little with the economy of the home. Her third son works and studies at the university. The 2 next children continue studying in high school. Her husband is a professional mason. Thanks to the sacrifice of the family they have been able to build their own house.\r\n\r\nRose had a stand where she butchered pigs and prepared rich dishes but a year and a half ago she got a gallbladder illness and had to give up that work. Now she works in the cafe of a high school where she has been for eight months.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the communal bank for 10 years, thanks to an invitation from her cousin. With previous loans she maintained her stand and with the new loan she will pay some debts acquired in her previous business that have accumulated.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to improve the state of her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva

She is 38 years old. Juanita is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJuanita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Juanita owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

The official name of this borrowing group is Jocelyn G.'s Group.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Jocelyn owns & operates a specialized retail store.

The official name of this borrowing group is Marcelina L. Group.\r\n\r\nMarcelina is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Marcelina owns & operates a general store.

She also learned that her 24-year-old husband who is a driver will still support her, even in her disappointments. Now, Joan and her husband have decided to use this loan she is requesting to start up a hog fattening business.\r\n\r\nHog fattening is a kind of business wherein, after four months of raising or fattening hogs, the hog will be sold to people in their village or in the market, either alive or slaughtered. The larger the volume of hogs being sold, the larger the profit. Therefore, Joan can put up a savings fund for her four children whose age range is from one to seven years old. Through this she hopes to support their education until they graduate from college, and hopefully they will have a better life in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":538480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

She became a member in 2005 and has been a model to the rest of the members in the ASHI center she has belonged to since then. In spite of poverty, Fe has been very productive and has been a very strong support to her husband\u2019s livelihood, which is fishing. Through the loan she received from ASHI, she has invested in a motorized fishing boat for her husband and son to manage. She has also been able to have her own \"sari-sari\" store business. At times, Fe and her daughter were the vendors of the fish her son and husband caught from the deepest parts of the ocean. Looking back at the times when her children had no families of their own yet and she was the one supporting their needs and education, her happiness is undeniable. She realized how each one of them cooperated and participated in improving their standard of living. \r\n\r\nPresently, the fishing business of Fe and her husband still goes on the same, as does her \"sari-sari\" store, where she sells foodstuffs, beverages and grocery items. Her two sons are also fishermen and their wives are helping them sell their fish. Aside from enjoying the beauty of the crystal clear water of the ocean that lies not more than 80 meters away from their house, Fe and her family also enjoy the opportunity of getting a loan through ASHI and growing their fishing and fish selling business. Since she has no more children depending on her, Fe wants to grow their fishing, \"sari-sari\" store and fish selling business to make its profit stable, to start a savings fund intended for the renovation of their house, and to help her grandchildren as well.

S., 38, is married and the mother of two children. She and her family live together in a ger (the Mongolian nomadic tent) in Hovd province, Mongolia. Tseepil operates a raw material trading business in her town. Her daughter, Amarbaysgalan, attends a local secondary school. Her son, Amarjargal, attends a local primary school. During the day, Tseepil operates her raw material trading business at a market called Han-Ord. She has been operating her business since 2004, and has steadily expanded it. \r\n\r\n<p>Tseepil purchases the raw materials every week and resells them for a profit. Raw material businesses require a large amount of working capital, therefore she cooperates with two other people who run the same type of business.

Regarding the lives of individuals, however, there is little information available. So, the only way to learn is to consider our own lives and look at the lives of the people surrounding us. The general economic state of each country is estimated from all these lives. \r\n\r\nOur heroes (these group members) represent the multiplicity of any population. N. is fifty-five years old. She is a widow. She and her husband were happy enough, as they were endowed with six children. Most of these children are grownups, and not only make their own living, but also actively support N. in her old age. \r\n\r\nHer eldest daughter is married and works in Afghanistan, on American military bases. Her second daughter is married and works in Russia. The other two daughters are working in the capital city of Bishkek. Two of her sons are living with her. The elder one works for the local municipality. The younger son is fifteen and goes to school.\r\n\r\nN. keeps a cow, and does some household work. Her sons help her in their free time. N. decided to apply for this loan to buy a refrigerator. \r\n\r\nN.\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nT. Esentaeva, 39, is married and has a twelve-year-old son. Her husband works in construction. T. is occupied with raising cattle, and intends to buy more calves to increase the total population. Therefore, this loan is very important to her. \r\n\r\nN. Imatova, 49, is a widow. She has a twenty-year-old son. He goes to college. N. is occupied with cattle breeding and this brings her a monthly income of about $110. N. needs this loan to purchase more cows or calves. She hopes that in the near future she will be able to buy her son a car. \r\n\r\nN. Otorov, 30, is the father of two little kids. His wife stays at home with the children. N. is the sole provider. He works as a taxi driver. N. hopes to obtain this loan because he is planning to purchase calves. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

P. Mambetalieva is the leader of this group. She is twenty-three, married, and has a four-year-old son. Her husband trades in spare parts for cars in a specialized market.\r\n\r\nP. does her best to help her husband support the family, selling women\u2019s clothes at retail prices. She has been doing this for the last two years and now her monthly income is around $200. P. has many plans regarding her occupation. She decided to apply for this loan because it would help her purchase new items of clothing (summer and fall) and thus expand her assortment. \r\n\r\nP.\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nN. Jyrnova, 42, is married and, together with her husband, they keep a household and raise cattle. Apart from trading in cattle they also sell milk and manage to earn about $190 a month. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a calf for feeding.\r\n\r\nT. Abduldayev, 24, is married and has a four-month-old daughter. His wife stays at home with the child. To provide for the family, T. manufactures furniture. He used to work in a factory but now has his own business. T. needs this loan to buy materials for making furniture. \r\n\r\nZ. Abduldayeva, 27, is married and has a son. Her husband is a welder. Z. cannot work now and stays at home with the child. Her husband\u2019s monthly income is around $205. She has applied for this loan to buy a calf for feeding and thus help her husband financially. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Loans that she has taken out through her membership in ASHI have equipped her to have her own business and income to augment the small and sporadic earnings of her husband who works as a laborer. Eventually, Evangeline\u2019s small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store has grown and has been able to acquire more customers from their neighborhood and even from other villages. Sari-sari means that various foodstuffs, beverages and an assortment of grocery items are sold in a small open room of their house. \r\n\r\nEvangeline is currently happy with the achievements of her business. However, its proceeds are still too small for her to set up a savings fund since almost everything her family needs for food, clothing, etc. are provided through this. Therefore, Evangeline is requesting a much larger loan so she can increase the inventory of her store and sustain its operation despite providing credit to her customers. Soon all four of her children will be in school with her eldest in college and her second eldest in high school. Through her business's profit, Evangeline hopes to support her children until they earn their own degree in college and have a better future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":727.5,"image":{"id":538606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She began this business 10 years ago when she separated from her husband. She was obligated to generate income to support her family in addition to what she received from her children's father, which led her to look for this alternative. In the new forest neighborhood of the Cartagena D. Indias city, where she lives the idea of having a business was born. A friend helped her come up with ideas for the best way to run a business. So, her sister lent her a small amount of capital to get started and she began with a catalogue. Today, in order to diversify her selection, she manages 10 catalogue businesses. Thanks to this business she was able to see her children move forward, and now, she is so excited to know that they are both professionals.\r\n\r\nNow she is asking for a second loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, to invest in the purchase of a new line of highly desirable leather purses for her commercial clients. Since she arrived at this organization, almost a year ago, she has had available cash to buy many affordable offerings, especially in new product lines, and been able to offer them at a better price to her customers, and obviously, generate more income for herself. Her big dream is to bring her daughter into the business to improve the lives of her children, whom her daughter raises and educates on her own, and this is precisely her biggest challenge; to have a large store and to generate a good business with her daughter. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva

C. was born in the Maputo province 30 years ago.

She has three children who range in age from four to 10. All of them are in school. She has been living in the Boane district of Maputo province for the last three years. Before that, she was in Matola, right next to Maputo city, where she trained for two years as a teacher. \r\n\r\nShe is currently teaching nine-year-old children from 7 a.m. till noon. She earns enough money to save a small amount every month, using a savings group she belongs to. She learned about our microlending organization, Hluvuku, and about Kiva through a friend who is also a client.\r\n\r\nMargarido has applied for a loan to buy cement and iron to improve her home. With the help of Kiva lenders, she dreams of finishing its construction and giving her family a good place to live.

(After the colonial period ended and Mozambique became independent, it was common for many citizens to go to learn a job in Cuba, the former USSR or East Germany.) He has worked at the same company for the last nine years. He works from 7.30 to 17.30 with a one-hour lunch break. He is able to provide for his family but not able to save anything because he needs his entire income to feed his family and continue building a house for them to live in.\r\n\r\nArmando is applying for a loan to buy cement, sand, stone and other construction materials for the partially-completed house he lives in with his family. He learned about the possibility of getting a loan from Kiva through his neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith that help, he dreams of finishing work on his house.

She wants to buy cement and iron and other materials to improve her house that she is bulding bit by bit. The previous loans were all for the same purpose.

He lives in the community of Palestina Alta, located in the beautiful jungle of Cuzco where they have their own home.  For Cirilo, nothing in this life is impossible, his strength has raised him up to get ahead.  He is always involved in his work, always proving that \u201cthere is always something to do.\u201d  This has turned him into a perseverant person worthy of admiration.  Apart from growing cacao and coffee, he also works for other people doing farm work, earning money when he is not busy with his work.  In this way he is able to have additional income for his family.  Generally he works on his own from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening but at times his family helps him.  Normally he sells his products in his community at market prices to help its economy.  His main hope is to increase his cacao and coffee plantings.  For this he needs to equip himself with more fields.  This will help increase his production and his earnings, with the goal of improving his quality of life.  This is his third loan with MFP which he is committed to pay on time and also wants to comply with his community bank because of the good path it is putting him on.  With the loan he is requesting, he will use it to give better treatment to his lands better, to apply fertilizer, and in this way he will be able to produce on a large scale.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":538756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizer to cultivate coffee and cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirilo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":568.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886405,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-14T13:54:54Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":199997,"name":"Germ\u00e1n David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Germ\u00e1n David M.

At the weekends Hugo works in his fields, while from Monday to Friday he drives a heavy-duty truck for a mining company.\r\n\r\nThanks to his wife\u2019s hard work, his fields produce a good crop of beans, corn, potatoes and peas. For the last twenty years she has tended these crops and at the same time has never neglected her household duties. \r\n\r\nHugo\u2019s greatest pleasure is picking the ripe beans which he then parboils with salt and enjoys them as if they were a true delicacy. His work as a farmer is profitable and he can cover the household costs with the money he earns. \r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to buy more land and increase production. With the profit he would run a grocery store out of his home.\r\n\r\nThis is Hugo\u2019s first loan with Kiva partner MFP. The members of his community bank have accepted him into their group. He promises to pay back the loan punctually so he doesn\u2019t let them down. Hugo has plans to use the money to buy peas to plant in the appropriate season; he will use any remaining money to buy materials to complete the construction of part of his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":538766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-11T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":152.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":158.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":163.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":169.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":175.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":180.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.26,"local_amount":152.7,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":162.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144752045,"comment":null},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":158.1,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":168.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934508,"comment":null},{"amount":61.38,"local_amount":163.68,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":174.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673279,"comment":null},{"amount":63.54,"local_amount":169.45,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":180.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887105,"comment":null},{"amount":65.79,"local_amount":175.43,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":187.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154119,"comment":null},{"amount":67.74,"local_amount":180.64,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":192.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-14T00:40:23Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200004,"name":"Germ\u00e1n Esmeraldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Germ\u00e1n Esmeraldo S.

Vive en la hermosa selva cusque\u00f1a, en la comunidad de Palestina Alta, donde tienen su casa propia. Constantina manifiesta que ha tenido una vida dif\u00edcil, comenz\u00f3 a ayudar a sus padres desde su adolescencia como agricultora. Por las ma\u00f1anas iba a su colegio, y por las tardes se dedica a la siembra, esa era su rutina diaria. Su madre estaba delicada de salud y su padre comercializaba sus productos de cacao, pero dentro de sus posibilidades le dieron a Constantina las comodidades b\u00e1sicas que necesitaba. Es por ello que Constantina se esforz\u00f3 duro y parejo para sacar adelante la producci\u00f3n de cacao que sus padres le dejaron, ahora junto a su esposo labraron la tierra, para darle mayor impulso a su producci\u00f3n y con el tiempo rindi\u00f3 sus primeros frutos y de buena calidad. Posteriormente su producto es vendido en los centros de acopio,  d\u00e1ndole buenos resultados econ\u00f3micos; no contentos con ello decidieron instalar una peque\u00f1a bodega con la finalidad de ampliar su econom\u00eda, por lo que ya van tres a\u00f1os de muchas satisfacciones personales y emocionales. Es as\u00ed que anhela ampliar su bodega, con el prop\u00f3sito de introducir nuevos productos para ofrecer.

She lives in the beautiful Cusco backcountry in the Palestina Alta community where they own their own home.  \r\n\r\nConstantina relates that her life has been difficult; as an adolescent she helped her parents with their farming chores.  In the morning she would attend school and in the afternoons she cared for the crops; this was her daily routine.\r\n\r\nHer mother was in poor health and her father was a cocoa bean merchant and they were able to provide Constantina with what comforts were within their meager means.  Because of this, Constantina has worked hard and fast to succeed with the cocoa bean production her parents left her.  Now, together with her husband, she works the land to produce higher yields and, in time, has had the first high quality fruits of her labor.\r\n\r\nOnce harvested, the product is sold to area consolidating centers yielding good profits.  Not satisfied with this, however, they decided to establish a small store with the goal in mind to improve their finances.  They have gotten much emotional and personal satisfaction from this for three years now.  \r\n\r\nConstantina would like to expand her store by introducing more merchandise into her inventory.
