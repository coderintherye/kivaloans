Abdumalikovna H. lives in the region of Vahdat. She is 38 years old, married and has five children. She has secondary education and has been selling women's and children's clothing on the local Vahdat market for the past 15 years. Kumrihon's husband is currently unemployed and this is why the retail business is the only source of income for her big family. Three of her children go to school. Kumrihon wants to purchase seasonal clothing and she needs the money so she decided to apply for a loan. By receiving a loan she will be able to fully support her family and satisfy the needs of the residents with quality merchandise. She plans to pay off the loan within 6 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0425\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430

was making a living by selling fish, but now he changed to selling fried soybeans.

Now Harun is running a business in selling fried soybeans. Although all of his children already got married, Harun still continues the business. Harun works together with his wife who helps him frying the soybeans. Harun delivers the fried soybeans to the kiosks of his customers. With the initial capital of Rp. 1,000,000, Harun could buy 200 kg of soybeans and he could finish selling them in a week. With limited capital, of course, he only earned limited profit which was only enough for his daily expenses. As now living expenses are increasing and the price of frying oil and fried beans is also increasing, his initial capital is no longer enough to buy the required materials. Fortunately, Dinari Foundation gave a loan to Harun so that he still can continue the business. Although the business is a little bit slump, he still can finish selling 200 kg of soybeans every week. He is sure he can still continue running the business as he expands his sales to Singaraja area.

Untungnya Yayasan Dinari memberikan pinjaman modal kepada Harun,sehingga ia tetap bisa menjalankan usaha ini. Walaupun keadaan agak sepi namun ia tetap mampu menjual 2 kwintal itu dalam setiap minggu semua ini dipengaruhi oleh meningkatnya harga kedelai dan juga minyak goreng ,namun Harun tetap yakin usahanya akan berjalan terus,terbukti kini penjualan sudah dilakukan sampai kewilayah Singaraja.

M. lives in Vahdat.

Her own children are still young,  they are in middle school.  So for the last 12 years Mayram has been selling  groceries. She has a stall at the local  Vahdat market. Locals  know that she always has fresh items.  She would like to expand her inventory  by adding new items. This is why she needs the loan. By expanding her business Mayram will improve the quality of life  of her family. She plans to repay the loan in 9 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430

H. lives in Vahdat. She is married and has 3 children. She has a community college degree. She does not have a job. She helps her husband provide for the family by selling milk. Shahlo has steady clients from whom she buys milk at low prices and then travels out of the area to re-sell it.  This is a profitable business.  Shahlo has her own cow, but the cow does not give any milk.  If she had a milk cow, her profits would nearly double and she would also be able to lower her prices. This would make the milk  she sells more affordable for the local people.  This is why she is seeking a loan of $1025 to buy a good dairy cow. She plans to repay her loan within 6 months. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430

She and her large family live in the town of Ad\u00e9ta, located about 150 kilometers from Lome, the capital of Togo. To be able to feed, clothe and pay for school expenses of her children, Massah sells food along the road going to Ad\u00e9ta. She specializes in Akpan, a traditional and refreshing food made from cornmeal that one must wet and mix with ice and sugar. This is Massah's first loan and she awaits the opportunity to purchase more corn and sugar to continue to make iced Akpan. She would also like to purchase flour and bread with this loan so as to diversify her production and to attract more customers. This will allow her to respond to the needs of her family and to improve their quality of life. <p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Massah E. est ag\u00e9e de 41 ans, mari\u00e9e de 5 enfants.

The other members are Mr. Ayao A., who is 26 years old and single, Mr. Koffi O. who is 30 years old and single and Mr. Innocent K. who is 28 years old and married. These diligent men make furniture, chairs and beds from woods such as teak and sell them in town. A job in the wood and furniture industry is a good one to have in Togo and the group Noviwowo has been a part of this artisan community for 3 years. They are entrepreneurs, responsible and conscientious of their customer's needs. They have already benefited from two previous loans and which they have paid back on a regular basis. They  are asking for a third loan to purchase more planks, rafters, saws and hammers so that they can continue with their work. With these purchases, they will be able to produce more furniture of high quality for their community and they will use the profits to meet the needs of their respective families. <p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nGroupement Noviwowo est une entreprise des menuisiers cr\u00e9\u00e9e par 4 hommes d\u2019Ad\u00e9ta, Togo, une ville situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 150 kilom\u00e8tres de la capitale.

had her first son at 25-years old.  Two year later, she had her second.  She always wanted to have a business, and this is why she never gave up the idea of being able to study something and starting a business.  Two years ago, when her sons were a little older, she made the decision to study cosmetology at a beauty school.  After some months, she fixed up a space in her home and opened a salon with the little money she had then.  Throughout two years, she worked hard to be able to finish constructing a location to move to.  Now she works in a bigger location that she has gradually implemented over the years and where, for six years, she has dedicated a space to her bookstore.  She invests what she receives from these two businesses into the higher education of her sons.  Luckily, her husband, who works in a mechanic shop, supports her in everything.  Today, Lucy's objective is to continue growing her salon and to sell cosmetic products wholesale in the future.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nA los veinticinco a\u00f1os Lucy tuvo a su primer hijo, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s tuvo al segundo.

Nevertheless, she is now willing to continue until she finishes, and this is her main motive for turning to Ceprodel:  to obtain credits that will allow her to acquire the construction materials for her home.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nRuth Amalia es una joven madre originaria del municipio de Somotillo el cual se dedica al negocio de la venta de ropa con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de terminar de reconstruir su casa de habitaci\u00f3n que ha sido lastimada desde hace mucho tiempo por los fen\u00f3menos naturales.

Her mother is a teacher, and she also tries to help out her family a little.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe is high-spirited and wishes to improve her conditions, and she also conducts jewelry sales to help with the home improvement plans. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDavinia Aracelly es una joven de 27 a\u00f1os, trabaja en el Complejo Judicial, est\u00e1 solicitando su primer cr\u00e9dito para realizar mejoras a su vivienda en el Residencial Bosques de Juigalpan, como es poner el piso y techo a una ampliacion que esta realizando, no tiene hijos, es soltera y muy conocida en esta ciudad. \r\n\r\nDebido al salario que devenga mensualmente necesita apoyar se con un cr\u00e9dito debido a que los materiales estan sumamente caros, su mam\u00e1 es profesora y ella ayuda un poco a su familia.\r\n\r\nEs abogada con alto estpiritu de superacion, ademas de su trabajo en el complejo realiza otra activiad: venta de joyas, para ayudarse en la ampliacion de su casa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":151429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","use":"Install brick in the interior of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chontales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.083333 -85.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-04-15T20:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davinia Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-30T16:12:58Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":1676.19,"processed_date":"2008-05-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223678,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":1676.19,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253340,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":1676.19,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281710,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":1676.19,"processed_date":"2008-08-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-30T13:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311562,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":1676.19,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":343076,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85,"local_amount":1619.05,"processed_date":"2008-10-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-31T07:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1640.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373898,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-04-16T16:12:58Z","paid_date":"2008-10-31T07:04:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
