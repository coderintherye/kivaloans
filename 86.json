Her younger brother who lives with her and whom she supports, is working at the food stand during the day. They make from MTn 100 to MTn 1,500 per day at the stand, depending on the season.

She has always had the goal of getting out of her initially precarious situation.  She is succeeding with the support of her husband and financial help from her parents in getting settled in her food selling business, which has experienced appreciable change.  A very ambitious individual, she made contact with Alid\u00e9 and is benefiting from a loan that she renewed twice.  These days, her working capital went from 200,000 francs to 800,000 francs [$500 to $2,000 USD];  her booth, which was constructed of fragile materials in the beginning, has become an actual bar--restaurant, where customers benefit from the comfort.  Ms. A. helps her husband a lot at home.  With her profits, she has created two other sales outlets and has acquired a parcel of land.  She was born around 1975 in Bonou in the wealthy county of Oueme.  Married, she is the mother of three children, one of whom is in school.

Andrew O. (standing second left with clinic staff) is a general practitioner managing his own private facility in Kisumu, Kenya.  He is 44 years old and lives with his wife and six school-aged children.  He was employed by the government for the first three years of his career.  He then worked at a private hospital for six years before starting his own practice in 1997.  He ran his current facility on a part-time basis using it primarily for admissions, while his main practice remained in the center of town.  He gradually focused his efforts on building a larger out-patient facility at this location and eventually shifted his client base here three and a half years ago.  Besides general curative services and an observation ward, his facility offers a pharmacy, a laboratory and maternal and child health services.  Dr. O. attributes his success to hard work, perseverance and assistance from KMET\u2019s\/KIVA's previous three microfinance loans.  He has been able to expand his facility, increase the number of services he offers and improve the quality of care he provides.  Dr. O. also carries a very good reputation from his many years of good work in Kisumu.  His practice continues to grow as he attracts more corporate clients as well as private patients.  Dr O. plans to purchase additional of drugs in bulk with US $1200 he has applied for.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

In 2006 she moved her business location to Kisumu to join her husband who works in Kisumu.

They manage a line of credit of from 300, 000 guaranies (Paraguayan currency) to 800,000 guaranies per member.

Because of this alarming situation, Cynthia saw the need to work for herself. This is how she began her shoe sale business, first selling her products from home because she could not leave her house; her child was too young. Now that her son is older, she has changed her sales strategy; she goes door-to-door offering her products and rotating her merchandise. <p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan of $300.00 USD, which she is willing to repay in 6 months, so that she can purchase more merchandise that has been requested and order more products for the new season.

This name is right on the mark since the group was unanimously happy upon meeting each other. They also say they are always happy because Pro-Mujer offers them a huge help with the services they grant to their members. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the help of the service consultant, Sonia Aguayo Zeballos, they have been able to make a very well organized group. The group includes several small businesses, such as stores. Others are street vendors that sell artisan chocolates and crafts. The majority of them sell clothing they bring from the Desaguedero where prices are better. Therefore, they need to invest more capital to make trips to Desaguedero or other places where wholesale goods are sold. In this manner, the merchandise acquired will result in greater profits to be reinvested in expanding their businesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMoreover, they need to increase their incomes to support their families. Do\u00f1a Lupe's husband has passed away, and she needs to take care of her family. She and her four children are trying to improve their economic situation despite the difficult times they are going through. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is the association\u2019s 3rd cycle, and they hope to keep counting on these or larger loans so that they, too, can grow. <p>\r\n<b>Translated by Joanne Egnatchik, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEN LA ZONA DE VILLA EXALTACION FUNCINA EN CENTRO FOCAL DEL MISMO NOMBRE QUE PRETENECE A PRO-MUJER SE ENCUENTRA LA ASOCIACION DENOMINADA \"SIEMPRE ALEGRES\" DENOMINACION MUY ACERTADA YA QUE EL GRUPO  MOSTRO UNA ALEGRIA GENERAL AL CONOCERLOS.

Karena penghasilan suami sebagai petani yang tidak menentu. Keuntungan yang sudah dirasakan sangat memuaskan.dalam 6 bulan 7 bibit babi ini bisa menghasilkan Rp.3.500.000,- bersih. Keuntungan ini digunakan untuk biaya sekolah anaknya dan sangat menunjang kehidupannya.Untuk kedepannya Hudiani akan membuat kandang yang permanen agar babi yang dipelihara semakin

Sutarmi semangat untuk berusaha agar bisa membantu dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Sutarmi memelihara 4 ekor babi penggemukan yang dibeli dari saudaranya. Usaha ini sangat cocok untuk Sutarmi karena Sutarmi hanya tamat SD. Babi yang dipelihara sangat gemuk, karena dalam 1 hari Sutarmi memberi makan 3 kali. Juga diberikan makanan tambahan berupa dedaunan dan batang pisang. Setiap pagi, babi peliharaannya dirawat dengan cara kandangnya dibersihkan dan juga babinya dimandikan agar segar dan sehat. Keuntungan yang didapat dalam 6 bulan Rp.1.800.000,- Keuntungan ini digunakan untuk modal lagi agar bisa memelihara lebih banyak dan keuntungan juga lebih banyak diterima. Dengan dana pinjaman yang didapatnya, Sutarmi berencana untuk menambah populasi babi peliharaannya agar keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":144938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

Shomahmadovich A. lives in the Fayzabad region. He is 61 years old, married and has 8 children. He has a college education and is an agronomist by profession, but does not work in this field. He is in the animal husbandry business and breeds small cattle. He has five years experience in this field. He buys the cattle on the local market, feeds them for about 40-45 days and then resells on the same market at a more profitable price. This business is the only source of income for his large family. Islom wants to buy goats and needs the money so he decided to apply for a loan. At this time small cattle costs less to buy and prices will start to rise in about a month. He plans to pay off the loan within 9 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u0410\u0448\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0418\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043c

Toshkuvatovich D. lives in the Khuroson region in the Pahtaobod village. He is 51 years old, married and has six children. He has secondary education and has an animal husbandry business. He has a small cow house where he breeds calves. Because he does not have a specialized education, animal husbandry is the only source of income for his family. Assadullo buys calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells on the same market at a more profitable price. He provides the markets with meat and his family with the necessary food. Assadullo wants to buy a calf and needs money so he decided to apply for a loan. He plans to pay off the loan within 9 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u0414\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432

is 23 years old, originally from Ponta Mamone, a beach village in the South of Mozambique. He is married and has one 2-year-old child. Simiao lived with his sister in South Africa for 6 years where he went to school until 5th grade in primary school. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, Simiao returned to Zitundo, a village close to Ponta Mamone, to work at a camping lodge, where he learnt how to fish. He worked there for 5 years and in the beginning of 2008 he resigned to start his own fishing business. Simiao believes that he can earn more than the monthly R800 (approximately US$95) paid at the camping with his business, and so far it has been true. Simiao and his younger brother Ernesto go to the sea with his boat at 4am and return around 8am. They catch between 20 and 50 fishes per day, depending on the weather. Each Kg of fish (around 5-7 fishes) is sold for MTn 20 (approximately US$0.8). On top of supporting his wife and child, Simiao supports his brother Ernesto who also lives with them.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Simiao\u2019s first loan. He heard about Hluvuku through an older brother that is a client and has successfully paid his loan. Simiao plans to use the MTn 3,200 to buy a fishing net and improve his business. For now, Simiao wants to focus on growing the business and eventually to buy another boat.\r\n<p>\r\nThe picture shows Simiao selling his fish at Ponta D\u2019Ouro\u2019s open market.

Nazurov  lives in the town of Yavan. He is 53 years old, married and has five children. He has a college education and has graduated from a pedagogical university. He is a teacher by profession and works in a polytechnic college. In the rural areas most people are in the animal husbandry business. Iskhok also does that and breeds calves for meat sales. He wants to buy a few more calves and resell them after 2-3 months. He needs a loan for that and it will help him increase commodity circulation and also increase his family's income. He has been in this business for the past ten years. Besides money this business also brings joy to his family. He plans to pay off the loan within 9 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0418\u0441\u0445\u043e\u043a

M. lives in the town of Yavan.

She has one milk cow from which she gets milk and sells it on the market. This business brings good income to her. She wants to buy a second cow to increase the amount of milk she can get which will allow to increase her profits. Besides, milk is always in high demand and selling it helps supply the residents with a healthy and nutritious product at an affordable price. This is why Djumagul needs a loan.

K. is a 33-year-old married father of a one-year-old son. He has recently moved his family to Drobo, Ghana, from his hometown, where there wasn't any business opportunities. Felix has been a tailor for the past five years, and runs his store from a small wooden kiosk. He is currently training four people so they can support themselves as seamstresses. Here, he is pictured with two of his apprentices. <p>\r\n\r\nFelix has applied for a loan of $425 U.S. dollars to buy supplies, such as thread, buttons, and his own embroidery machine.

As a result of these challenges, she saw GHAPE as a source of relief where she enrolled herself in 2001. She has successfully managed and repaid loans up to six times.\r\n<p>\r\nGiven a new loan, she plans to buy piglets, fowl, groundnut and mixed farming. She will provide the community with planting groundnut seeds during this period of planting, which is one of the crops commonly grown in the North West.  Also, rearing of pigs will provide manure to farmers which help to increase agricultural output.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to pay her loan in 24months and her first installment of repayment will be done from the fourth month from date of  disbursement"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":145085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying of piglets and groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bafut, NW.

A majority of the members are married and have an average of five children.  Some, like Mrs. Malena, cannot count on any help from a partner\/spouse.  She was abandoned by her husband, leaving her as sole provider for their four minor children who do their best to help their mother while she works as a street vendor selling fruit.  There is a variety of activities within the group.  We were able to observe that commerce\/sales is the primary enterprise and the members sell clothes, in-season fruits, food, tableware, school supplies and other items.  Some offer their products at retail from fixed locations, and others work as street vendors.  It is certain that with additional capital they would be able to buy their merchandise at wholesale.

He came up with this idea after realizing that molasses was readily available due to availability of a sugar industry in his area and he could make use of this opportunity to create a molasses business for a living to support his family. He is the sole provider for his family and this business is the one that has supported his family for over 5 years now. He is married with 4 children.\r\n\r\nHis business location is in a suburb town within Kisumu city called Muhoroni. There is a sugar factory called Muhoroni Sugar Factory from which he gets his molasses. His business is unique in that there are few people in the area who thought of establishing a business like his. The interruptions that occurred to his business due to the post-election violence slightly affected his supply and necessitated a refinancing. This is the basis for the current loan that he is seeking.\r\n\r\nIn his group he has a leadership role as the group Chairman. His leadership style is unique in that in addition to being a strong leader, he has devoted part of his time to counseling the group members affected by the post-election violence as a way of ensuring that the group business activities pick up faster. This has endeared him to his group members who view him as a servant leader who is both concerned about their businesses and their social needs. His group leadership qualities have thus ensured that his group is among the most united in the region. Another unique feature of the group that has led to their current cohesion is his highly participative type of leadership which has encouraged members to voice their opinions openly without fear of victimization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Kiva is working with OI-WEDCO to refinance businesses disrupted by Kenya's post-election violence.  The group above has received loans from OI-WEDCO in the past and is now working to rebuild their businesses and to get back on their feet.Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

Fernando is 56 years old and is originally from Xilembene, in the Gaza Province. He is single and father of 2 daughters (25 years old and 11 years old) who live in South Africa with an uncle, as their mother died a couple of years ago. <P>\r\n\r\nFernando lived in the capital Maputo most of his life, completing primary school and working as a government employee for the FRELIMO Political Party. When he retired 3 years ago, he decided to open a bar in Ponta D\u2019Ouro, a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. <P>\r\n\r\nThe bar is located near the village\u2019s central open-air market and serves only Mozambican national brands. A glass of beer costs MTn 50 (US$ 2) and a bottle of rum, his most-sold product, costs MTn 150 (US$ 6). Fernando loves his bar and to serve clients. He has become quite close to some of them, and together they recently started to sell T-shirts and hats with Fernando\u2019s brand name (\u201cFernando\u2019s Bar \u2013 Ponta D\u2019Ouro\u201d). These customers produce the clothing in South Africa and bring it to Ponta for him to sell at the bar; the profit is split 50\/50. A T-shirt is sold for MTn 350 (US$ 14) and hats go for for MTn 50 (US$ 2). With the bar, Fernando makes from MTn 50,000 (about US$ 2000) up to MTn 200,000  (US$ 8200) per month, depending on the season and South African holidays, and with the sale of clothes he is making up to MTn 100,000 (US$ 4100) per month, and he is incredibly satisfied about it. <P>\r\n\r\nOn top of supporting his daughters, Fernando also helps 3 sisters and his mother who live in Zipeto, near Maputo. He goes to Maputo around once a month to buy inventory for his bar and spends around MTn 5,000 (US$ 200) in food for his family (in total around 15 people). As he doesn\u2019t have a car, he goes with the minibus and pays MTn 300 (US$ 12.50) for  the round-trip ticket. <P>\r\n\r\nHluvuku is part of Fernando\u2019s life. He has already had 5 loans that he used in the bar (for expansion and increase of inventory), the first one in August 2005 of MTn 6,000 (US$ 250). This sixth loan of MTn 30,000 (US$ 1200) will also be used to increase inventory and prepare for South African holidays in April. In the future, Fernando plans ask for a leasing loan to buy a good car to help him buy merchandise and sell his signature clothing at close beaches. He also dreams of building a small house in Ponta (he currently lives in the back of the bar) and a kitchen in the bar to sell food to his clients. With his motivation, charisma and will to grow his business, he is definitely going to succeed in

Fernando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azarias is 31 years old and is originally from Inhambane. His parents died when he was very young, so he moved with his 3 brothers to Maputo, where he went to school until 5th grade. He is married and has 4 children: the 2 oldest girls (11 and 8 years old) already go to school.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 1998 Azarias started working at \u201cPadaria do Papa\u201d, a bakery shop in Maputo, where he learnt how to bake bread. In 2002 he decided to open his own bakery shop, but Maputo would be very competitive, so he moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro, where wood was very accessible. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans.<P>\r\n\r\nAzarias worked in construction to save money to build his own oven, and in 2003 he had already started to bake bread. He bakes between 300 to 560 loaves of bread per day, depending on the season. Each loaf is sold for MTn 3.5 (around US$0.15) and they sell out very fast, as Azarias is one of the best bakers in the region (he sells to the most famous hotels and restaurants in Ponta D\u2019Ouro). A sack of 10 kilograms of wheat costs around MTn 200 (about US$ 8) and is enough to make 85 loaves of bread. His oven has the capacity to bake up to 100 loaves at once, so Azarias starts very early in the morning in order to finish baking by 6-7am. Azarias makes approximately MTn 7,500 (US$ 310) per month, and after paying expenses, including his 2 employees and the lady who helps with the house, his profit is around MTn 2,000 (US$ 83).<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Azarias\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku. The first two he used to buy raw materials (wheat, salt ,and yeast). This time Azarias plans to use his loan of US$ 350 to finish building a grocery store near the oven (which is inside his yard \u2013 near his house), where he plans to sell other food products. Azarias believes that he can even start buying some inventory with this loan. The lady who works at his house will work at the grocery store, and his wife will take care of the house.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Azarias would like to have a fourth loan to build another house on his land to increase his income through rent. In Ponta D\u2019Ouro many people come to work during the season and rent rooms, and Azarias believes this would be a good business venture.

He is married and has 4 children. He went to school in Inhambane until 5th grade (in two more years he would have finished primary school) and in 1995 moved to Swaziland to live and work with his father.<P>\r\n\r\nIn Swaziland, his father had been working in a lodge since 1989 and his boss employed Narcisio as well. After gaining his boss\u2019s trust, Narcisio was sent in 1997 to Ponta D\u2019Ouro in Mozambique to look after 3 rental houses that the boss had there. Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans.\r\n<P>\r\nNarcisio looks after the houses, helps manage all the employees who work there, and does any repair that is needed. He earns R1600 per month (around US$ 200) and is able to save a bit from time to time. His wife Angelica also works in one of the houses as a cleaning lady and earns R600 (about US$ 70) monthly. Narcisio and Angelica live in a room in the back of one of the houses, mainly because Narcisio is also in charge of security. Their children sleep in a house Narcisio is building, but spend most part of the day with them.<P>\r\n\r\nNarcisio first approached Hluvuku in 2000 asking for a loan to start a grocery stand. As the value requested was denied, Narcisio decided to postpone the idea. In 2005 he bought a piece of land and decided to start building a house, so he asked again for a loan to buy construction material, which was approved. This is Narcisio\u2019s third loan and will still be used to buy construction material. The house is almost ready; this time he will buy some missing windows and doors. Before borrowing though Hluvuku, Narcisio used to ask his boss to lend him money, but the boss would make him pay at once, normally deducting from his salary, and that was too much for him. Hluvuku in his opinion is very good because he repays an amount he can afford every month and still has money to support his family.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Narcisio intends to ask for a new loan to keep improving the house and once it is ready, he hopes to start building 2 others, as he already has other land close to his house. He dreams about giving each of his children a house to live in. <P>\r\n\r\nThe picture shows Narcisio with his 9-year-old daughter

In 1992, TYM Fund of the Vietnamese Women Union came to Minh Phu town to put their microeconomic programs to help Vietnamese women into trials. With 20USD borrowed money, Mrs. T. invested in breeding pigs. Even though she did not earn a lot of profit at first, she realized the convenience in being able to repay weekly and she also appreciated the knowledge she learned from their meetings. She continued to be a member of the Fund and borrowed more more money. Her family situation got better over time and she was able to send her children to school. Her oldest child is now the Director of a software company. Because of the current trend, together with the help of her oldest child, she invested in opening an Internet caf\u00e9. Mrs. T. had lots of customers, especially young people. Her current income is 220-250 USD\/ month. In the future, she wants to expand her Internet caf\u00e9 to serve more customers. This time she intends to borrow 1200 USD to buy more computers \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb T., 46 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 1 trong s\u1ed1 20 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean \u0111\u00e3 \u0111i v\u00e0o l\u1ecbch s\u1eed c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

When the TYM Fund came to her village in 1992, she participated in the program and borrowed 30 USD to invest in breeding pigs. In the first year, her family situation experienced positive changes. Since then, she borrowed more money to expand her breeding plan. Her income from breeding pigs increased over years and as a result, she was able to send her children to school. Currently, her family income is 330 USD\/month. Because of her successful business, in 2004, Mrs. N. was able to have her own well-furnished house built. During recent years, she always borrow the maximum allowed money. Her plan is to borrow 1200 USD to buy more pigs, ducks, fishes and food for them.  \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ee3i, 46 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 2 con t\u1ea1i Minh Ph\u00fa, S\u00f3c S\u01a1n.
