is a hard-working person and over many years, this has allowed her to earn enough income to support her two children. She is devoted to raising animals, especially cows which she buys and sells in her local market. In this manner, she makes the income that she needs.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Helen A. and her husband live with their five children in a village close to the seashore of San Jose in the Province where mountains meet the sea - Antique. The livelihood of most people in this village is made by fishing and selling fish. Though Helen\u2019s husband is not one of those, she supports the sources of income of other families by financing a fisherman\u2019s needs for fishing. In return for the financial assistance she extends to a fisherman, she receives half of the profit he earns from his fishing. \r\n<p>\r\nIt was seven years ago that Helen started this kind of business. She started with a very small amount of money from the savings she was able to set aside from her husband\u2019s daily income from being a driver. In 2004, considering the growing needs of her children, especially in education, Helen wanted to grow her business to further augment her husband\u2019s income.  Her oldest child and second child will soon go to college, while the next two children will be in high school, and the youngest in elementary. Helen knew she had to have more income. \r\n<p>\r\nSince Helen was able to have access to credit by joining the Kiva field partner, ASHI, in 2004, she has been able to finance many fishermen in their village. Now she is requesting a larger loan to finance the fishing business of her brother-in-law. Once fish are sold wholesale to a market fish vendor, profit will be shared with her depending on how much has been agreed upon. She also sells some of her share of fish for more income and profit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":383090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To financing a

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The reason why Abduvali looks for support from IMON International is that he needs to purchase additional livestock in order to expand his business. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The 3 business activities helps support the needs of their young family and earns about PHP 6,500 a month.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use her 15th cycle loan amounting to PHP 29,000 as additional capital for her rice retailing business, the income of which she plans to pay for the school tuition of her children, set aside some amount for their future and invest the rest back into her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bashorat, a 44-year-old woman, is married with three children. Bashorat cultivates a small farm, which she has done for more than five years. She grows different types of vegetables and wheat. Everyday she gets up very early. At 5 am, she drives to the produce market in the capital to sell her products, while her husband and sons take care of the daily work on the farm. \r\n<p>\r\nBashorat is very proud of the work they've done together as a family, and grateful that they've been able to acquire the comforts they have in their home. They have made good use of loans, since nowadays it's very difficult to get ahead without the extra help. Bashorat has applied for a loan from IMON International for the first time. This loan will be used to buy fertilizer, seeds and insecticides that they need for their farm.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahmadjon is 43 years old man. He is married and has 3 children. Ahmadjon\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life to get ahead and to fulfill his goals. Ahmadjon is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Istaravshan city in search of customers. He has owned his business for 6 years. Today Ahmadjon is planning to replace the fuel supply system with one using the gas as a fuel change, as the gas is more cheaper than petrol. Also his car needs thorough repair and with this purpose he wants to borrow $ 1000 USD. He sincerely thanks Kiva and all lenders that make this help possible.     \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Edna is 44 years old, and although frustrated in her children, she is happily married to her husband Emelke L.. She is frustrated because, at their young ages, Michael and Liezel are already married. Michael did not finish his college courses, and Melanie got married right after high school graduation. Edna does not want that to happen again with her youngest child.\r\n<p>\r\nThe hardest part of it is that the families of her married children still count on her and her husband for financial support. The source of Edna and Emelke's income is their mini-general store, which never provides enough money for their big family. \r\n<p>\r\nEdna now wants to start a new business, which is hog fattening or the raising of pigs. She is sure that this business will provide more income, because it suits their place. They have a big backyard for the building of the piggery house. Before starting this business, she needs capital that she can use to buy the piglets and their feed, as well as for the construction of the piggery house. She joined the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), so that she can borrow capital to start her business. She is hoping that this business will provide their big family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is also really hoping that her youngest child will finish her studies and find a better future

The couple is blessed with four children who are: Nomelyn, 23 years old and a college graduate; Lizel, 20 years old and just finished her Hotel and Restaurant Management course; Moris, 17 years old and a high school graduate; and Fedelito S., Jr., 15 years old and currently a high school student. \r\n\r\nFedelito works at his repair business and sometimes also works on his man made stoves, made out of cement and recycled stove materials, which makes a good kind of cooking stove. Fedelito wanted a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to maintain his business and become successful someday.  He hopes to get a loan of PHP6,000 that will be utilized for the development of his repair and manufacturing business and ultimately for the welfare of his beloved family.

Bella Arbaquez of Barangay Calumangan in Barrio Site, Bago City, Negros Occidental, is a 52-year-old wife and the mother of two children, who is concerned about her family's future. This is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nWhen she and her husband considered starting a business, his skills and knowledge in electronics made them decide to offer electronic repair services to the townspeople of Bago. The only difficulty they had was that they needed capital to start the business so that they could buy the necessary equipment and tools and have working capital. Joining NWTF-Project Dungganon solved this problem for the couple.\r\n\r\nWith the business up and running, both Bella and her husband work as partners in running the business, and the arrangement has worked well for their family. It has made them more united, and the business is doing well, earning about PHP 30,000 per month, which provides well for their family's needs, and allows them to set aside some money for the future security of their children.\r\n\r\nThis is Bella's 14th loan from NWTF. She wants to borrow PHP 19,000 to buy more equipment and tools for their business and also add to their working capital.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Mildred B., a 28-year-old married woman and the mother of one, is a resident of Prk. Balunggay, Palaka Norte, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She says that putting up a business was not easy \u2013 especially when they had virtually no money to start it \u2013 but she had an intense desire to have her own business and help her husband support their young family. Mildred joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could have access to start-up capital, even if it was just a small amount. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the help and support of NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mildred started a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (general store) where she sells a variety of household commodities. She has slowly expanded her product offerings with subsequent loans, by re-investing some of her profits back into her business. Now, in the addition to the usual stuff sold in <i>sari-sari<\/i> stores, Mildred also sells frozen food, Ready-to-Wear dresses and offers an electronic loading service for pre-paid mobile phones to her neighbors. This earns her an average income of PHP 18,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nMildred plans to use her tenth loan cycle of  20,000 PHP to expand the product offerings in her <i>sari-sari<\/i> even further, so that with the profits, she can finally make some improvements to her home.   \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of  \u2013 not just of a few \u2013 but thousands of women.

to Mrs. Chinita C., a resident of Sitio Magtalisay, Barangay Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental, it is very hard to raise seven children if you rely solely on just one source of income. With such a large family, it was almost impossible for them to live on just what her husband earned as a fisherman. Many times, her husbands catch was too small to cover even the most basic needs of the family, such as food for the day, much less provide for the education of her children, medicine for when a family member gets sick, and other expenses. \r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and went into the fish-selling business to supplement her husband's income and make her children's future more secure, because she knew that if she did not take the initiative, her children's future would be in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nSo, armed with her first loan from NWTF, she started selling her husband's catch, bought fish from some of the other fishermen, and sold them around the neighborhood and around the town for the next 10 years. This business enables her to earn an additional PHP 3,000 for her family.\r\n\r\nNow she hopes to expand her business by using her 9th loan of Php 15,000 as additional capital so that she can buy a bigger volume of fish from the local fishermen to sell to her growing number of loyal clients. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Four of the women are married, and one is a single mother.  All of the members work in commerce, the predominant economic activity in this region.  Each one of them sells different products as street vendors in the same community or in the outskirts of Collantes.\r\n\r\nMaria Teresa Martiniez sells fresh pork.  Maribel Dom\u00ednguez M. sells clothes and perfume.  Emiliana Velasco D. sells sweets inside of an elementary school.  Her husband grows papaya.  When they collect the harvest she helps to sell papaya, which is approximately every six months.  Cira Lidia D. S. buys and sells fresh fish.  Ana Maria Dom\u00ednguez S. sells fresh, butchered chicken.\r\n\r\nOn the average, they have spent 15 years doing these activities.  They decided to work to economically help their husbands.  Their salaries for sometimes working in the fields do not cover the family\u2019s necessary expenses.  This is especially true when they have another person to take care of like a grandchild or other relative to support such as in the case of Cira Lidia D. S., who is raising her granddaughter.\r\n\r\nMaribel D. M., the group\u2019s representative, found out about the micro loans with few requirements that Fundacion Realidad gives.  She got together with the other members.  They met the requirements and asked for a loan to help them buy the products that they sell like fresh pork, clothes and perfume, sweets, fresh fish, and fresh butchered chicken.  The loan will also help with the expenses generated when they have to makes their purchases and travel to the city of Pinotepa Nacional or El Puerto de Acapulco, Guerrero.\r\n\r\nThese clients say that they feel satisfied with the support from the loan given by the Fundacion Realidad.  When they started their businesses a while ago, they did not have access to a loan because they did not meet the requirements of the banks.  They hope that the institution does not stop offering this type of service.  They hope that, cycle to cycle, its investment will be larger each time.  Then the well being of their families, above all, the well being of the children, will be better each time.  If possible, some day each one will have an established place to sell their products.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":382726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy and sell products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-09-04T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cira Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87040237,"comment":null},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952636,"comment":null},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794794,"comment":null},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6513.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685954,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-10T23:38:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":134810,"name":"Warlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Warlita O. is a 53 year-old married woman who has 3 school-age children. She lives in Prk. Malipayon, Bago, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mrs. O. used to worry about the future of her children, because she knew that her husband's salary would not be enough to pay for their education and other needs.\r\n\r\nAfter she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she decided to make use of her cooking skills and set up a \"carinderia\" or luncheonette in which serves affordable home-cooked meals. Her place soon became a popular eating place for the locals, and for the next 5 years, her business gradually improved through her own efforts and with the help of her subsequent loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she always paid back on time. Her luncheonette now nets a monthly profit of approximately PHP 8,000, which is a big help to the family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWarlita is now borrowing her 15th loan from NWTF. She wants to borrow Php 19,000 to use as additional capital for her \"carinderia.\" The profits are already budgeted to be reinvested in her business after some have been set aside for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

has done what many people only dream of -- he has started working full-time combining two of his passions, kids and football! A former professional football player, Chris had the idea of organizing a kids' football league for many years. The idea came to him when he was coaching his youngest son's team. Chris has a good eye for football talent and wanted to help local kids. Finally, in 2008, he assembled of team of volunteers and went for it!\r\n\r\nOne of Chris's goals was to be able to provide opportunities for kids who were not able to join football leagues because of financial burden. In his first league, he put four teams together and involved his small community in Idaho by letting them sponsor those who couldn't pay to join the league themselves. Lately, his biggest challenge in tough economic times has been continuing to find funding to expand the league.\r\n\r\nBy googling \"minority business loan,\" Chris found out about ACCION USA on the Internet. In the past, he had used his personal credit card to pay for league-related expenses, which conveniently allowed him to access cash immediately, but had an interest rate that was unsustainable for larger loans. \r\n\r\nChris will use this loan to pay for new uniforms, which he says will help build team pride and attract more team members, and to pay for next season's league fees in advance at a discount. Chris hopes he can dedicate himself fully to coaching the team once the business grows to a point where it can sustain his family. He dreams of taking his team to the highest levels of minor league football, perhaps even entering the professional arena one day.

immigrated to the United States seven years ago and today he is a proud business owner. Three years ago when he felt unfilled in his retail job, Angel decided to open his own electronics business.  He started with very little capital, making it tough to grow his business at first.  When Angel looks back on his first year in business, he remembers the endless amount of work involved and is grateful for where his business is today. Angel\u2019s business has seen much growth and so has his family. He is married with two children ages two and six. Even though business is doing well, Angel explains that things are still tight, especially because of the current recession. No matter what, he says opening his own business was the right decision both personally and professionally.  Self-employment and serving his clients has given him a strong sense of honor while creating a legacy for his children.  Angel looks forward with determination as he grows a healthy business.\n\nAngel started his electronics wholesale business in May 2006, because he wanted to go into business for himself. To start his business, he used credit cards and a loan from family and friends, but he is happy to have found ACCION USA because they offer him credit that is much more affordable and dependable. \n\nHe says his greatest success has been importing electronics equipment from other countries, like China. He will use part of this loan to purchase 100 cell phones from China. It's important to increase his stock in cutting-edge items that his customers demand. One of his biggest challenges is keeping customers coming back because he has the highest quality electronics.\n                      \n

Perpetua P. is 53 years old, married and blessed with 5 children. Her family are residents of Tabao Baybay, Prk. Malipayon, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She dreams of providing a proper education for her children, supporting the family's needs and providing them with a better future. This is Mrs. P.'s main concern, because  she knows that if she relies only on her husband's income, all of her dreams would come to naught, because his income is just too small to sustain the needs of her fairly large family. \r\n\r\nBecause of her strong determination to fulfill her dreams, she thought of ways to earn more income. To have access to the much-needed capital to start her business, Perpetua joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, and started selling gasoline in her community. Their place is relatively far from the nearest gasoline station, and there is a demand for gasoline because of the many motorcycles and tricycles (motorcycle with a side-car for passengers) that ply the roads of their community. For 10 years, Perpetua has been fairly successful in this business and it earns her about PHP 4,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mrs. P.'s 14th loan from NWTF. She wants to borrow Php 20,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can expand her gasoline retailing business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She lives alone with her children, who take up a lot of her time since they are school age and need a lot of support and advice. They are the reason why she works at home as she felt this was best. However, it is not easy to work at home as she needs to dedicate a lot of time to make the clothing her customers order. Since she has a large volume of orders there are times when she cannot fulfill them and has to ask for help. In\u00e9s has been able to overcome these challenges because she realizes that through her hard work and dedication she will eventually have a larger manufacturing shop and will therefore be able to build a brighter future for her family.

She faces it all with a positive attitude and puts forth extra effort, since she knows that if she wants to get ahead, she has to work very hard in her business. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she has always been very punctual with all of her payments. With the funds she is requesting, she will buy a large inventory of beauty products so that she can keep them in stock, thus achieving higher sales by delivering the products immediately, rather than waiting to place catalog orders. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":383335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Expanding merchandise inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-04T23:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":290.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":317.6},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":330.74},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":341.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":353.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":366.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.37},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.66,"local_amount":290.45,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":298.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997464,"comment":null},{"amount":112.62,"local_amount":321.77,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":331.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842809,"comment":null},{"amount":330.08,"local_amount":943.1,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-22T09:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":970.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734386,"comment":null},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":77.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":80.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959603,"comment":null},{"amount":128.36,"local_amount":366.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":377.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992401,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T13:11:02Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":134872,"name":"Bertha Mariela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mariela es socia del Banco Comunal Se\u00f1or de los Milagros.\nMariela es soltera, tiene 22 a\u00f1os y 1 hija, Mariela vende ropa y calzados a pedido, sus productos los ofrece a amigos y familiares, adem\u00e1s Mariela trabaja en una instituci\u00f3n como personal administrativo.\nMariela necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de ropa.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Mariela son salir adelante junto a su hija y tener una tienda.\n","en":"Mariela is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cSe\u00f1or de los Milagros\u201d (Lord of Miracles).

This way her earnings will grow, and she will get more customers because she will have what it takes to cover their necessities.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":383411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T16:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9500,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96950160,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103792305,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683033,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077607,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913849,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949512,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678357,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712797,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152048141,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636700,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T01:09:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":134902,"name":"Claudia Araceli","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Claudia vive con su esposo el se\u00f1or Ram\u00f3n  en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus 2 hijos.\nSon una familia trabajadora y muy emprendedora, el trabaja para una empresa y la se\u00f1ora Claudia se dedica a la venta de quesos, como ingreso extra para el apoyo familiar, ella vende  quesos desde hace 3 a\u00f1os;

For this reason, she would like a loan of PHP 5,000 to be able to buy new sprockets and other parts needed for her tricycle. Evelinda and her husband are thankful because they are blessed with three children: Maria Erika, 10 years-old and in grade five, Roselyn Jade, 7 years-old and in grade two and Danilo Jr., who is 3 years-old.

Being an industrious mother, the three oldest children have already finished their college studies and have begun their chosen professions.  The youngest has not yet completed school.  Lydia is really proud of all of them.\r\n<p>\t\r\nHer husband cultivates their farm lot by planting rice and vegetables for two crops a year.  Lydia uses her time to manage their community based store and operate direct selling of AVON products in their village. She is asking for a loan of PHP 8,000 from Kiva lenders to provide additional capital for her store and direct selling business.  She hopes that lenders will provide her the loan in order to improve her livelihood and allow her to be of further help to her husband.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":383437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She wants to borrow additional business capital of PHP 8,000 from Kiva lenders for her to acquire her products like grocery items, soft drinks and frozen foods. Because of her interest in improving her store, Juanita is hoping that Kiva will somehow lend her the amount. That will be of big help towards the success of her business.\r\n\r\nJuanita also believes that, through her strong faith and determination, her business will grow and expand through the continued

into business for one's self is not an easy occupation - there is no safety net and no one to run to when things go wrong or when problems arise. This is what Mrs. Remedios J., a 52-year-old married woman from Central Tabao, Zone 4, Valladolid, Negros Occidental realized when she started her fish-vending and seafood processing business. But with five children to raise and educate, she knew that it was the only way if she wanted to provide them with a good education and a good future.\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. J. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, her need for additional capital for her business pushed her to deal with the moneylenders and their exorbitant interest rates. This situation piled more problems on her business because the high interest rate demanded by the moneylenders added more burden to the business. This is the reason why she is very thankful that she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. And because she values the service that NWTF-Project Dungganon is providing her, she makes sure that she pays back her loans on time.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. J. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, with the easy-payment scheme, she was able to sustain her business. With the help of the loans she borrowed over the years, most of the difficulties in her business were ironed out - even the problem of transporting the products to the market. Where, before, she had to pay a high price to rent a truck to make her deliveries, now she has her own truck and this is no longer a problem. She has also acquired a tricycle - a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers - which adds to her daily cash flow.\r\n\r\nMrs. J. is very grateful that her efforts are now starting to pay off, and three of her children are slowly settling into their own lives, after graduating from college. She is now about to use her 24th loan amounting to PHP 29,500 as additional capital for her seafood processing business, making \"tinabal\" (fish or shellfish in vinegar), \"guinamos\" (shrimp paste), and dried fish and for her food-vending business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":383552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To invest in expanding her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-06T13:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Remedios","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29500,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2269.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2269.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":18880,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":19440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088368,"comment":null},{"amount":176.92,"local_amount":8351,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":8598.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004116,"comment":null},{"amount":48.08,"local_amount":2269,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-06T18:45:43Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":134936,"name":"Jerisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jerisa B., a 49-year-old woman, is widowed  and has five children, all in school.

M. (0) is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Foaluga.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Asenati owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Asenati has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Asenati joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Asenati is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Asenati is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Asenati plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Kuka raises crops, mainly vegetables. Kuka has been in this business for over three years and earns approximately 400 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kuka (01025002-05) joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Kuka is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD. Her previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  \r\n\r\nKuka is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST. This loan will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be Kuka's third loan from SPBD. Kuka plans to use the additional revenue to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Mauata is requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide her service. This will be Mauata's first loan from SPBD.

T. is a 60-year-old woman living in the town of Saipipi.  She is married and has eight adult children.  Faleafine has a business in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Faleafine has been engaged in this business for over one year and earns approximately 300 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Faleafine joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Faleafine is requesting a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  The loan will be her first loan from SPBD.  Faleafine plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. (0) is a 35-year-old woman living in the town of Pitonuu.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Malama owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Malama has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Malama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malama is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Malama is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Malama plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M., a 59-year-old woman living in the town of Tafua Tai, is married and has eight adult children. To make a living, Saloaloa runs a general store selling a variety of different products in her community. Saloaloa has been in this business for over four years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saloaloa (0) joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD that was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering, Saloaloa is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST. This loan will be invested in expanding the business. It will be Saloaloa's third loan from SPBD. Saloaloa plans to save the additional revenue as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T. (0) is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Gataivai. She is married and has seven school-aged children.\n\nVaimalo owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. She has just started operating this business.\n\nIn 2009, Vaimalo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her first from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children\u2019s tuition fees.\n\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Fotu is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has eight grown children.  To make a living, Sophie owns and operates a business planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables to sell.  Sophie has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately $78 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sophie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities.  Sophie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Sophie is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used again to purchase manure.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Sophie plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

M. is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Salelologa.  She is married and has one school-aged child.  To make a living, Pueomanu owns and operates a business running a food stall.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community.  Pueomanu has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately $160 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pueomanu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Pueomanu is requesting her first loan from SPBD of 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand her business.  She plans to improve her business with the additional revenue that is generated. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. (0) is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has 7 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Iuni owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Iuni has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Iuni joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Iuni has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Iuni is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Iuni plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fotu is a 66-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has fourteen grown children.  To make a living, Sophie owns and operates a business running a food stall.  Her main source of income from the business comes from selling beef products in the local community.  Sophie has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately $160 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sophie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Sophie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Sophie is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will also be used to buy more products to sell.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Sophie plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T. is a 61-year-old woman living in the town of Faga.  She is married and has eight grown children.  To make a living, Ogesoo owns and operates a business raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting taro to sell.  Ogesoo has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately $160 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ogesoo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Ogesoo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Ogesoo is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Ogesoo plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Her sales have been going smoothly, and she plans to keep going forward and prosper with other businesses.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 1,000 PEN she will buy groceries like sacks of rice and sugar, packages of milk and oil, different flavors and sized packages of soft drinks, household cleaning supplies, and personal hygiene items.  This way she will keep her customers happy and satisfied.  She is very satisfied with the work she does.  She believes it is worth the sacrifice to make your dreams come true and meet the goals you have set out for your life.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her and other women who want to get ahead. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":384162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T15:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda Zulema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":172.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074962,"comment":null},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":171.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990331,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":172.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835299,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":172.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727037,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":172.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117531,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":172.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953398,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-20T20:23:06Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135013,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres en Acci\u00f3n - Picota\u201d, Distrito de Picota, Provincia de Picota, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loA. until the very end of the loA. term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loA. term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":384205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To

EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":384208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a

S. is a 62-year-old widow and a mother of two children, ages 19 and 21.

Balut sells every night, as it\u2019s a huge Filipino favorite. Francisca profits nicely in her balut business, a great help in augmenting her rice and dried fish income.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore her children entered college, Francisca sustained her enterprises through loans available through ASHI with all profits going to her children\u2019s support. Now, however, with the greater expenses of college, Francisca must work harder to increase her profits, especially since she is widowed and with no other source of income. She has determined that once her children have finished their studies, she will save her income for both family emergencies and her businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nFor now, she is requesting from ASHI a loan for additional business capital so she can buy larger volumes of rice and dried fish to sell.

Through hog fattening Helen also felt that she could have a source of capital for her rice production business. She would use the funds from selling her pigs towards the rice farming. She would also be able to run her rice production business independently from the allowance given to her by her two single sons.\r\n\r\nHelen has four children and a farmer husband. Her two eldest children have their own families now, while her third son has been working abroad for a year. Her youngest son works in a factory in Manila. Helen and her farmer husband work their farm and hire farm laborers only during planting season. Every planting season, Helen worries about the expenses that her farm requires to produce rice. She doesn\u2019t want to oblige her children to provide for her financial needs. For this reason, she wants to expand her hog fattening business. In the hog fattening business, profit can be as much as double the amount of capital after only four months of raising pigs. The more pigs she has to sell, the more Helen will profit. With the loan Helen is presently requesting, she will buy more pigs and she will also finance the planting of rice.\r\n\r\nWhen Helen\u2019s business becomes stable, she would like to help her

V., 20 years old, joined ASHI early in 2009 to be able to have access to credit for starting a business. A variety store was the first business she thought she knew how to run and could augment the income her husband is earning from being a cook of one eatery in their town. However, Jocelyn was not able to control people crediting from her store, therefore, her business towards the end of her loan lost its capital.  Through the financial support of her husband, she was able to pay back her loan on time and have another business, eight months ago, which is hog fattening. \r\nWith the hog fattening business, Jocelyn profits as much double the amount of her capital after only four months of raising the pig. For the second time with ASHI, Jocelyn is requesting a loan which she will use for financing her hog fattening (pig raising) business. The more pigs she will raise and sell, the more profit she will be making. As they don\u2019t have children yet, she wants to prepare financially for a time when they will have

V., 38, is married to Herson, a government employee. They have three children who range in age from 4 to 15. Her eldest two children are in high school. Maribeth became a member of ASHI in 1998 and since then has been able to access credit for business development. She then started a variety store. Initially income generated from the business was insufficient to sustain her family's needs. However, her business grew because of the loans she continuously received from ASHI. She also acquired a space in the municipality\u2019s public market to sell goods.\r\n\r\nAfter Maribeth gave birth to her youngest child, she decided to temporarily close her business as there was no one to look after her children at home and attend to their needs, especially to the needs of her youngest. Being without business for over a year, Maribeth realized that her husband\u2019s income alone is insufficient to finance the growing expenses of their family, including her children's educational expenses. Therefore, Maribeth requested a loan from ASHI to re-start her business. After three years, she was able to grow her business again. She now requests for a larger amount of loan as additional capital to expand her business. This is mainly to prepare for the upcoming college education of her two elder children and also for the education of her youngest child.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":384228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her future business plans are to buy a van and to open a greengrocer\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nAsel has three partners: Elmira, Gulzana and Gerindi:\r\n\r\nElmira, 37, is a widow and the mother of four children.

She needs a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n\r\nGulzana, 32, has a small family consisting of her, her husband, a six-year old daughter and a four-year old son.

N. is from the village of Mamanga Daku. She is 46 years old. Nilda is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Nilda owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products such as fish and shrimp in the local community. Nilda has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nilda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nilda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Nilda is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan Nilda has received from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 31 years old. Janet is single and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Janet owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Janet is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Janet joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Janet is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Janet from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is a married twenty-three year-old from the village of Sta.

Renato has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately PHP10,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nThis year Renato joined PMPC to gain access to financial services in order to improve his living situation and business. Renato is requesting a new loan of PHP 25,000 that will be used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Renato from PMPC.

As of now, she has a variety store that sell different goods that needed by the people living nearby houses and also a store that sell batchoy, a noodle soup that mostly Filipino eat, both this business contributes in their income. This business comes from the loan that she loan in ASHI.\n\nNow, Teresita wants again to help her husband in growing the business that he manages, which is the farming rice business. She will have a loan again to Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) for buying fertilizers and other things that are needed in making the business of her husband to grow so that someday they will have their own rice field to cultivate.\n\nAlso Teresita is a loving mother to their only son Jerry who is now 26 years old. She is hoping that he will give him a better life and a happy family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":384366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Will be

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jyldyz is the leader of this group. At the age of thirty-six, she is divorced and raises two daughters on her own. To earn her small family\u2019s living she works in a nursing home as a matron. Both of her daughters go to school, and as they grow, Jyldyz\u2019s monthly salary of $50 has begun to be insufficient to provide everything for her daughters. So Jyldyz has found herself an extra occupation, selling fruits. Her sister has been selling fruits for many years and once advised her to start doing the same. She helped Jyldyz with the first purchase and now this new activity allows Jyldyz to cover her family\u2019s living expenses. Jyldyz has decided to obtain a loan and purchase fruits in a neighboring region in larger quantities and bring them to her town to sell. This way she would be able to earn more money and make a needed repair at her house. Jyldyz is ready to do everything within her capability to provide her daughters with a good college education. In the near future she is going to open a small shop. \r\n\r\nJyldyz\u2019s partners are: Zamira, Erkingul and Taasil. Zamira, age 43, has raised four children. She is engaged in cattle breeding and her husband is an excavator operator. Her 19-year-old daughter helps Zamira keep house. Zamira needs a loan to purchase fodder and hay for the cattle.\r\n\r\nErkingul, age 26, has two children. Her husband sells flour. Before, he used to receive flour instead of a salary, which he would exchange for cattle. He would then feed and resell them. Now Erkingul is engaged in raising the cattle. Erkingul needs a loan to purchase calves and fodder for them.\r\n\r\nTaasil, age 47, has mothered six children. Most of them have left for Russia to work. Her husband works at a construction site and she bakes bread and manufactures traditional articles. Taasil needs a loan to purchase coal, as winter is approaching. \r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The leader of this group, Tatyana, a twenty-nine-year-old woman, sells flowers to earn a living. Her husband is an operator in a beer-selling company. They have two children: a daughter and a son who are eleven and six years old respectively.\r\n\r\nIt is due to her caring husband that Tatyana was able to start her own business. The point is that, four month ago, her husband took a risk in investing his savings, around $240, in taking a florist\u2019s shop on a lease. The expense was worth it as now, Tatyana is able to independently earn her own money. Her husband still helps her transporting the flowers.\r\n\r\nAfter running her shop for some months, Tatyana has a desire to make her shop more attractive and fashionable. She has gained some experience and has the vision of improving the interior of her shop. She sees that she will have to obtain a loan to furnish the shop: buy shelves and purchase more kinds of flowers. She also needs this loan to provide clothes for her children for the new academic year. Tatyana\u2019s dreams are to buy her own real estate, increase the turnover of her shop, and buy a hothouse.\r\n\r\nHere are Tatyana\u2019s partners: Elena, Antonina and one more Elena\r\n\r\nElena, a twenty-eight-year-old housewife, has two children. She is occupied with breeding rabbits and this activity lets her have a constant supply of meat at home. She needs a loan to buy two calves to raise and resell.\r\n\r\nAntonina, 28, is divorced and has a nine-year-old son. To provide for her small family, Antonina works as an operator in a salon containing playing machines. She urgently needs a loan for treatment of her mother, as her mother has stomach cancer.\r\n\r\nThe second Elena, 28, together with her husband, sells detergents and foodstuffs. They have one son. She started this business four years ago after her marriage, since her husband had already been engaged in trade at the market. Elena needs a loan to purchase shelves for her container.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Abduzabi is 50 years old. He is married with two children. Since he was young he has been in the business of raising and selling cattle which is why he has a lot of experience. It is necessary to point out that Abduzabi has been able to succeed thanks to the support provided by IMON International. This support has been in the form of a loan which he has used to purchase and raise young bulls in their locality. Today Abduzabi has once again come to IMON International for a loan which will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell. It is his biggest dream to improve the conditions of his business in order to then improve the conditions of his family.   \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
