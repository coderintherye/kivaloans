And then they are sold at the same marketplace and at surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions, to customers generally from large cities.\r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize, after selling their produce, an average profit of 45,000 francs CFA, which will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":329690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antoinnete   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoun\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monique ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jandarque ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e9atrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":375000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":381887.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152129,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-06T22:23:41Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113166,"name":"Manzura","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430. \u0415\u0451 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0438\u0437  \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u0417\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446 \u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0435\u0451 \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430. \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441 \u0424\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432.\n\n\n","en":"Manzura M. is a woman who takes out loans to grow her business.

With such a big family, he generates income by selling many things at his provisional store. With this loan, Alfred will purchase a number of umbrellas and bags, as well as other small provisions that his community needs. \r\n\r\nThis is Alfred\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since he became a beneficiary in 2008. With his previous loan, he financed some goats that he raised. Alfred used to raise a lot more goats, but one day he lost a herd of goats due to disease. He also lost a young forest farm in a fire. \r\n\r\nAlfred\u2019s new business strategy lies in his timing. Rainy season is upon Cameroon, and so the need for umbrellas is very high. Also, schools will reopen at the end of summer and Alfred wants to be prepared to sell bags to the school children. With the profits from this loan, Alfred plans to pay for health care costs and fund his children\u2019s educational needs. Alfred takes out GHAPE loans because he thinks they have good policies, the center is near his house, and he enjoys the fact that GHAPE is made up of people within the same community, who work to develop together.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":329697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Umbrellas, Bags, and Other Provisions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Baingo, Belo, N.W.

is married and has seven children. Her sole activity for this loan will be to buy and sell \u201cdry fish\u201d in the market in Baingo. Here, dry fish is used in many dishes as it is ground up and added in for flavor and protein. Helen will buy 100,000 CFA (about $200) worth of dry fish and use the remaining money to transport it.  \r\n\r\nThis being nothing new to Helen, she is confident she will be successful with this loan. She knows that the fish always sells in the market due to the high demand for it. This will be Helen\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2008.\r\n\r\nIn the last three years, Helen has lost three of her children. Although saddened by this unfortunate circumstance, Helen still has to take care of her other children. She plans to use the profits from this loan to pay for food for the family, pay her children\u2019s school fees and increase her business. \r\n\r\nHelen takes out GHAPE loans because the loan conditions are right for her, as she pays back her loan in small installments, instead of all at once. She also benefits from the training on loan management.  \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":329693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Dry fish and transport","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Baingo, Belo, N.W.

She began by selling salted fish with an initial capital of US$ 2, and her profits swiftly accumulated, allowing her to open up a little restaurant in 2004. The slowness with which this little restaurant developed, as far as turnover is concerned, pushed Louise to abandon it that same year and take up the selling of fish again, a business she was better versed in. <P>\r\n\r\nBeing limited as far as financial means go and in view of her ever growing clientele, in 2005, Louise decided to join one of the groups of HOPE, called \"Lisungi\" which means \"aid\", with an eye to satisfying the needs of her customers and growing the income from her business. She has been a faithful client who has had several loans through HOPE and has correctly reimbursed them. Presently, her working capital stands at US$ 200. The loan she received this past month of May is being used to buy a big basket of smoked fish which she has added to her offerings along with salted fish, mushrooms, grubs (moth larvae, an important source of protein) and small fry (very young fish) that she already sells. <P>\r\n\r\nHer business generates a profit of US$ 80 per month. Her dream is to open a general store. Louise is married, 44 years old, and the mother of 6 children from 18 to 26 years of age.

She began her own business in 1988 with a capital of US$ 5. From 1988-1990, her business prospered and reached a capital of US$ 500, which allowed her to increase her inventory and buy machines for making peanut butter. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1991 and 1993, the pillaging carried off her equipment and her whole inventory and thus caused her business to go bankrupt. Mazebo took the same business back up, timidly, around the end of the 90s. After the various wars and depreciations of the local currency, which destabilized her business, Mazebo today finds himself encouraged by the progressive stability of the politics and economics of her country. Her business depends on this stability. The loan she received this past month of May allowed her to buy a big sack of peanuts to resell, so as to increase her profit which presently stands at US$ 10 per day. <P>\r\n\r\nMazebo is 42, married, and the mother of 5 children between 8 and 24 years old. Three of them are enrolled in school. Her ambition is to open a general store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

A. is a native of Cardona, Rizal, in the Philippines. She is forty-eight years old and has three children. Her oldest son, Chad Nezzar, is eighteen years old and a high school graduate. The youngest, Christian, is in elementary school. She also has a 9-year-old boy. Her husband, Victor, is forty-five years old and a partner in their business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI partner of KIVA in the Philippines.  With her first loan, she ventured into the retail selling of charcoal. She had observed the demand for charcoal in the market and knew that selling charcoal would bring them enough profit for their day-to-day living. Now on her second loan, she is requesting 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. The loan will be used to pay for 101 sacks of charcoal and a brand new weighing scale. Josephine is hopeful that, with the financial access that she has from ASHI, she can improve her business and make it grow.\r\n<p>\r\nJosephine came from a poor family. During her childhood, she dreamed of finishing her studies, but due to financial shortages she was not able to make it. Now, her dream for her own children is to send them to school until they finish college and find jobs, so that they will not suffer the life that she had. She hopes that her business will grow and be sustainable, and is looking forward to having a space at the market someday.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":329746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy 101 sacks of charcoal and a new weighing scale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Morong, Rizal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2009-06-03T21:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52892675,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63114109,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73535495,"comment":null},{"amount":54,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2538.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86966981,"comment":null},{"amount":36,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118006866,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-04T23:32:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T09:57:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113205,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Mario vive en casa de su madre en la calle Jaimes Freyre de la zona de Tembladerani de la ciudad de La Paz;

He lives in his own house, and what he desires most is a quiet retirement. One of the most well known restaurants in the city of Juliaca is \"Fundo Viejo\", which is run by Luis. At 30 years of age, he decided to start a food business, and today, 30 years later, he realizes this was not a bad idea. With the passing years, his income, thanks to the popularity of his restaurant, has grown. Not only does Luis manage the restaurant, he is also the chef, and the flavor of his food is exquisite--that is why is business is always full of customers. In the future, he wishes to open another branch to make his business more well known. The most difficult part of his job is attending to the large number of diners. Although he knows this is what he has to do everyday, it does not detract from his eagerness to reach his goals. This is his fourth loan with MFP. He has always been very punctual in his repayments and hopes to do so again. He is a very responsible and respectful member in his communal bank, for which he is well liked in his group.

She has been making a living selling fruits and vegetables for the past 10 years. Her business is located in the central market. Previously she only had a small basket to sell vegetables from every morning after waking up very early looking to survive. Now she has more products and more variety, and thanks to the loans she's received she's been able to maintain her business and provide for her children's education. She plans to use the money she's requesting for the purchase of bananas, onions, tomatoes and pineapple, among other fruits and vegetables.

Angela sells raffle tickets and fried foods on the weekends. For economic reasons, Angela\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t able to provide her with an education.  This is why she earns her living in such a modest, but honorable, manner. The raffle ticket business consists of selling a series of numbers for C$15 each. The lucky winner receives C$1,000. However, she would like to do a raffle for a larger amount, and for that she needs more capital. She also would like to invest working capital in basic grains so that she can continue cooking fried foods and keep her many customers. She cooks very well and keeps a clean kitchen. Her biggest wish is to increase her raffle sales and to open a small caf\u00e9, which would allow her to have more income. This is what inspired her to request a loan. Currently, monetary devaluation is making products more expensive and she still needs to work hard for the two children who live with her. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":329939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-06-07T05:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36,"local_amount":677.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":688.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956993,"comment":null},{"amount":389,"local_amount":7322.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7437.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174447,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

S. is from the village of Panduma Sur, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

Fatima is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nFatima joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fatima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Fatima is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase ingredients to cook more food to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Fatima from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her immediate family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Because she never had the chance to progress in school, she soon became interested in income-generating work.  After having worked in many kinds of businesses unsuccessfully, she decided about five years ago to become familiar with buying and selling cooking oil.  She operates this business in her house and at the district marketplace, where she has a spot.  She is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso a few months ago.  She is now on her first individual loan.  With this loan, she intends to buy twenty 20-liter drums of cooking oil.  She supplies herself by special order in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and sometimes at local oil mills.  And then she sells her products retail, cash or credit accepted, to customers essentially composed of women. \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":330115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy cooking oil ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50146.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243074,"comment":null},{"amount":54.18,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25073.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678937,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":25073.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112684,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25073.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028250,"comment":null},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25073.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T09:58:41Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113299,"name":"Marivic","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marivic U., 29 years old, is married and blessed with three children.

They are now on their third agricultural loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With the current loan, they intend to buy fifteen small hoes for planting and weeding and also 80 kg of peanut seeds for planting, purchased directly at the Bougouni marketplace.  Upon harvest, they are planning on a production of 1.32 tonnes of peanuts and 4.5 tonnes of sorghum.  The produce is sold in cash at the Bougouni marketplace.  Their customers are composed of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith a price of 300 francs CFA per kilo for peanuts and 100 francs a kilo for sorghum, the group members each hope to obtain a profit of 40,000 francs at the end of the crop year.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Businesses here include double-branched produce (meat and milk) and growing various basic grains such as rice, beans, and corn among others. As there is high unemployment, Juan Carlos wishes to begin a small agricultural business specializing in growing rice to sell locally as well as to neighboring communities. According to Juan Carlos, there is an excellent market to sell to middlemen or directly to the public.\r\n<p>\r\nTwo years ago he began to grow rice, taught by his father how to care and maintain for this type of crop. He has a small plot of land where he has previously sown rice and had good results. Now he would like to expand this crop since thanks to its profitability he has been able to improve his family's quality of life considerably. \r\n<p>\r\nJuan Carlos is now requesting a micro loan of 684,000 colones to prepare the land, and buy seed, fertilizer and other supplies necessary to guarantee an optimal rice harvest. Juan Carlos is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Datraban (The Datraban Business Credit Collective), one of 100 organizations belonging to EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his second loan and with it he hopes to grow personally and economically.

The biggest difficulty is that pests invade the crop because, for lack of funds, she is unable to use pesticides. With the loan she will buy fertilizers and other inputs to obtain a better harvest and a better income. Thanks to Afodenic, she is able to make progress with her project. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":330370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers and other inputs to improve her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-06-07T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claricsa Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8125.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002638,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T00:01:26Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113395,"name":"Cecilio Efrain","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Cecilio Efra\u00edn O., tiene la edad de 46 a\u00f1os, habita en el barrio San Jos\u00e9 de los R\u00edos, junto a su esposa la cual le apoya con los gastos del hogar, ellos tiene tres hijos de catorce, once y seis a\u00f1os; ellos estudian y le apoyan con las actividades agr\u00edcolas, los planes hacia su familia es mejorar las condiciones de vida, desde hace 30 a\u00f1os don Cecilio se dedica a los trabajos agr\u00edcolas, con sus propios esfuerzos a logrado establecer parte de sus cultivos , la mayor dificultad que se le presenta es la falta de financiamiento.

B. is 51 years old and lives with her partner, her son and her 7 year old granddaughter.  \r\n<p><p\/>\r\nThe community in which Ms. Carmen lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the Cartago province.  It is a small rural community of approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The residents work in milk production and coffee planting.  The terrain is uneven and much of the land is tropical rainforest.  The community has a very picturesque landscape that combines the tropical forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and dairies.  El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the city and commercial center.  Unfortunately, several times a year the road becomes impassible due to the heavy rains that batter the region.  This is, without a doubt, one of community\u2019s main challenges.\r\n<p><p>\r\nYears ago, when no viable productive activities existed, many people opted to leave and look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.  Presently coffee and milk prices have improved so residents are figuring out how to invest in projects in the same area and this way avoid having to move.\r\n<p><p>\r\nMs. Carmen started her business, a small restaurant with Creole food called a \u201csoda\u201d, in her own house.  She says that this way she can help with household expenses and she also feels happy to have her own business because she has been very well received in the community.  Carmen commented that the biggest attraction in her restaurant are the tamales, which are a very typical food in Costa Rica.  \r\n<p><p>\r\nRight now she needs a loan of 500,000 colones (Costa Rican Currency) to purchase more merchandise that she can sell, to increase her business and offer better service to her neighbors and the tourists who pass through the area.  More specifically, she will buy a machine to grind corn, an extra large pot to cook tamales in, a large container to mix the dough in, a plastic basket to sell the product, and the ingredients necessary for its production.\r\n<p><p>\r\nMs. Carmen is a member of the Productores del Sauce de Santa Teresita Association, one of the 100 member groups of the EDESA in Costa Rica.

M. is from the village of Tinaclaan, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 54 years old. Minda is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Minda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Minda has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Minda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Minda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Minda is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Minda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve & expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: \r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":330507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

P. is a jovial and enterprising 28-year-old man. He is married with 2 children. He lives in the Kuta area of Bali with his extended family, about 8 of whom work for him making wristbands out of leather scraps. He sells these to local and international wholesalers. Heri\u2019s wristbands are sold in Bali at big supermarkets like Matahari and Centro.<P>\r\n\r\nHeri wants to borrow 1m IDR (about USD 100) to buy raw materials. This is his 3rd loan with Kiva. He has always made repayments on time or even ahead of schedule. Heri\u2019s clients pay him only when he delivers his finished goods. For that reason, loans are very important to him because they allow him to buy leather scraps to make wristbands for which he has already received orders. <P>\r\n\r\nEventually, Heri would like to build his credit history to the point where he can borrow 20m IDR (about USD 2000), which is enough to buy 1 ton (1000 kg) of leather scraps. When he can afford to raise that amount of capital, he will also bring in more family members from Java to help him produce more wristbands faster. He is confident that he has the client base to support a higher rate of production, especially during the busy tourist

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kurban is 57 years old. He is married with 4 children. Kurban sells confectionery and other foodstuffs in the market. He has been in this business for 5 years. This activity generates the main income for the family of Kurban. Since Kurban is very popular in the market selling fresh and tasty foodstuffs, he tries to maintain a wide range of goods. Thus, today Kurban requests 1000 US Dollars for purchasing foodstuffs to sell.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

In the past they have had problems in harvesting; having to sell their crop in advance and see reduced earnings. <P>\r\n\r\n By this time Mukim has gained a lot of experience in his business and now his crop is one of the most sought after at the market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

more than 8 years, Mavzuna, together with her mother (pictured), has been working in the largest local market of the city. She sells rice and cottonseed oil. Her business is situated in the central market where there are always a lot of people, so that the business is very stable and generates  stable income for her family. <P>\r\n\r\nMavzuna has been working with IMON for a year and has proved herself an accurate client. Today she requests 3500 Somoni for purchasing rice and cottonseed oil to sell. Mavzuna thanks all for support and promises to repay the loan on time.    <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Aslonjon is a lively entrepreneur with a small business selling shoes for teenagers. He is an experienced entrepreneur having been self-employed for the past 15 years. Business has been good for Aslonjon. There is always demand for shoes and as the economy has improved in Tajikistan, more people have been able to afford new shoes.\r\n<p>\r\nAslonjon is married and has 4 children. He is doing all his best to ensure his children have the best future. Aslonjon has requested a loan of $800 USD to increase his available working capital. Eventually Aslonjon hopes to have his own small store. This loan will help him purchase new inventory and continue to invest in his business.    \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After the rainy season, the harvests are stocked for a certain time so that they gain in value before being sold in the market of M\u2019pessoba and the surrounding markets, retair and wholesale, for cash, to a clientele coming mostly from the big cities. <P>\r\n\r\nEach of the members of the  Ankabenk\u00e9lenkan 2. 4 group expects to make a profit of 70,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and for current family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":330605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of intrants, seed, and minor agricultural materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djelika Kassim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Diarra Mamoutou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9bou S\u00e9kou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou Chaka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata Madane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou Kassoun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":601966.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T04:39:49Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113525,"name":"43-Nam Ng\u1ea1n Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G\u00e1i L\u00ea Th\u1ecb (128) is a 59 year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.

They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. And they have an average age of 35 and at least five children.  They grow mainly rice, and they grown peanuts as a secondary business.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program five years ago.  After having correctly repaid the first four loans, they are now on their fifth farm loan.  The current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts; some minor supplies and equipment; and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Fonfona, M\u2019pessoba, and Zansoni.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.

After the rainy season, the harvests will be stockpiled for a certain time so that they gain increased value before being sold at the market of M\u2019pessoba and in the surrounding markets, retail and wholesale, for cash, to a clientele coming generally from the big cities. <P> \r\n\r\nEach of the members of the Ankabenk\u00e9lenkan 2. 10 group expects to make, after their yield is sold, a profit of 60,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and cover current family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":330636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of intrants, seed, and minor agricultural materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Yssouf ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doussou Chaca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Zoumana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Sinali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan Sabali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Moulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba Sourakata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":509356.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-14T00:53:46Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113545,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is 22 years old and she is single.

L. is a woman from the mountainous city of Antipolo in the Province of Rizal, Philippines. She is 47 years old and married to Nandito Lumerio, a carpenter and a hired construction worker. They were blessed with 3 daughters. The eldest daughter Jesamin is 23-year-old and a college graduate. The youngest daughter Joymay is 12-year-old and in elementary grade.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2006, Josefina joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap,Inc.) an MFI in the Philippines and a Kiva partner. During her previous loans, she tried a general store but she realizes that there are many general stores now going up on their village. Then she decided to try retailing assorted goods such as smoked and dried fish, among many others.\r\n<P>\r\nNow in her 6th loan, she is requesting the amount of 35,000 Philippine Pesos to be used as additional capital in her primary business, retail.

Z. is a 59-year-old woman from the beautiful city of Antipolo, Rizal Province in the Philippines. She is widowed and doesn\u2019t have a child. She is living on her own. But despite the situation, she has not lost determination and the industry to strive for a better living.\r\nLife was not easy for Luduvina after losing her husband.

She is now on her seventh loan, which she plans to use to buy additional inventory, particularly rice, fabric conditioner, detergent and also pigs.\r\n\r\nMarilyn's main goal is to save for the future of her children and send them to school until they finish college and find good jobs. She is also working hard on the success of her business and looking forward to having space in the local market, which would give her easier access to customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":330669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy additional supplies to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Antipolo City, Rizal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2009-06-05T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5188.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52892680,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5188.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63114114,"comment":null},{"amount":88,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4150.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73535500,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5188.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86966986,"comment":null},{"amount":132,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6225.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128878403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T16:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:52:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113559,"name":"Toyin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Toyin is 40 years old, married and has four children.

Despite this, she has been able to raise her four children. Now, three of her four children are living on their own, and the youngest one is still under her loving care as she provides him with food and education. She started her business when her husband left her. At that time she wasn\u2019t working because she had just given birth. Even then, in the middle of all of this, Julia says that God gave her the wisdom to start a business that would help her raise her four children. <\/p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Although she began gardening, she put enough money together to buy and raise pigs, slaughter them and sell the meat. Today, Julia has a general store. Her family situation and her financial stability have greatly improved.

El producto que principalmente cultivan es la papa, por el momento, Juan siembra en tierras que le cedieron sus padres, y su experiencia como agricultor le dice que las mejores ganancias se obtienen de la venta directa de sus productos en los mercados locales, as\u00ed como la venta de animales en las ferias ganaderas cada 2 meses. Para un futuro cercano, Juan planea adquirir sus propias tierras de cultivo para incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Esta es la segunda vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, es un socio relativamente nuevo en su banco comunal, y ha demostrado responsabilidad en sus pagos, por lo que ha sido nuevamente considerado para este ciclo. Esto lo motiva a permanecer constante y comprometido con su grupo.

Since his childhood he has worked in agriculture as well as raising and selling animals.  Everyday, along with his wife, he takes care of his land and brings his animals to fields where there are abundant fresh grass to feed from.  His principal crop is potatoes and for the time being, he is planting on land that his parents gave to him.  His experience as a farmer tells him that he can gain more income by selling his product directly in the local markets, as well as selling his animals in the markets every two months.  \r\n\r\nIn the near future, Juan plans on adquiring his own farmland to increase his production.  This is the second time that Juan has had a loan with MFP.

She also has a small mini market in her home.  She started this business eight years ago.  She started as a street vendor selling clothes and shoes from a basket.  She did this until her eleven and twelve year old daughters gave her the idea to set up a mini market in their home.  This way the little ones promised to tend the store when they were not in class.  Then, their mother, Blanca, would be able to sell the other articles.  Blanca then got many customers to whom she gave her home address.  This way she does not have to walk too much, and her daughters can completely devote themselves to their studies.  Her daughters will be entering the university.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business and open a general store.  Her biggest challenge is to finish preparing her daughters.  In order to do this she needs to keep her business stable.\r\n\r\nThat is why she needs a loan.

For two years, she has sold cosmetics by catalog.  She sells one of the most well-known brands in the country.  Every day she goes to the homes of her friends, neighbors, and other people that she knows to sell her products.  Then, in the afternoons, she takes inventory of what she sold and the orders she took.  Days later, she visits her customers again to collect the money, since she generally sells on credit.  Although it is tiring to do this work, it gives her great satisfaction.  She has her own goals, which she reaches every month.  In the near future, Vilma hopes to establish a sales stand in a central commercial area in her community.

They cultivate principally rice, with peanuts as a secondary crop.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the intention of making their agricultural businesses profitable, the members of the Djidja 2 .2 group decided to join the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After having correctly reimbursed the three preceding loans, they are on their fourth rural loan.<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy rice seedlings, peanut seeds, minor material and intrants for their crops at the markets of Zansoni, M\u2019pessoba, and Fonfona. After the rainy season, the harvests are stockpiled for a certain time so that they gain in value before being sold at the market of M\u2019pessoba and of Koutiala, retail and wholesale, for cash, to a clientele generally coming from the big cities.<P>\r\n\r\nEach of the members of the Djidja 2 .2 group expects to make, after their crops have been sold, a profit of 85,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and for current family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":330769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of intrants, seeds, and minor agricultural materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diaratou Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba Bolitigui ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Lassina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Nadounma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8 Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou Alou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":706153.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021271,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-05T17:07:13Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113625,"name":"Tatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatu I. is a married Tanzanian woman and small business owner.

After having correctly repaid the three preceding loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts, some minor supplies and equipment, and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Zansoni, M\u2019pessoba, and Fonfona.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba and Koutiala markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 65,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":330777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koro Yssouf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8 Aly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam S\u00e9kou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam Yaya  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Yamoussa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou Zanga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Noumougolo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Nianz\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":550000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":550000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":555661.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T18:44:20Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113628,"name":"Roxana Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roxana V.

Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDo\u00f1a Roxana se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Dice estar muy contenta porque gracias a este proyecto ha podido salir adelante y ayudarle a su esposo con los gastos de la casa y de los ni\u00f1os. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es famoso en todo Costa Rica.

F. is a young lady, 25 years of age, who lives with her husband and two children.  The community where they live is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in Cartago Province.\r\nIt's a small rural community of some 2,000 residents.  The townspeople work at producing milk and growing coffee.  \r\nThe area has a varied terrain and much of the land is preserved as tropical rain forest.  The community has very picturesque scenery which combines tropical forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and dairy farms.  El Sauce is located about 90 minutes by bus from the nearest commercial center, Turrialba.  However, at various times of the year the road is impassable due to the flooding that afflicts the area.  This is without a doubt one of the principal challenges for the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do, many people decided to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in the banana plantations located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Currently the prices for coffee and milk have improved and therefore the locals are looking to invest in projects in this area so as to avoid having to migrate.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana works at producing milk and cheese as a way of generating income for her family.  She say she is very satisfied because thanks to this project she has been able to get ahead and help her husband with the expenses for their household and the children.\r\nThe cheese from the region where she lives, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo, is famous throughout Costa Rica.  It is a \"queso fresco\" (fresh cheese) which is traditionally known as Turrialba-style.  Ticos, as Costa Ricans are called, love to consume this product and it is found on the table as an accompaniment to all types of food.  For this reason the market for this product is quite good.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana would like to obtain a micro-credit loan of 500,000 Colons in order to buy another milk cow so as to increase milk production.  She knows that having another cow is a great sacrifice and will require more work.  However, the desire to be a successful small businesswoman and to get started improving her family's living conditions motivates her to exert herself with great care and dedication.\r\nDo\u00f1a Roxana is a client of the Producers' Association of El Sauce, a member organization of EDESA Micro-Finance.  This will be her first loan and she hopes to continue growing both personally and economically.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva

","en":"Mayra R. M. is 27 and is the single mother of 2 children under her care.  The biggest fight she has had to face as a mother is the health of her daughter, since she is constantly sick.  Mayra sells pork, beverages, and sliced plantains.  She has been developing this business since she was 13, when she had to help her parents because they were very poor and the entire family worked.  This is why she couldn't have an education.  Three years ago, she decided to start her own business so she could contribute a little more income to her parents.  When she started her own family, she started to sell her food on buses until she could obtain a stand on the street where she sells her beverages, pork, and sliced plantains.
