She learned these skills from her grandparents, who were successful basket weavers in prior years. Besides making baskets herself, she also buys them from other local weavers and then resells them to her frequent and regular customers. She said that many of her products are sold in the markets, especially to foreigners visiting Cambodia.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAntonia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nAntonia dreams of being able to give all of her children a high quality education through her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

She is married with three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Sabreen wants to improve her family's home living conditions by purchasing necessary new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her children, living room furniture, a kitchen table, etc., but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for it, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Sabreen gets the loan, she will purchase what furniture the family needs to live in better home conditions. Sabreen is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. \r\n\r\nAsmaa' wants to purchase some home furniture that she doesn't have at home such as a kitchen table and living room furniture but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for this so she needs to borrow a loan from FATEN.  When Asmaa' gets the loan she will be able to buy the furniture she wants which will have a positive effect on her life and she will offer to her family a better home. Asmaa' is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed here instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is a taxi driver with a low income. Talal wants to make necessary repairs to his taxi such as: changing the doors, painting, changing the taxi tires, etc.  but he doesn't have enough to do this, so he needs to take a loan from Kiva partner FATEN. When Talal gets the loan, he will pay the expenses of making the necessary repairs to the taxi, this will increase the taxi efficiency and enable Talal to work extra hours to increase his income and provide to his family better living conditions. Talal is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a 31 year-old young woman who is married and has two sons and two daughters, her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Samaher wants to purchase some new home furniture such as: bedroom furniture for her children, living room furniture, etc. but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she would like to take a loan from Kiva partner FATEN. When Samaher gets the loan, she will change the life of her family positively by purchasing what they need to make their living conditions better. Samaher is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

One works in Venezuela, and the other works in the city of Trujillo to the north of the country. \r\n\r\nThanks to her work, she got her children ahead, and she is proud of them.  Her main business activity is farming; she grows potatoes and vegetables.  She has very astutely been taking care of her crops for 19 years.  She says that with her husband\u2019s support she is also able to raise animals like sheep and pigs.  She sells them together with the harvest at the fair in the city of Jauja.  They get good earnings there mainly because her husband makes the most of it by taking his \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle) to provide public transportation among the streets of the city.\r\n\r\nNow they wish to improve their income for their minor children\u2019s future.  She belongs to the \u201cMujeres Luchadora\u201d (Tenacious Women) communal bank.  This is her third loan with MFP.  She hopes for support from all of you to achieve her objective.  She pledges to be punctual with her payments.  Her association is comprised of responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving your support she will use the requested money to buy natural fertilizers for her next planting of beans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":148.76,"image":{"id":925513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liverata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":115.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":138.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":144.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":140.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":154.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":161.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":172.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":178.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.21,"local_amount":115.32,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":119.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836176,"comment":null},{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":133.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":138.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245940,"comment":null},{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":138.87,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385965,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T05:03:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":361068,"name":"Mar\u00eda Luzmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Luzmila a sus 54 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de cuatro hijos.

Her bakery, Panader\u00eda Elia, has been around for more than 10 years, nad is a family business where she works with her husband and children. The purpose of the loan is to invest in getting an oven repaired to increase the quantity of bread they make. \r\n\r\nHer day begins at 4am when she starts baking the bread she has prepared the night before. The bakery opens for business at 5.30am for people who have to to work early in the morning. Their children are grown up and don't have to go to school, so they can help by working in the bakery and by distributing the produce to local grocery stores, which increases the income to the business and expands the operation to get their products known. \r\n\r\nAmong their goals are to improve the bakery's equipment, modernising it to improve the quality and effiicency of production. They would like to open other branches of the business and to improve the family's standard of living.

She prepares and sells food. Her main product is hayacas: a dough made of corn or rice, filled with vegetables and meat, and wrapped in banana leaves. She first learned through family tradition, in Oca\u00f1a a town north of Santander. She watched from the time she was a young girl at family gatherings the preparation of this delicious food, which Maria perfected over time, especially when she emigrated from her birthplace of Oca\u00f1a in search of opportunities toward the Caribbean coast of Colombia.\r\n\r\nShe began with little funding, carrying her products from store to store in her neighborhood. Very soon she began to fan out to surrounding communities focusing on the quality of her products and good prices.\r\n\r\nToday she wants to expand even more and has chosen the month of December, because not only are the hayacas purchased for resale, but also for immediate consumption, so this is just what she will accomplish, the sales will increase and so will her growth.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her profit in order to be able to continue supporting her daughter and paying for the professional studies that she will begin in 2012. At this time she is asking for a Kiva loan, her first loan that will be made through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, in order to obtain discounts, and also to buy a chopper with which to prepare hayacas in a more effective way, and to meet the requests of her clients during these Happy New Year celebrations where everyone shares food and abundance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117.96,"image":{"id":925666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, to receive a discount, and a chopper to use while preparing hayacas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T01:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73173},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74880},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76627},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78415},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80245},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82117},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84033},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85994},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88001},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90054},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92155},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94306}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":73173,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73604.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780330,"comment":null},{"amount":39.31,"local_amount":74880,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":75321.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188721,"comment":null},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":76627,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77079.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T21:12:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":361133,"name":"Luis Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Luis Fernando a sus 63 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a la venta de leche desde hace 17 a\u00f1os.
