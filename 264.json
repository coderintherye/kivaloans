She wants to borrow a loan from Kiva lenders amounting to PHP 5,000 as additional capital. She manages the business patiently and has in her mind that \u201cpatience is the key to success\u201d. She is 28 years old, married to Alazen, a farm laborer in their village. They are blessed with two children: Christian Earl Cedrick is 5 years old and Aliyah is 1 year old. The family resides in the village of Pallua Norte Tuguegarao City. \r\n\r\nAccording to Maricris, she will use the loan in sustaining her general store. Selling has been her passion since her childhood and she really enjoys the business. She believes that aside from money, a business will become more successful if it is managed with passion. Some of the loan's use will be in purchasing five kilos of sugar, ten kilos of rice, milk, coffee, toothpaste, fragrance soap, and mild detergent soap. Maricris hopes that someday her business will become productive through the support of Kiva lenders.

Most people in this village have a background as farmers who lean on the agriculture sector in meeting their family needs. They usually sell their agricultural products at market in Kupang City as there is no local market available in this area. The challenge that the community faces in running their businesses is the meager availability of public transport in this area. The public transport only operates for 2 days in a week and it costs IDR 25,000 per return trip.\r\n\r\nGibeon C1 is led by Thomas B. - a 33-year-old man. Just as with many other people in this village, Thomas and his wife count on the agriculture sector for their livelihood. From their marriage, Thomas and his wife have been blessed with 3 children, they are: \r\n- Esthon B., 11 years old and in the Fifth Grade of Elementary School;\r\n- Renita B., 9 years old and in the Fourth Grade of Elementary School; and \r\n- Rosana B., 6 years old and in the First Grade of Elementary School.\r\n \r\nAs the father of 3 children, Thomas always works hard to meet all of his family's daily needs by selling vegetables. Thomas and his wife are diligent in cultivating the farm and watering the vegetables on the farm every morning and evening. When the vegetables are ready to be harvested, they will bring them to Inpres Market to be sold on Tuesday and Thursday. They usually open the business in the market at 6 am and close around 2 pm. Nevertheless, the income that Thomas and his wife generate is still not enough to support their family. \r\n\r\nSo Thomas and his neighbors decided to form a group of 8 farmers to join the cattle-fattening program. Thomas is interested in joining the program as he wants to improve his family's finances and to support his children\u2019s education in the future. Thomas is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten over 12 months. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. They really hope that the loan will help them in improving their living standards.  \r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Adrianus and Osias were replaced by family members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":375949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Taloitan Village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nofima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nohmensen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27000000,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2058.89,"local_amount":20400000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-26T08:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20536593.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159707716,"comment":null},{"amount":666.11,"local_amount":6600000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6644191.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177483713,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-26T11:38:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":131705,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamed M. is 36 years old and a married father of five children.

Catalina's husband is a farmer while Catalina has her own hog-fattening (pig-raising) business, aside from helping her husband in the farm as a farmer as well. It has been five years now that Catalina and her husband have been able to have a rice-farming business. This has been a great source of income for the couple so they are able to send their only child to college until graduation. <P>\r\n\r\nCatalina's loan from ASHI when she joined in 2008 was used to finance this business instead of borrowing money from other people in their neighborhood which requires bigger interest rates per month. This was what they had been doing in the past when Catalina was not yet a member of ASHI and had no access to loans. Profit then was not really big and growing a business was very hard. <P>\r\n\r\nNow that Catalina has fully paid her first loan, she is requesting a much bigger loan to be able to accelerate the quality of rice they are producing for a better price and profit. Since Catalina is still using rice land which she doesn't own, every harvest they are required to give the owner of the land a share of the rice depending how many sacks they have agreed on for every acre. Someday, through her profit and helped by loans from ASHI, Catalina wished to purchase her own rice land.

Rano is 41 years old and comes from a large but humble family. She is married and the loving mother of two children.

Now Rano dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle, and with the income she generates, she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends.<P>\r\n\r\n Rano is asking for a 4000 Somoni loan in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Akbar is a clothing merchant from Khujand, Tajikistan. He started his small business 7 years ago, and though much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. His wife (pictured) is also engaged in this business. <P>\r\n\r\nAkbar has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man. Funding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Akbar build his business. His first loan was for US$ 2500 and since that time he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history. He has requested a loan of 1000 USD to add to his available working capital. <P>\r\n\r\nThe ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for him. Akbar appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.   <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sadriddin has always been a hard-working man, who has made sure from a young age that his family never went hungry. He is married with two children. Six years ago, and with a starting capital of only $100, Sadriddin started a grocery store for selling different kinds of foodstuffs. Thanks to his perseverance and dedication, his business has expanded and now his whole family is involved. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Sadriddin needs to increase the range of goods he sells.  For this purpose he is requesting a loan of $900.  He is ready to work even harder and to make sacrifices to achieve his goal of becoming a successful entrepreneur.       \r\n      \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Farhod is married and has a young son. With the faith that his son could go to school, he started a business of processing and selling dried apricots to be able to make enough money to pay for his schooling. This is why he started this business five years ago. He is experienced in this kind of business that allows him to expand his clientele day by day. Right now Farhod needs a loan of 3000 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Burkhon lives in Isfara, Tajikistan. He is 51 years old, married and has three children. Burkhon is the sole provider for his family and earns his living by raising and selling cows and sheep at the local market. Thanks to his effort some years ago Burkhon was able to arrange the wedding of his son. Once in 2-3 months he purchases young animals from local villagers and raises them over an 8-9 month period and later sells the adult cows and sheep to local butchers. Today Burkhon is thinking about expanding his business, as his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase young cattle. That\u2019s why he is requesting a loan of $650 USD. Extend your solidarity to Burkhon so that he can move forth successfully and accomplish all his goals.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She generates 25% commission for every PHP 100 of sold products. To further increase her credit line with these companies, she is requesting a loan of PHP 16,000 from Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMagelyn also wants to help her husband to purchase other necessary items for their farm, like fertilizers, pesticides and so on, by increasing her commission from her direct-selling business. They are hoping to have development and growth both in her direct-selling business and in their agriculture business managed by her husband.

started to manage a variety store when she got married to Melquiades.

She believes that by having a complete range of items to sell, more customers will come and buy.\r\n\r\nBeatriz is already 38 years old and is a woman of strong determination, despite the disability of her leg. She is thankful that her husband helps her earn income by working in the field and by engaging in his poultry business. The couple has no children yet but it did not hinder them from keeping on growing and saving for their future children. Presently, the couple is residing in the distant village of Antagan 1st of Tumauini, Isabela.\r\n\r\nBeatriz dreams of having a stable business in the future. Her variety store which she manages at present will hopefully grow and be expanded someday. She is very optimistic that, through her determination and with the perseverance of her husband, they will be able to uplift their

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<\/em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

As the years went by, two children were born, and her responsibility blossomed, since it was necessary to work harder to maintain her humble home. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently Tansukoy requests 5000 Somoni in order to re-stock her clothing. She counts on your help and thanks all of you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<\/em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works very hard to get ahead.  She has been selling food for six years.  She sells breakfast and lunch, which she sells with carbonated drinks.  The business is in a space in her house, which is set up with some tables and chairs.  Fortunately, her oldest daughter helps her prepare the food and wait on the customers.  Tania really likes her work because she feels useful, and she keeps busy.  Also, it is very profitable for her because she is in a key area (final stop for public transportation cars).

With the money she is requesting today, she will buy more beauty products as well as a display case to display and protect her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":376142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":131},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":136.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":146.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.29,"local_amount":120.11,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":122.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081235,"comment":null},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":125.07,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":127.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997386,"comment":null},{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":131,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":133.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842730,"comment":null},{"amount":145.69,"local_amount":423.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":430.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734311,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives with her two children who are students and who support her as much as possible.  For 4 years she has been involved nonstop in the sale of food from just outside her house.  This is an activity she carries out only at nights, counting on help from her children.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that many people taste her good food, and it\u2019s because of this that it is important for Lida to give them good service.  Since she doesn\u2019t have a partner she wants to demonstrate that a single person can also get ahead in life.  Thanks to her charisma, effort and perseverance, she is getting ahead with her children.  In addition, the location of her house is very favorable since it is in an area through which many people travel.  \r\n<p>\r\nLida\u2019s dream for the future is to have a restaurant, and she will continue working hard so that her dream is realized.  This is her sixth loan with MFP.  She likes working with her group because they are responsible people, and she has met very good friends there.  With the money she is applying for she will buy chairs and tables and will also order the construction of a small kiosk where she can wait on her customers in greater comfort.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":376150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Construction of a kiosk and the purchase of furniture for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":223.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":236.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":245.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":254.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":264.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":275.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.14,"local_amount":223.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":231.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081238,"comment":null},{"amount":82.69,"local_amount":236.25,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":244.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997389,"comment":null},{"amount":85.99,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":254.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842733,"comment":null},{"amount":278.18,"local_amount":794.79,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":822.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734314,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

They do not have children and live in their own home.  Previously, Jos\u00e9 operated a public Internet caf\u00e9 but did not generate enough revenue as he expected.  Nine months ago, he decided to build 4 rooms in the space that previously housed his computer terminals and rent them out to tenants.  Business is doing well because all 4 rooms are occupied.  In addition, Jos\u00e9 is a primary school teacher at an educational institution and has been in this profession for the past 17 years.  He enjoys both of his jobs, being an employee and a small business owner, because it keeps him busy and he is able to earn additional profits instead of relying on a fixed monthly income.  \r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 is requesting his 3rd loan with MFP.  He is very happy and grateful to his Communal Bank because they supported him whenever he faced difficulties.  He knows that everyone is responsible in their own businesses and with their loan payments.  The funds he requested will be used to perform renovations to his rental rooms, including painting and installation of new floors and sinks.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":376152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Renovations to his rental space","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-25T04:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":270.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":281.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":294.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":306.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":317.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":329.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.83,"local_amount":270.23,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":277.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081239,"comment":null},{"amount":97.72,"local_amount":281.42,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":289.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997390,"comment":null},{"amount":102.34,"local_amount":294.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":302.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842734,"comment":null},{"amount":331.11,"local_amount":953.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":979.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734315,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She has been engaged in this activity for two years, attending her business everyday at whatever hour of the day.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat Gina likes most about her store is that it enables her to  have contact with many people and give them good service.

She rents it out to carry passengers.  In the future, she wants to expand her store and acquire a larger space that will permit her to have a mini-market and, thus,  better supply her neighbors with their daily necessities.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Gina's sixth loan from MFP.

She has proven herself to be a successful entrepreneur, \"graduating\" to the level of individual loans from the group solidarity program. With this individual loan, Eusebia plans to expand her inventory in her business selling non-prescription medicine to her community from her house and in the street. In particular, Eusebia plans to purchase vitamins, pain relievers and digestive aids. \r\n\r\nEusebia was inspired to start her business when she realized that many times people in her community had to travel far to get simple over-the-counter medicines they needed to improve their day-to-day lives. One can imagine what \"a headache\" it is to board a hot, overcrowded, and noisy bus to go to town center to buy medicine to cure the headache you already had. Sadly, Eusebia has a good deal of experience with lack of access to medicine as, in addition to raising her two children as a single mother, she cares for her elderly diabetic mother. Eusebia says that sometimes it can be very hard to find the proper medicine for her mother.\r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties Eusebia has a great deal of hope for the future. With her past loans she says that she has been able to increase her business while making minor improvements in her home life such as buying a \"moto\" (not a scooter per se but a far cry from a motorcycle in the American sense) to transport her family. With her new loan, she plans to continue increasing the size of her business and using the profits to make improvements to her home such as fixing the leaking roof, provide a bed for her children, and purchasing a washing machine to lessen her domestic work burden. Finally, Eusebia is currently pursuing pharmacological studies at the local university with the goal of one day opening a full-service pharmacy in her neighborhood. She believes that by working with Esperanza, staying true to God, and working hard, she can achieve this objective. She thanks all of you for your support.

She is 43 years old. Josefina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Josefina operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing rooms for rent to local community members and students. Josefina has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 15,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Josefina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 23,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in renovating her rooms-for-rent business. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 26,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to repair her rooms for rent. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Josefina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the rooms of her house to cater to more boarders, especially students from other communities. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Her house serves both as her business and her small living space. \n\nEvelyn business is a beauty salon and it has been successful, however, unreliable water from the utility company means that clients may sometimes be turned away or worse, have to wait for hours to wash hair products out of their hair. Evelyn's plan therefore is to purchase a water pump to prevent this from happening and attract more business. In addition, her dream is to use to use the new revenue from new clients to build a second story to her home so that her shop can be on the bottom floor and she can live upstairs. Also, since her home is also her business she notes that the pump will have the added benefit of providing her family with consistent running water. She thanks everyone for their support.

B. is from the village of Tabo-o, Jimenez, Msamis Occidental. She is 40 years old. Jessica is married and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Jessica owns & operates a business venture in the food sector selling fish. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying & selling fish in the local community. Jessica has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jessica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jessica is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jessica from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

J. is from the village of Puntod, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. He is 46 years old. Armando is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Armando owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing electronic repairs in the local community. Armando has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Armando joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Armando has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. Armando is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Armando from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from the village of Tabo-o, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Chona is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Chona owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling  products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Chona has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Chona joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Chona is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell to expand her product offering. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Chona from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":375976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Jacinta is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jacinta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

K., age 42, is married and has seven children.

Her husband has to travel to the city to work as a construction builder, earning an income of US $3 per day which is the primary source of income for the family. The family is also assisted by three of the children who are currently employed in a local garment factory with the income of US $3 each.\n\nThe financial crisis has been difficult for business in Cambodia this past year. This factor has played into a difficult economic year for much of the country, K. included. The country's economic struggles always seem to affect the poor the most. In light of the country's economic difficulties, K. is seeking to increase her income. She is asking for a loan of US $1200 to purchase a motorbike to transport her animal ties to sell at the other villages in the province.

In light of the country's economic difficulties, P. is seeking to increase her income. She is asking for a loan of US $1000 to start a new business of selling various kinds of fruits at a local market.

C. is 62 years old and is married to a farmer of the same age. Encarnacion and her husband, Supio, have six children. Four of them have their own family now and two still live at home and work for Encarnacion's business. \r\n<p>\r\nTen years ago Encarnacion attended a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) training course in her villlage about handicraft making. After the course, she started a small business using the skills she had learned from the training. At that time she had no access to business capital so she worked for other people and was paid only according to the number of pieces she could make in a day.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Encarnacion joined Kiva partner, ASHI. She took a loan and started her own business weaving sleeping mats using panan leaf (a kind of palm). As she continued to take loans from ASHI and save some of her profits, she was able to grow her business. Now she makes other kinds of handicrafts such as native bags from abaka (banana leaf) fiber, hats, placemats made from twigs, and other house decorations. Many souvenir shop owners visit Encarnacion's village to buy her products. Other customers are tourists and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) wanting to buy presents for their colleagues abroad. As a result, Encarnacion is requesting a larger loan to sustain and finance the increasing demand for her handicrafts.

Jubel has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Jubel joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jubel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Jubel is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide his pedicab service. This loan will be his third from HSPFI. Jubel plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Melba L. is a food vendor. She sells snack food for the neighbors just to augment her farmer husband's sporadic income. Two months ago, she decided to open a small variety store in their house. Business capital she had then came from her only child who is a laborer. This is the only child she had living with her after five other children got married and moved to their own houses nearby. Though Melba has able to maintain her small variety store, the capital she had was not enough to fill up her store with basic items and products which people in the village need. Now that she is a member of ASHI, she has applied for a loan which will complete her variety store. She hopes that with this loan she will be able to sell more necessary items in her store for the convenience of her neighbors.

The product is organically produced that explains why most of their customers\/buyers are those in the middle class and high class families in their province. \n\nFor her to further make the business

is a mother of two children, one and three years old. Her husband Randy is a baker while she has been running a hog fattening business for three years. Though she was able to have her own business, still, enhancing it and sustaining it was hard because she has no means of financing all the expenses that her family incurs. Her husband's income is also insufficient to finance all their needs.<P>\r\n\r\nEarly in 2009, Fevily joined ASHI for a loan which she used for financing her hog-fattening business. She raised more than she had raised three years ago. The profit she had from hog-fattening is as much double her capital. Now that she had fully repaid her first loan, she is requesting a much larger amount for the same business. Someday, out of her business profit, she will be able to send both of her children to school until college and then she hopes that they will have a better life.

and her husband Ricky have been  doing blacksmith manufacturing business since five years ago. They got the idea of having this kind of business from Erma's brother in-law. It was hard for them then to grow their business because they had no any other source of capital aside from their own profit which is also their source of everyday expenses. Erma's four children aging from four to 11 incur a lot of expenses from their school and other basic needs. Wanting to grow the business and finance the needs of her children at the same time, Erma joined ASHI early of 2009. She had a loan which she used in her business and now that she had repaid whole amount of it, she requests for another loan with larger amount than her previous. Her very good performance especially in repayment guarantee her of receiving her desired amount. With her blacksmith manufacturing business and the profit it will make, Erma aspired to be able to send all of her children to college and have them graduated from their own chosen course.

N. is a woman with the courage and determination to overcome poverty. She is 43 years old and the mother of four, all daughters. She was widowed and left with four children to take care of. She lives in the busy town of Morong, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Josefina when her husband died. She needed to work and look for a living to support the needs of her children. In 1999, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During her membership in ASHI, she was noted for her exemplary performance in terms of responding to her responsibilities in the organization.\r\n\r\nFor almost ten years already, Josefina has been engaged in the resale of ready-to-wear clothes and beauty products. When she first joined ASHI, she used her first loans as starting and rolling capital for the business. The business became her main source of income and she receives a good income and proceeds.\r\n\r\nNow Josefina is requesting a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for pants, short pants, T-shirts, face powder, perfumes and many others similar items. She has regular customers and she also receives and accepts orders.\r\n\r\nJosefina hopes to send her younger children to school until they finish college and find jobs. She also hopes to expand her business and be able to have more stock. She even aspires to having a space in the market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":376709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

T. hails from the city of Antipolo, Rizal province in the Philippines. She is 38 years old, married, and has two children: a boy and a girl. Her husband, Ernesto, is a private driver and is 44 years old. Loreli believes that poverty is just a stepping stone to success: just do the hard work and be a wise spender.\r\n\r\nFor almost ten years Loreli has been selling both frozen foods and ready-to-wear clothes. The business runs smoothly and has become their major source of income. She buys frozen food and stores it in her freezer and people come to buy it. Sometimes she also roams around their village to sell her frozen foods. The same with her ready-to-wear clothes: she buys the stock in bulk and displays it in her house where people, especially teenagers, are her customers.\r\n\r\nNow on her 7th loan, Loreli proposes a loan of 40,000 pesos as additional capital for her businesses. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for assorted frozen foods and the remaining amount used as rolling capital to buy ready-to-wear clothes, and for transportation and delivery expenses.\r\n\r\nLoreli is hopeful that with the trust given her by ASHI and Kiva, she can make her business grow and be able to send her children to school until college and have savings for their future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":376714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for

She is 51 years old.  She attended school until the 3rd grade in the colonial era and stopped attending due to financial considerations.  She is married and has 4 adult children who have their own homes.  She lives in the Boane district in the Marconi neighborhood with her husband and 3 grandchildren, whom she supports.  \r\n\r\nMatilde grew up with her parents and later moved with them to Manhica where she later married.  Due to the 16 year war, which was very intense in this region, she left for Boane in 1985 to find a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nDuring this same timeframe, she learned to do activities that could generate income, while her husband worked in one of the Boane quarries (this area has around 4 quarries where stones are extracted for construction of homes and roads).\r\n\r\nMatilde owns her own business.  She sells a variety of items to meet basic needs (soap, toothpaste, beer, soft drinks) that she acquires in Maputo.  She earns around 500,000MT per month and is able to save some money in a commercial Bank.\r\n\r\nShe has had loans in the past with an association that used group loan methodology, through which she took out and successfully paid off loans of 1.500,00 MT; 2.000,00 MT and 3.000,00 MT.  This loan with Hluvuku-Adsema will be her fourth, with a value of 23.500,00 MT that she will used to expand her business (by selling fish).  She wants to start selling fish because the products she currently sells have not had much demand.\r\n\r\nShe learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors who had taken out loans for 16.00,00 MT; 22.000,00 MT and 23.000,00 MT, respectively, for similar activities (selling basic goods). \r\n\r\nShe plans to pay off the loan to have access to future loans with the goal of growing her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

He is married and has four children between the ages of 4 and 18. Three of them attend school. He went to school until 7th grade, when he became ill and had to stop. In addition to his children, he supports his brothers, sending them money every month.\r\n\r\nHe left Beira in 1980 to carry out his obligatory military service in Maputo, and hasn't left Maputo since then or returned to his hometown. He is no longer enlisted and has worked as a security guard at the G4 company for more than eight years. He was trained as a soldier in Boane, which has one of the largest barracks in the country. He gets a military pension of 1500 meticals a month, and earns 3000 meticals a month as a security guard.\r\n\r\nHe lives in his own home, and plans to use the 15,000 meticals requested to buy construction materials in order to build a brick house. This is his third loan. His other loans were for the same purpose (8000 and 14,500 meticals). He learned about Hluvuku through friends and colleagues who live in Boane.\r\n\r\nHe's never had a loan from other banks or similar institutions, and he hopes to pay off the present loan in order to request further assistance, with the goal of completing and furnishing his house.

Her business partner is her second son Arnuld, who is 37 years old. Cornelia is 67 years old, yet full of determination to rise up from poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to her desire to overcome poverty, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2003. Her hope was to have access to capital for her business. She carefully spent her previous loans to stock her general store, her primary business, and on upholstery, her secondary one. Both of her businesses are performing well and she is satisfied with the proceeds she receives. She wants to invest more in her businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her 11th loan, she asks for an amount of 20,000 pesos as additional capital to pay for stock for her general store.  Part of the loan will also finance her upholstery business. She is hopeful that with the trust and confidence given by ASHI, in partnership with KIVA, she will be able to expand and make her businesses

She is 31 years old and the mother of a son who is 5 years old.  She finished her secondary education in teaching, and besides her son she also support 2 nieces who live in their home.  She does not live with her husband (father of her son).\r\n\r\nShe left the providence of Gaza when she was 20 and moved to Namaacha (the center of basic teacher training) and after completing that she went to the next level at the Institute of Primary Teachers in the city of Matola in 2001.\r\n\r\nRight now she is working as a teacher in a school in the town of Boane.  She left Gaza alone.  She receives a monthly salary of 6,142MT which she uses to sustain her family and pay her debts.  She has never had a loan through another bank and this is her second loan with Hluvuku (first with Kiva) in the amount of 14,000MT.\r\n\r\nShe intends to purchase construction materials to work on her home.  She is going to cover a part of the home with brick.  The first loan for 12,000MT was also used for the same activity.  Her dream is to see her home finished to comfort her family (son, nieces, and future children) and so she intends to pay off the loan without problems.

He is 34 years old, married, and the father of 4 children with ages between 3 and 13 years old.  The first three are in school.  He went to school until the 6th grade, but he stopped because he lacked the financial conditions to afford the expense of transportation.  He lives in his own home and also supports his mother who lives with him.\r\n\r\nHis wife is in the trade business (dedicated to selling various products).  He left the city of Maputo for Boane in the company of his parents  a long time ago.  He has worked for the state-owned company, ARA South (Regional Administration of Water) for more than 8 years, and he earns a monthly salary of 2,500MT which he uses to sustain his family and pay his debts.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva in the amount of 12,000MT, which he intends to use to purchase construction materials.  The first two loans of 8,000MT and 6,000MT respectively were used for the same activity.\r\n\r\nHe has never had credit through other institutions, and he obtained information about Hluvuku-Adsema through friends and colleagues who are clients.  He intends to pay off this loan without problems so he will be able to get more loans to finish the construction on his brick home and then furnish it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

A. is 28 years old and the mother of a boy and a girl. She got married early to Arnel, who is 32 years old and a jeepney driver. She lives in the beautiful town of Cardona, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her determination to bring a better life to her family, especially to her children, Barbara needed to engage in a business that could add support to her husband\u2019s meager income. In 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, hoping to have access to capital to start a business. When she received her first loan, she invested it in the resale of frozen foods and, with her next loan and up to the present, she is still in the same business. She likes the business since her product is in demand with families during breakfast as food for their children. She already has regular customers and even receives orders.\r\n\r\nNow, Barbara is requesting a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional capital for her resale of frozen foods. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for twenty kilos of pork longganisa (sausages flavored with indigenous spices), twenty kilos of hotdogs, twenty kilos of ground beef, and to pay for transportation expenses. Some will be set aside as rolling capital.\r\n\r\nBarbara hopes that with the support of ASHI and the assistance of Kiva lenders, she can reach her dreams: to send her children to school until college; to expand her business; and to set her family free from

With this 10,000 metical loan, she plans to acquire a variety of used clothing to expand her business and satisfy her clients.\r\n\r\nShe intends to pay off the loan in full and on time so that she can take out more loans in order to buy furniture for her house, expand her business, and hire an employee to assist her with sales and other tasks.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":388.4,"image":{"id":376766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buying and selling used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.6,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.92},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.58,"local_amount":439.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":461.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056855,"comment":null},{"amount":68.24,"local_amount":1706.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971811,"comment":null},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":1144.93,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1202.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816752,"comment":null},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":1166.36,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708931,"comment":null},{"amount":50.23,"local_amount":1266.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1329.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.42,"payment_id":123937952,"comment":null},{"amount":69.62,"local_amount":1755.03,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-31T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.58,"payment_id":123937953,"comment":null},{"amount":90.28,"local_amount":2522,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-22T07:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2648.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.6,"payment_id":128971946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T22:44:05Z","paid_date":"2010-04-22T07:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":132126,"name":"Venerando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Venerando M. is from the village of Salay Misamis Oriental.

She is a tailor who offers her great services to her neighbors. Her earnings are used to help cover her household expenses. Her work and her financial contribution have enhanced her self-esteem and her self-confidence. Dilbar is very proud of her work. This is the second time that Dilbar has requested a loan from IMON International. Having said this, Dilbar has an excellent history of on-time repayment.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International <br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History <br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He started his small business when he was in his late twenties, and gradually, through much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. Ravshanjon has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural businessman. He has requested 3000 Somoni to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Ravshanjon. He would like to buy a supply of men's shoes that will boost his inventory before the busy autumn season. Ravshanjon appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International \r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History <br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

We think Nigor\u2019s responsibility and strong character will assist her with the current loan repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Barno is married and has two grown children. She owns a little place at the central market in Djabbar Rasulov, Tajikistan, where she sells various types of clothing. Some of the advantages of her business are: variety, consistency, and affordable prices. She has been working in this business for ten years.\r\n\r\nBarno is always seeking to grow and develop her business and improve her entrepreneurial skills.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

business activity from which N. Anvarjon makes a living is the breeding of livestock. He started this business 10 years ago with a small number of livestock, but as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. According to Anvarjon, he works very hard so that he can maintain his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve the living of his family. Currently Anvarjon needs a loan of 5000 Somoni in order to purchase more cattle and later resell after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the need of his family and educate all of his children.    \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
