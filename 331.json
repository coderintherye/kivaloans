R. is from the village of Brgy, Paniki, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 39 years-old and married with three school-aged children. Divina raises crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Divina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Divina joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Divina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Divina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benilda F. is from the village of Dabburab, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 45 years old. Benilda is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nBenilda has three school-aged children. To make a living, Benilda owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Benilda has been engaged in her business for over 24 years and earns approximately 500 PHP daily from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Benilda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Benilda is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 4th loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":459132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

B. is from the village of Malaubang Ozamiz City.

Zolaida has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $75 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nZolaida joined the Kiva field partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Zolaida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Zolaida is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn V. is from the village of Brgy. Nalubbunan, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 43 years old. Marilyn is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nalubbunan Center.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is single. To make a living, Marilyn owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over twelve years and earns approximately $108 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand her business. This will be her 9th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":459232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita V. is from the village of Manaoag, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 40 years old. Carmelita is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nCarmelita is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, selling fruits and vegetables. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Carmelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used for hog raising purposes as her additional business. She plans to buy hogs and feeds. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":455639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

E. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 47 years old. Erlinda is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Erlinda runs a general store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over nineteen years and earns approximately $150 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Erlinda joined the Kiva field partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Erlinda is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 10th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":454336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

C. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 54 years old. Araceli is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Araceli raises pigs to sell. Araceli has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $69 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Araceli joined the Kiva field partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Araceli is requesting a loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support some of the members of her extended family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ofelia A. is from the village of Buenavista Santiago. She is 46 years old. Ofelia is the group leader of a thirteen-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Ofelia A.'s group.\n\nOfelia is widowed and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Ofelia works as a beautician and manicurist in their community. She has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 350 PHP daily from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Ofelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Ofelia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used in purchasing additional materials needed in the manicure and pedicure business. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":455442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

is 50 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Zavkhan province, Mongolia. He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His youngest son goes to university. \r\n<p>\r\nDuring the winter, Budragchaa works at a private company as a security guard in his town. In summertime, he makes traditional Mongolian shoes by hand. In order to supplement his earnings, sometimes he also makes deel, which is a traditional Mongolian coat. \r\n<p>\r\nBudragchaa has been making shoes for many years now. His shoes are well known and valued by his customers for their quality and design. He sells his shoes for 60,000-80,000 tugrugs (~42-56 USD) and receives between 50-60% net profit for each pair. Budragchaa would eventually like to expand his little shoe-making shop into a factory employing several people. He is requesting a 400,000 tugrug (~280 USD) loan to purchase materials such as glue, leather, rubber, and tools for his shoe-making

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elueteria is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This will be her 2nd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 43 years old. Nehemia is the group leader of an eighteen-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.The official name of this borrower's group is Nehemia C.' Group.\n\nNehemia is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she runs a general store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Nehemia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 500 PHP daily.\n\nIn 2007, Nehemia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Nehemia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":459234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Dilshod is married with five children. This is an average family in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, Dilshod is a unique entrepreneur. Together with his son he has been selling clothing in the central city market for about fifteen years. The secret of his success is simple: he tries not only to let his customers know the benefits of his products \u2013 he also creates a relationship with them, which brings them back again and again. However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is with his venture. Dilshod is seeking a loan of $2500 to re-stock merchandise in his store for the winter season. We believe that Dilshod\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their ambition is to diversify their businesses by taking up other money-earning activities such as dyeing cloth. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":459314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" purchase of various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagnouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152488,"comment":null},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991328,"comment":null},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021603,"comment":null},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746393,"comment":null},{"amount":135,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":61524.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T00:29:29Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165488,"name":"Sulton","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has chosen the market place of Camberene to buy and sell her fish, because it is a very popular place. With this income she can support her husband to take care of the daily family expenses, since he has a low income. In order to improve her business she is requesting a loan of 150 000 frs to increase her operating funds, since fish is a product that is becoming more and more expensive. \r\nMadame D. is the beneficiary of a collaborative project between U-IMCEC and PDEF, the Program for Child Development and the Family (PDEF)Seydina Issa Laye.

Although she is a bit sick from the cold of the mountains, she does not stop working because she is afraid that other merchants will take her clients.

These products are preferred there for their delicious flavor and for the vitamins they contain. At the same time, since she married, she has also worked in agriculture, planting potatoes, peas, corn, barley and tubers called oca and mashua( native products in the Peruvian mountains), with her husband. These activities are profitable because they allow them to cover their necessities and to buy good fields. For the future, she plans to plant, in large amounts and in addition, she wants to buy a motorized 3-wheeled vehicle in order to rent its services in the city. She also wants to increase her productivity. This is the tenth time she has had a loan with MFP and she is very calm because she says this is an opportunity to continue to grow economically. With respect to the work in her communal bank she says it is well organized. She intends to invest the money from the loan in merchandise for her cheese and corn business which is growing little by little. In addition, she will invest another part of the loan in bags of pea seeds, fertilizer and bottles of insecticide. She will also pay her workers for preparing the sown fields. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":459478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","use":" to buy merchandise and increase her land's productivity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T16:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3024,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933887,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T18:06:07Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165567,"name":"Dora Josefa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el Mercado Ivan Montenegro, la se\u00f1ora Dora Josefa A. se ha dedicado desde hace siete a\u00f1os a la venta de ropa de todo tipo tanto para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os la que es comercializada en su establecimiento propio.\n\nAnteriormente ella vend\u00eda la ropa ambulantemente en las calles del Mercado pero gracias a sus grandes esfuerzos, ahora vende en su establecimiento.

","en":"Albina is an entrepreneurial 45 year old woman who lives with her husband Evaristo (54 years old), with whom she had three children who no longer live with them. However, they take care of Neykel, their 7 year old grandchild, who brings joy to their lives. She owns their house, which is located in a peaceful village in the Peruvian highlands. \r\n\r\nAlbina pushes herself daily to succeed in agriculture, having already planted Peruvian potatoes, peas, corn, beans, greens, moss and alfalfa for eight years with the help of her husband. At the same time she raises small animals such as hens, cuys (\"guinea pigs\"), as well as cows and sheep which she milks every morning to make fresh cheese. These activities have proven themselves very profitable through the earnings she obtains, and she says she likes her work very much since her parents taught her from a young age that a woman should never refrain from doing any work. This is the example that she now sets for her daughters, who are successful business owners. In her words \"All effort has its reward, for this reason I've never regretted having chosen this work\". \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she plans to purchase more land to increase her planting. Moreover, she would like to build another house in the city to rent rooms and to buy a car to proviD. city transportation (taxi) services.

She lives in Mallco Chap\u00ed in the city of Cochabamba. She works in raw milk production and also in agriculture.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damiana is a single mother - her husband abandoned her with her children when they were young. She had to take responsibility for them for that moment forward. She worked twice as hard to make sure they did not lack anything and that they had a good education and a bright future. Her oldest son is married and already has a child. Mrs. Damiana advises him not to do what his father did. Her other son is finishing university and his mother is very proud that her work has allowed him to finish his studies.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy fodder to feed her cattle and increase her milk production and therefore her income. Every year she buys a truckload of soy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damiana is a very responsible and hard-working person. Her mother raised her that way. She is thankful for being an only child as she has always been able to count on her parents' support. Her parents are now older but they still live with her. She is an admirable woman and is to be much respected for being a fighter and making her way up. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":459574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fodder for dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128928953,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872731,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093375,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657757,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262006,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479190,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232769993,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T17:46:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165604,"name":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Antonieta Y.

He does not currently practice his profession due to the excessive unemployment in Bolivia.\r\n\r\nElviz lives in the city of Cochabamba.  He works Mondays through Fridays in security at the Colonial commercial center.  On the week ends he works in a restaurant.  He works everyday to be able to help his mother with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy a computer because he plans to open an Internet caf\u00e9.  He has his savings for the other part of the capital for the rest of the computers.\r\n\r\nSome of his hopes and dreams are to always help his mother and to have his own house.  His biggest wish is to work in a business where he could practice the career that he has studied.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The oldest of these works as a barber.  Her husband works as a product promoter and helps her with the household and educational expenses for their children.  She currently has a small cafe located in the eastern market.  In addition to selling food in the cafe, she also sells accessories for women. She has had this business for 3 years; she started it with the help of her husband, who gave her the severance pay from his job as an accountant in order to pay for her place in the market.  So, in this way she decided to start her cafe, which has been working little by little.  There are times when the sales are low, but she does not stop selling and she always has the help of her husband.  They both dream of giving their sons a better education and standard of life.  They have plans  to someday invest in the infrastructure of their business and also to buy a large cooler where they can store drinks and soft drinks, since at times the electricity goes down.  They have requested a loan from AFODENIC to buy soft drinks, candy and other items to sell in the cafe.

For 7 years she has sold food, which will now be her source of income that will help with the household expenses.  In addition, she likes to cook very much and this gives her an advantage because she is a good cook; this has brought a lot of demand for the dishes that she prepares. Having learned this activity from the time she was very small, since her mother taught her all of her culinary secrets, she has built a steady job from this, rising early in the morning to prepare her stews and finishing later to take them to sell in the busiest markets in her area.  In this way the business is very profitable, so she hopes to continue to thrive, little by little.  In addition, she really enjoys the work.  Carmen and her partner have many plans in mind, and hope to put them into action and for this reason they need a loan to invest in the business.  This is her eighteenth loan with MFP; she belongs to a very solid group, which helps her to accomplish her goals since all of the members of the group are very good about making their payments.

Rub\u00e9n is the motor that drives her to get ahead.  Because she had to support her baby by herself, she became a merchant selling groceries (basic needs items).  Her father helps her in the business.  She also started selling clothes a year ago.  \r\n\r\nShe is aware that she had her son very young.  She had a lot of professional plans that were thwarted.  But, she knew how to assume the roll of being a mother.  Her son is the reason for her efforts.  She has made various customers by selling clothes, and they always place lots of orders for the latest styles in the market.  This allows her to get greater income, and she considers her activity profitable.  For the future she plans to save in order to give her son an adequate quality of life.  Above all, she wants to give him a good education.  She plans to set up a clothing store to distribute her products wholesale and retail.  She also wants to have modeling shows with the creations she will make later.  She wants to study design and fashion.\r\n\r\nThis is Jhomaira\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is sure that she will make her payments punctually because she wants to access more loans that will allow her to grow economically.  That way she will improve her general situation.  She says that she likes to work with the members of her communal bank because she knows them very well.  She plans to use the money from the loan to buy clothing and footwear.  Her customers have asked for these items, and she will take advantage of the Christmas season.

Soto, which is 7 km. from the Paraguar\u00ed Office.  They met with the idea of accessing a loan through the communal bank.  From there, we ran the meeting to clarify the details of the program.  They accepted the opportunity to qualify in order to increase their working capital and increase their income.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s name is Santa Luc\u00eda.  They are in their eleventh cycle.  The group is comprised of 16 unassuming women who do near the impossible to improve the level of life for themselves and their respective families.  All of the members are active and sacrificing women.  They have invested their loans in their respective activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the mothers, M\u00e1xima Gonz\u00e1lez, sells fruit.  She goes very early to the supply places (Supply Market) where she takes her products to her customers.  She has a small stall on the edge of the street where she displays the products she has for sale.  Her customers are the people who pass through the area.  That is about M\u00e1xima. \r\n\r\nThe other members devote themselves to:\r\n1\r\nDominga Dur\u00e9\r\nVegetable and clothing sales\r\n2\r\nMirian Ca\u00f1ete\r\nEmployee\r\n3\r\nMa.

He also comments that the service he offers is very profitable because it brings in considerable profits which have helped him to save money and buy a used motorcycle which he wants to repair to put it to work. In addition, in the future he plans to open a spare parts store in addition to an auto shop to be able to help his taxi driver colleagues.

Olga who is 53 years old, and her siblings Tatiana, 16, and Jonathan, 15, in their cozy rented house which is located in a tranquil zone of the central jungle of Peru. For the past 4 years she has been selling general necessity products, and in parallel working in agriculture. She grows coffee, bananas, and citrus fruits. In both activities she helps her mother and her in laws who work with great care to obtain the greatest quantity of product which they then sell at a good price at the wholesale market at their city. Mayra believes that the activities she does are very profitable because they allowed her to pay for her secondary studies and she currently lives without worries.

They have been improving their business with time.  This time we will get to know members Celina and Susi a little better.\r\n\r\nCelina continues to work despite her 66 years.  It wasn't easy for her to educate her eight children.  She had to become responsible for them at the age of 33 when her husband died.  She managed to get along walking from place to place selling fish, mussels and fruit out of a basket.  To do that she got up very early, at three in the morning, to buy what she needed in the wholesalers' market.  She sold her merchandise to her neighbours and people who lived in her area, with the blessing of God.  As Celina tells us, people helped her because they knew of her needs.  She has a small market garden growing passion fruit and mangos.  She needed the capital it gave her for investment in fertilizer, grafting plants and seeds.  The children were growing up and needed higher education.  It was in this way that she worked very hard to bring up her family, that they wouldn't be missing the things they needed, and also so she could buy her land and build on it.\r\n\r\nDespite her illness that was diagnosed a few years ago (diabetes and arthrosis), she continues working in her market garden.  She doesn't want to cause expenses for her children who have families, because for her this would be incomprehensible.  The loan that Mrs. Celina is requesting is for purchasing seeds and fertilizer for sowing apples and avocados.\r\n\r\nSusi is 36 years old.  She and her husband have a carpenter's shop which they were able to set up with the short-term jobs they had, acquiring some basic tools and other tools were made by her husband.  Susi prepared the flat roof of their house, which they currently rent, as the workshop for the carpentry business.  Most of the jobs they do are shelving, chairs and tables.  This business is the family's livelihood.  It needed a large investment to purchase a router, a drill, primer and wood, which were obtained with the loans they received.  They have orders for cupboards, a dining-room set and chairs, for which they don't have the capital in order to serve their customers, and in this way to continue being the economic support for their household.  What they are thinking of doing in time is to purchase some land to build their own house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heidi Petersen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":459761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizer for the cultivation of avocados and apples.

For a long time she has become involved in different jobs with the goal to give her family a good start in life.  Four years ago, she decided to study in a small crafts workshop and now it is her job and she makes decorations in dresses using beads and other materials to give a better finish to the clothing.  Currently, she has 6 friends that help her in the work, since the orders that Cervandicia receives are many and keeping count of the dresses to decorate them is difficult, and she cannot do it alone; it is because of this that she offers a commission to her friends so that they can help her with the job and she has divided the workload equally amongst each friend.  For Cervandicia, her work gives her a lot of satisfaction since it allows her to distract herself and meet new friends.

The thirteen members are very hard-working women who try to progress through their businesses.  Many of them are the source of economic support for their home.  We met Anita and Gladis, who told us about their experiences as microbusinesswomen.  Anita is 38 and is a single mother.  She started to work five years ago making decorations for the home out of materials like ribbon, satin ribbon, and macram\u00e9.  She also makes wallets and sandals.  She bought these materials on credit at the beginning because she didn't have enough capital to invest in them.  She sold her products to her siblings, aunts and uncles, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances.  She used the loans she received later to buy glue, different colored thread, ribbons, yarn, ties for bags, silicone, soles for sandals, accessories to make wallets, bathroom decorations, flowerpots, corner protectors for furniture, and little angels and Santas for Christmas.  She took a silverwork class a year and a half ago with the goal of designing earrings, rings, bracelets, and necklaces to increase her income.  Later on she bought a digital scale that she needed for her business.  She needs this loan to invest in natural stones, silver thread by the gram, pliers, and accessories to make her pieces out of silver.<p>\r\nGladis is 57.  When she was 25, she bought some fabric remnants to make baby clothes.  She used her creativity to make lovely designs with the only goal of supporting her husband with the costs of raising their children.  The desire to learn to make other items led her to study courses in crafts, chocolate, and other subjects.  This is how she learned to make chocolates, stuffed animals, and canvas shoes that she sold to her friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and family members.  She had the goal of supporting her home and educating her grandson that she has been caring for since he was young.  She will use this loan to buy dulce de leche, dried fruit, chocolate, wrappers, and molds to make chocolates.  She will also buy beauty products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":459795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy materials for their businesses making home decorations and chocolates","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crisalida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Xenia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Dariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jhaqueline Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7100,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1775},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":619.1,"local_amount":1776,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064617,"comment":null},{"amount":618.4,"local_amount":1774,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1781,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899676,"comment":null},{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":1775,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1782,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933759,"comment":null},{"amount":618.75,"local_amount":1775,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1782,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661353,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T02:08:25Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165666,"name":"Rolando Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Rolando V. es una persona muy alegre que se dedica a trabajar con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n para llevar el sustento a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.

Her ability allows her to save for the future because she wishes to grow her plants in greater quantity and she wants to open her own stall in the market to sell her crops.

They live in their own house, which is made from adobe (clay cobblestones), straw, and tile.  \r\n\r\nFor 26 years, with help from his wife, he has been growing potatoes, corn, and peas.

They then return home to prepare food for their daughters to go to school.  They later return to work until nightfall.  According to Hilario, there are many times that he and his wife do not return home, and they take advantage of the night to continue working.  Due to the climate changes, they do the most self-sacrificing work.  At the end, they have their recompense because the harvest is gratifying.  They get good earnings, which helps support their family.  To Hilario, agriculture represents his whole life.  He learned to farm when he was very small, and it has served him to get his family ahead.  That is why he hopes to later plant a larger quantity.  At the same time, he raises sheep, pigs, and three heads of cattle to later sell at a good price.  \r\n\r\nBeing a man who wishes to improve, he is asking for a loan with MFP.  This is his eighth loan.  The most important thing to him is to keep working with his colleagues in his communal bank.  He wishes to use the loan to buy various pigs to fatten.  In the future he wants to have a farm in order to sell pork in the wholesale market in his city.  There is a great buyers\u2019 demand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":459889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-29T02:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2520,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T05:19:43Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165684,"name":"Victoriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victoriana  tiene 31 a\u00f1os y vive con Miguel de 45 a\u00f1os, con quien desea tener un hijo pronto, por lo que buscan estabilizarse econ\u00f3micamente, habitan en una casa que es alquilada.Desde hace un a\u00f1o y medio se dedica a la cocina ; trabaja en un restaurante en una zona comercial y en ese lugar  aprendi\u00f3  todos los secretos para atender a los mas exigentes comensales, considera que la venta de comida es bastante rentable; Victoriana no gana lo suficiente, pero si le alcanza para su manutenci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s cuenta con el apoyo econ\u00f3mico de su esposo, quien se dedica a realizar servicio de transporte en un motocarro en la ciudad, se ha dado cuenta que el negocio de comida  es bastante rentable, por lo que desea aperturar un restaurante de comidas t\u00edpicas de la selva del Per\u00fa, adem\u00e1s de comprar un motocarro , y brindarlo en alquiler ; tambi\u00e9n tiene planeado comprar un inmueble en la ciudad, en una zona c\u00e9ntrica y construir su casa para instalar ah\u00ed en el negocio de venta de comida.Es el primer pr\u00e9stamo que  tiene con MFP y sabe que pagar\u00e1 puntualmente sus cuotas porque es muy responsable.El dinero del pr\u00e9stamo, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de un motocarro  y brindarlo en alquiler para obtener mayores ganancias.","en":"Victoriana is 31 years old and lives with Miguel, who is 45, and with whom she would like to have a child soon.

Victoriana does not make enough, but she can support herself and in addition she can count on the financial support of her husband who offers the service of transportation in motocar in the city.

C. makes sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. Married to Angel C., a carpenter, they are blessed with nine children.  She earns money so their family can have a better life.  Rosita has two businesses: she has made curtains for 10 years and has operated a food cart as a vendor for more than three years.\r\n\r\nRosita is a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT).  She attends their weekly meetings and pays her dues consistently.  Because of her good repayment performance, she was able to borrow a sixth time from CCT.  The reason she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed to buy Filipino finger foods to resell.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.

Eva is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Eva from PMPC.

L., 35, wants nothing more than for her children to have a bright future. She is married to Orlando L., a factory worker, and they are blessed with one child who is studying in grade school. Rowena makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own variety store for three years.\r\n\r\nRowena joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) in 2008. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used all the money she borrowed as added capital for her store business. Her business now lets her earn a net profit of PHP 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, Rowena would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be used mostly as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying sacks of rice, charcoal, soft drinks and other household commodities for her store.\r\n\r\nRowena dreams that her variety store will continue to grow and become a grocery so that they will have enough savings for the college education of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

B., 49, wants nothing more for her business except to acquire more customers.

Her business is selling homemade hamburgers and selling snacks.\r\n\r\nSoraida has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow nine times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed as capital money for her burger stand. Her business now lets her earn a net profit of PHP 3,620 per month.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, Soraida would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying bread, and hamburger patties for her business. The profits that she will earn from her business will be saved so that she can use it for house repairs.\r\n\r\nSoraida dreams that someday she can have a bigger burger stand and a restaurant. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":455628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bread and hamburger patties for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4266.64,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4330.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118055476,"comment":null},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2165.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123890173,"comment":null},{"amount":11.67,"local_amount":533.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":541.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923910,"comment":null},{"amount":11.66,"local_amount":533.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":541.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923911,"comment":null},{"amount":11.67,"local_amount":533.38,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":541.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923912,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T09:11:10Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165704,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida G., 44, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs.

is a 48-year-old single mother who lives with her two children in Chingeltei district, Ulaanbaatar city, which is the capital of Mongolia. She lives together with her family in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. She has two gers. She lives with her youngest daughter in one of them and her oldest son lives with his family in the other one. Oktyabr operates a grocery trading business in her town. She sells a variety of products such as vegetables, fruits, canned products and so on. Oktyabr started her business in 1995 in a rented stall at a local market called \"Bumbugur\".

P. is from the town of Cristo Rey, Capas, Tarlac.

Irma has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Irma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Irma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Irma is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Irma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is 30 years old and lives with her husband and 1-year-old infant in Arkhangai province, Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Baigalmaa operates a retail Russian candy business in her town. She began her business in 2008 with working capital of 500,000 tugrugs (~350 USD). After several years of operation, she has managed to establish herself in the business community.

is one of FATEN\u2019s first clients. She took several loans from FATEN within its group guarantee program, and the last three loans as individual loans. She started with a 150 USD loan and gradually increased her loan size, but the loan was always very small so that it met her ability for repayment and her business size.\r\n\r\nKatey is married with three children. She and her husband have owned and managed an olive-wood workshop for twenty years. They buy the olive wood and make crosses, statues, Christ caves and many other Christian religious handcrafts. They sell them to souvenir shops in Bethlehem as well as to wholesalers who export them to the USA and Europe.\r\n\r\n In the Palestinian territories there is no national currency and there are three main currencies used: US dollars, Israeli Shekels and the Jordanian Dinar. Katey has requested a loan of 405 Jordanian Dinars (1 USD=0.71 JOD).\r\n\r\nKatey appears in the photo at her workshop. Last August, Katey\u2019s photo taken at her workshop was used for a FATEN billboard media campaign throughout the West Bank.

H. is from the village of Acad, Aurora Zamboanga Del Sur.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste and boost food in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Erlinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<p>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 14,400 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying ingredients like sugar, sticky rice and milk for making assorted rice cakes.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow so that she can sell her products in different markets as a wholesale vendor.   \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 18,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital for expanding her business by buying different food ingredients and seasoning for the food that she sells in her food stand.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that one day her mini food stand will become a restaurant for their family business. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Noneluna has been engaged in her business for over 9 years with approximate average monthly earnings of 3,000 PHP from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Noneluna joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noneluna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  Noneluna is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Noneluna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, especially the education of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her husband is a farmer and laborer and earns less than 5,000 PHP a month. With this condition it is difficult for the couple to support their large family. She decided to engage in the business of selling \u201cdayok\u201d , a salted fish appetizer. The earnings she has made has helped them meet the family's needs. \r\n\r\nShe joined PAGLAUM MPC early this year because she is very much interested with their their services. As a newly recognized member, she has earned the privilege of making a loan amount of 4,000 PHP. She will ad this to her working capital for her existing business. Her future plan is to expand her market by selling products to nearby towns.

The workshop employs a carpenter, a machinist to operate the heavier saws and five apprentices.  They make both ready-to-use furniture for clients, but also do work for other carpenters in the neighborhood who do not have electric saws.  Ms. S. explains it takes about two weeks to complete a bedroom set (bed, night tables and armoire).  Problems with electricity blackouts are a daily headache, but still business is decent.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 200,000 FCFA Ms. S. will purchase materials (wood, paneling, glue, etc.) to have on hand for their work.  This is Ms. S.'s first credit, though she has been a member of the bank since 2005.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The festival is in mid-October in honor of the Virgen del Monte. The majority of the population works in milk production. They are friendly and generous people, disposed to fighting to find a better quality of life and give the best to their families.\r\n<p>\r\nGloria P\u00e9rez has been a member of the bank for five years. Her sister-in-law, who now lives in Spain, invited her to join. She is 49 years old and lives in the Victoria del Portete neighborhood with her husband, who works as a carpenter, and their five children who are 25, 23, 21, 17, and 16 years old.  Her first three children are studying in the State University and the younger two are in Febres Cordero high school. Thanks to their joined efforts, they were able to construct a home that is small but theirs.\r\n<p>\r\nGloria works sewing colorful skirts, as her brother taught her. She has worked in this for thirty years and finds her customers in various parts of the city, often through acquaintances or recommendations from her customers. Also, she works raising chickens, which she has done her whole life. Her birds are sold in the city or by order.  With this loan, she will invest in the purchase of fabrics to continue with her sewing. Her goal is improve her home, little by little.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria Roselia P\u00e9rez is 51 years old. She is another active member of the bank and has been for five years since a companion invited her to be in the group. She lives in the neighborhood of the same name as the communal bank with her two sons, 29 and 22 years old. The elder is a mechanic, and the younger studies in SECAP (professional school). Her husband died a year ago, and they tell us that it doesn\u2019t affect them too much, because they were not living together. During their matrimony, they were able to construct their own adobe home.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria works in domestic services every day, but also works raising animals such as chickens and guinea pigs that she sells in the community since the markets don\u2019t pay a fair price. With this loan, she will purchase chickens, corn, vaccines and organic soil for her fields. Her dream is to improve her home little by little to have a better quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

Four are of legal age and one is a minor. For a living he transports heavy loads to Costa Rica and Central America. He started his business 33 years ago, previously he transported with a pickup truck and later he bought a truck and with time and much effort he saved money and bought a boxcar which he presently uses. He is requesting a loan as he wants to buy two tires No. 120020 as the tires of the boxcar are in bad condition. The biggest challenge he has faced as a businessman, was the loss of his daughter who passed away several years ago. Nevertheless this has helped to unify his family.

She won the bid to establish her business there four years ago and has worked hard to make it a success.  Her caf\u00e9 is well-equipped and opens early so that she can begin serving doctors, nurses, and others who are looking for something tasty and healthy to eat.

She lives in the house that she inherited from her parents with her three children: 10 year-old Filomena, 5 year-old Yeferson, and 2 year-old Yerson, who are the motivation for all her efforts.  Every morning Juana leaves with her cart to sell the delicious quinoa juice which she prepares (hot juice, made of a base of liquified quinoa, cornstarch, and apples).  The hot drink that she prepares is often requested by her customers, as the low morning temperatures encourage people to drink something hot to warm their bodies.  The thing she likes the most about her work is that she can drink all the juice she wants when she is hungry.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for 6 years and she considers the most difficult thing to be to have to wake herself up early and go out in the cold streets to sell.  In the future, she longs to have a store where she can sell with more tranquility and better serve her customers.  This is the first loan that Juana is requesting from MFP and she feels very confident that she will be able to make her payments on time, as she does not want to cause problems in her community bank, where she is very well liked, as she is one of the happiest members.

She lives in a rented house along with her two children: Antony, who is 11, and Candy, who is 2 years old.  She wants to give them a good education.  Martina has an itinerant business selling clothing; each day she goes through public and private institutions in her city looking for customers who want to buy something that she sells.  She brings the clothing from another city, and for this reason the fashions that she sells are very new and eye-catching.  What she likes most about her job is advising her customers about the clothing styles that are in fashion.  She has been carrying out this activity for 3 years, and she considers that the most difficult part is to have to walk all day in search of customers.  In the future, she hopes to have sufficient money to open up a store where she can sell at her leisure with greater comfort.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she is ready to work very hard in order to make her payments.  In her communal bank she is very well liked, since she always brings a lot of happiness to the meetings.

is married and has no kids. He is a 31-year-old trader. He lives with his wife in a rented apartment in a community in the western region of Ghana. He trades in garment tie dye material. Tie dye is designed from the combination of plain white cloth soaked in mixed dye to get the actual design. Tie dye is very useful and beautiful, so many people purchase it. The fabric can be sewn into African wear and it can also be used to sew a traditional style of clothing. Benjamin treks to Takoradi to buy his stock of goods.

Her husband's income alone only covers their home's basic expenses.  Like every mother, her dream is that her children have a better life than their parents.  She used to start selling very early.  At the beginning, she didn't sell much, but this changed in time because the location where she sold became a bus stop with a lot of buses heading towards towns in the Peruvian mountains.  She used her first credit to buy merchandise for her business (cookies, soft drinks, candies, snacks, etc.), and she used her profits to pay for the higher education costs of her children as well as food.  She also renovated her kiosk.  She needs a loan to buy soft drinks and candy.<p>\r\nNorma is married and is the mother of 3 children who are still under her care.  When she was 20, she would take the train that passed by that went to Huancayo.  She did this early in the morning to make the most of selling fruits that she packaged in her house and put in a basket.  She remembers that she did this when she was a girl to help her grandmother who raised her.  In the afternoons, she also went out to sell peaches, mandarins, and apples to the passengers on the train that went to Lima.  So she sold all of her merchandise while her sister-in-law watched her children.  She did this because her husband didn't have a steady job, and her desire to give the best to her children motivated her to work.  On the weekends, she prepared sweets (pudding, donuts, arroz con leche, etc.) and dishes such as chicken, guinea pig, and pachamanca (a traditional dish where meat and vegetables are baked in the ground with hot stones).  She sells this food to people in her community and at festivals in towns in the mountains.  She makes enough money to educate her children, to improve her home, and to buy some things for their home that they didn't have before.  She has used the loans she has received to buy supplies for her business.  She also used it for an operation she had on her gallbladder and for medicine because she does not have insurance.  She needs this loan to be able to purchase supplies.  Her profits will help her pay for the education of her youngest daughter, who is 14.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":460489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Marianela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia Ada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizavet Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Alex ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bety Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10300,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2575},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2575},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2575},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2575}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2575,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2592,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064625,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":2575,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2592,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899684,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":2575,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2592,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933767,"comment":null},{"amount":900,"local_amount":2575,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2592,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:38Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165913,"name":"Fausta Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fausta es socia del Banco Comunal Fraternidad.\nFausta es conviviente, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Fausta tiene una bodega en su casa en donde vende abarrotes, bebidas, golosinas.

She lives close to her family in Cayalt\u00ed District, located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years she has had a small grocery store set up in her house.  She sells basics necessities (rice, sugar, oil) and groceries to her neighbors and to the customers who frequent her store.  Additionally, she offers a food service to the various lodgers and tourists in the area.  Her business is welcomed thanks to her good nature and her talent for cooking.  \r\n\r\nLivia finds herself, for the first time, requesting a loan of 1000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa, which she plans to invest in the purchase of more groceries so she can expand her business. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to provide her daughter with a quality education.  She is a responsible mother and always works to get ahead in spite of her difficulties. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":460613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of groceries for business expantion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Livia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":68.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":70.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":76.26},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":76.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":84.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":95.51},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":98.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.09,"local_amount":68.83,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":69.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065244,"comment":null},{"amount":24.54,"local_amount":70.11,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":70.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900341,"comment":null},{"amount":26.69,"local_amount":76.26,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":76.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934499,"comment":null},{"amount":26.9,"local_amount":76.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":77.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662113,"comment":null},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":79.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694819,"comment":null},{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":81.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877871,"comment":null},{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":84.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617915,"comment":null},{"amount":30.01,"local_amount":85.74,"processed_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":86.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832323,"comment":null},{"amount":31.65,"local_amount":90.42,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":91.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098943,"comment":null},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":286.72,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":289.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T23:03:05Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165935,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria C.

B. is from the village of Catarman.

Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Myrna joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the 16th loan taken out by Myrna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
