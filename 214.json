It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

A. is an entrepreneurial woman who has worked very hard at the various jobs she has learned over the years. Seven years ago, she decided to stay in the business of raising cattle and sheep. After many years of hard work and dedication, Bahronjon can now see the fruits of her labor. The number of her animals has increased rapidly and they keep getting bigger and more beautiful. She dreams of eventually becoming one of the best cow exporters in the local market. To achieve this, Bahronjon needs to improve her operation.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Three of their children are presently studying in college and the youngest is still in high school. Judy is working hard to earn more income to help support the studies of their children.\r\n\r\nHer husband is operating a tricycle transport business to earn income while Judy ventures into vending. She sacrifices most of her time to sell food, snacks, fruits and vegetables. She also sells food & snacks on public utility buses and at the bus terminals. Her daily vending is worth the sacrifice because she has many customers, says Judy, and this helps develop her business activity further. Judy is asking for a loan of PHP 5,000.00 ($125 US) which she will add to her current vending capital. Judy is also hoping that somehow, this will allow them to be able to expand their livelihood for the welfare of their children.

Pedrico is very thankful that his family has a good family relationship, and his wife is very loving and supportive of him.\r\n\r\nPedrico is requesting to avail a loan of PHP10,000 ($225 US) that will be utilized for his rice farm. According to Pedrico, this amount will enable him to avoid asking for credit from lenders in their town, who charge high interest rates. He believes that joining ASKI (the lending partner) will be of great help towards the growth of his farming. With the loan, he will be able to pay for farming supplies such as fertilizers, seeds, labor compensations, and other expenses.  \r\n\r\nPedrico, being a father of two children, is dreaming that his children will someday finish their studies in college. This is why he works so hard. He also hopes to be able to save more money from farming to pursue the business of hog-raising that his wife has done previously.

Supplies are gotten from inland locations, in the city of Sokod\u00e9 to be precise, because charcoal is less expensive there.  She is married and the mother of three.

is married and has two daughters who are 19 and 13 years old.

Yuryi knows his customers\u2019 preferences and always offers them only good quality groceries. He has been in the grocery trade for about 7 years. His business has been marked with consistent stability. Currently, his gross income is about 12,000 Hryvnia a month. \r\n\r\nYuryi is running a neat small grocery store. He is hoping to invest a loan of 7,000 Hryvnia in additional merchandise which will help him increase his turnover capital eventually. Yuryi has a vision for the expansion of his trade and we believe it will be helpful in his entrepreneurial endeavors. The loan will help Yuryi to persist, take small steps at a time and achieve success which we think will be absolutely inevitable.

She lives in a proper house and desire very much so to have a better quality of life.   Her business is metals and she has a shop where they mold and convert metals into useful structures, like sangucheros (trolleys, carts and tricycles, etc.)  In actuality, she has 3 workers laboring in the shop and they are the main assistants in the shop.\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing she likes about her job is selling the products because since it\u2019s her business she feels responsible to sell.  She\u2019s been doing this for 27-years, but the thing she likes least is molding the metals and transporting the resulting products as it\u2019s very heavy and tiresome.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the future, she hopes to make her business an integral part of the city of Juliaca.

the Dominican Republic. It is the northern limit of the Hato Mayor province with the Samana bay. From here, ferries transport passengers to Samana, which is a beautiful peninsula with many tourist attractions. Sabana de la Mar itself has good beaches and is the takeoff point to visit a rain forest national park, Los Haitises. Despite its potential for tourism, especially \"eco-friendly\" tourism, Sabana de la Mar is a very underdeveloped, sleepy town by the Atlantic Ocean.<br>\r\nEdwin has a small repair shop where he sells parts for vehicles. This is his very first loan and he hopes to buy enough motorcycle parts for his inventory. In small towns, motorcycles are the most popular transportation. But, the condition of the roads makes it hard for their owners to keep them in good shape. This has brought Edwin a good clientele that trusts him to find even the most difficult motorcycle part.<br> \r\nEdwin has three young children. They are ages 8 and 6, and the youngest is just two months old. Edwin is working very hard to make sure that his children do not lack anything, especially the little baby. He dreams of seeing them grow up in a house of his own. He would like to set up his auto repair shop in a space he will own. \r\nSome of the borrowers on this loan have already completed two loan cycles successfully with Esperanza International.<br> \r\nThis picture was taken at the Hato Mayor office. The young man at the very back and and the woman whose head is partially visible on his right are not members of the group.\r\nThank you for helping us support these

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main income-earner in the family, he says this business is profitable, not being subject to seasonality. With the help of his sons, Jura arises early each day, baking the lepeshka and bread together so that people will have fresh product on their tables for breakfast. He purchases all the ingredients such as flour, salt, and yeast in the local market and now requests a loan of 2500 Somoni for the term of 9 months to increase bread production to meet demand. Specifically, the loan will be used to purchase flour and coal for baking the \u201clepeshka\u201d.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

her own initiative, when Adolat was 23 she learned how to make traditional dresses using a sewing machine. This activity has made it possible for her to contribute to her family's income and satisfactorily meet the most urgent needs of her two small children. Every item of clothing Adolat produces is superior, and due to this her orders have markedly increased. She has some very large orders that would be impossible to fulfill if she didn't have an assistant. Her incredible energy, fortitude, and commitment to her clients drives her to offer them new and improved service. To this end, Adolat wants to speed up her dress production by purchasing more fabrics. To accomplish her objective, she is asking for a $500 USD loan to buy new modern fabrics and she promises to repay the loan in 12 months. With your help, you can make her dream come true. Adolat thanks you for your generous contribution.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a resident of the city of Khujand, district 12.  She has a sales location next to her home.  She sells food products.  Because of the far location of her district all the residents purchase products from Dilrabo.  Because she has a small premium on her products, Dilrabo has a lot of customers and sales are always brisk.  Her son helps her in her business; he purchases products together with his mother at the wholesale market.

She is 36 years old and lives in her own house, along with her 2 daughters, who are 9 and 2 years old. They are the reason for all her hard work. \r\n\r\nCatalina\u2019s business is fuel sales, which she does as a street vendor. She goes to work very early in the morning in search of customers, who have no doubts about buying from her due to the affordable prices she offers. She is a very persuasive salesperson and almost always returns home with her containers empty. What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers. She has been doing this for 10 years and the most difficult part is having to be in the street all day, putting up with sudden changes in the weather. Even so, she knows she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. She hopes eventually to have a store where she can sell her fuel in more comfortable conditions. \r\n\r\nCatalina is in her second loan from MFP.

What she enjoys the most about her work is selling her product, and ending the day with her predicted number of sales.  She has been doing this activity for 8 years, and the most difficult part is staying in her stall all day without leaving.  For the future, she hopes to grow her business to improve her income.  She knows the road to get to her goals is long and will require sacrifices, but she is prepared to take it.  This is Elicia\u2019s second loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to make her payments on time.  She is a very responsible member of her cooperative bank, and she always enjoys the reunions.  She plans to use the 1500 soles she is requesting to buy more coca leaves, so she can increase the amount of product she has to sell.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":316216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-10T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596220,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990498,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211609,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641130,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":259.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080570,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":259.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996695,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T07:22:32Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":107070,"name":"Silvia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia  es socia del Bancomunal Juan Pablo II\nSilvia es separada tiene 46 a\u00f1os, dos hijos de 14 y 13 a\u00f1os que est\u00e1n en la escuela estatal.\nSilvia empez\u00f3 vendiendo a puerta cerrada, gaseosa y cerveza, despu\u00e9s de un a\u00f1o decido abrir su casa poniendo una bodega para esto compro un mostrador, y m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda.\nSilvia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles para la compra de mercader\u00eda para su bodega, gaseosas y productos de belleza. \nDesde que est\u00e1 en Finca aprendi\u00f3 a invertir el dinero que llega a sus manos y a ser puntual con sus pagos.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Silvia es poner un spa de u\u00f1as y masajes.\n","en":"Silvia is a member of the Juan Pablo II cooperative bank.\r\n\r\nSilvia is separated, 46 years old, and has two children ages 14 and 13 that are in the public school.\r\n\r\nSilvia started selling sodas and beer behind closed doors.

One meal is around $2 USD because local residents cannot spend a lot to eat out. However, she has many repeat clients. Besides running a cafe, she also runs a retail business selling meat.

Mumtaz baji is the mother of three sons and all of her children are enrolled in the local neighborhood school.  Mumtaz baji pays their school fees from the money she earns from her knitting business. Her husband runs a sanitary supplies selling business and has done so for 10 years now.  Mumtaz baji successfully repaid her first two loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan).  Now she is applying for a loan to buy sanitary supplies like pipes and taps to help expand her husband\u2019s sanitary business.\r\n\r\nMumtaz baji is the leader for this group loan which includes four other women from her locality.  The loan will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.  Bushra begum baji wants a loan to buy and sell sand. Safia baji will buy more products for her grocery store.  Nasreen baji plans to replace the body of her auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle), and Bashiran baji wants a loan to buy scrap for her scrap business.  The members of a group loan mutually guarantee one another's loans.  If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":316354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"To
