Azizkan works as a teacher in the local school. Her husband is a forest ranger. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,  Azizkan started her cattle breeding business in order to make more money for her family.

In order to further develop her business, Azizkan contacted Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som to purchase additional livestock.

Regina is 20 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past four years, Regina has been working hard to manage her small business which makes and sells cassava flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Regina has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more cassava and will help Regina to generate greater profits and improve her family's welfare. Regina hopes that in the future she will be able to start a big retail shop. \r\n\r\nRegina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has improved Regina's future prospects by helping her to learn more about herself and how to improve her relationship with her husband.

Heriberto is a businessman and has an internet cafe which is his main source of income. This business allows him to take care of his family as he is the sole breadwinner in the family. He is a very enterprising man who has known how to manage the internet business and combine it with other services such as photocopying and primarily video games. This business is very profitable and every day more people seek out his services. Thanks to his professional attitude to work he has managed to earn the trust of many people in the area, who with each passing day prefer his services more. Lately he has noticed that the video games attract a lot of people mainly young people and children who love spending time being entertained by the different games he offers. This has led him to take the decision of asking INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in the purchase of an LCD screen and a Play Station 3 in order to attract more young people and children who frequent his business most often. In this way he hopes to increase his revenue so that he and his dear wife can continue to live in acceptable living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.03,"image":{"id":941216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an LCD screen and a Play Station 3.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heriberto Ulises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":48.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":52.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":63.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.76},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.62,"local_amount":96.62,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116172,"comment":null},{"amount":44.41,"local_amount":44.41,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":44.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T01:38:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368900,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":205,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy hardware.

She lives with her husband and their children in Wayerma I, one of the neighborhoods at the outskirts of the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nOver seven years ago, after running several businesses unsuccessfully, Fatoumata Modibo started this business buying and selling clothes, beauty products and other various items.  She runs her business out of the large market in Sikasso.  Now, she wants to take advantage of this loan from Soro Yiriwaso to become a large-scale saleswoman in the market she works in, in order, ultimately, to better satisfy her customers, most of whom are women.\r\nShe is on her fifth individual loan cycle.  All her previous loans were fully paid back.\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying 8 outfits of embroidered fabric, 8 boxes of various sorts of ointments, 10 womens\u2019 handbags, 5 boxes of various types of perfume, 5 boxes of deodorant, 5 boxes of beauty soap, 10 pairs of shoes and newborn outfits.

She buys wholesale on-site with farmers attending the market, and then sells retail to foreigners and stallkeepers in the city.  \r\nShe plans on using this loan to generate monthly profits of 100,000 CFA francs, which will go largely towards contributing to the family\u2019s expenses and paying interest on her loan, with any remaining funds being re-invested into her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":65,"image":{"id":941263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase yams","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283268,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T16:45:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368936,"name":"Ricardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ricardo, a married 58-year-old resident of the Philippines, has operated a pigpen that sells grown pigs for the past 10 years.

She lives with her husband and their children in a large traditional family in Fama, the downtown area of  Sikasso. \r\nAfter having unsuccessfully tried many businesses, Salimata learned how to make traditional soaps (black soaps) approximately six years ago, from a neighbor. She runs her business out of her family home in Sikasso where her products are highly sought after by her clients for their quality. \r\nTo satisfy her ever-growing clientele, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. After successfully reimbursing 5 loans, she is applying for her 6th individual loan. \r\nWith this loan, she will purchase 20 barrels of cottonseed oil (used oil), 10 bags of soda ash and 6 wheelbarrows full of firewood. After making soap from used cottonseed oil and soda ash, she sells them retail to a clientele of mostly local women.\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn a monthly income of 275 000 XOF, which will be used mainly to grow her business capital, contribute to family expenses, and pay the interest on her loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":205,"image":{"id":941270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase used cottonseed oil and soda ash ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283270,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50488.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T17:27:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368942,"name":"Zilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zilda, 40, is married with four children, all of whom attend school.

She lives in the town of Malambo with her husband and 9 year old son. She has a variety store in her house, where she sells women's accessories, paper products, beauty items and other merchandise, according to the season. Her enterprising experience began 15 years ago, when, using her creativity, she started her business. She made artisanal crafts with her own hands, taking advantage of the fact that her spouse worked in a store. He made commercial contacts in the small communities nearby and built their own clientele. Finally, less than 2 years ago, when her husband stopped working in the store, they invested his severance package in a variety store. They mixed their own products and various merchandise. They started selling via orders and later sold according to each season. \r\n\r\nDilsa's creativity knows no limits, nor does her desire to learn. Besides making products out of materials such as leather, she also learned to make sandals, which she displays in her store with much pride. Her business is growing gradually, because her clientele has expanded. This is the reason why she has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy toys, taking advantage of the Christmas season. Usually she has a lot of orders from her customers, especially for toys, given to children for the birth of the Christ child. They receive them with much joy and they play in the streets of town. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.76,"image":{"id":939881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy toys","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":75798},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80063},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81931},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83843},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85799},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87801},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89850},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91946},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94092},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96287},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":98534},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":104056}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":75798,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":78491.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188777,"comment":null},{"amount":43.03,"local_amount":80063,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82908.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324982,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T16:02:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":368974,"name":"Procina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Procina is 31 years old and lives in the Philippines.

","en":"Maribel, age 42, lives in a neighborhood located in the south of the city with her husband and 4 children, ages 5 to 23.  There, she is engaged in the sale of varied merchandise, especially perfumes and clothing in all styles.  In order to fill her orders in the competitive market in which she participates, Maribel is applying for a Kiva loan.  This is the first financing she has sought from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domino.  With it she will buy clothing in which her customers will be very elegant at the year-end parties.\r\n<p>\r\nMaribel began her business more than 11 years ago.  Initially she sold few items, but gradually she added new products.  In addition, she was able to get new suppliers who, thanks to her sister\u2019s representative account number, provided her with guides or catalogues which she could use to promote sales to customers.  Her customers are primarily workers in businesses and neighbors in the area where she lives with her family.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, it is very close to the season of great commercial activity during which sales increase and require a lot of inventory to respond to orders from her customers, which are at a greater volume than usual.  This is the reason why her plans for investment of the loan would be successfully for she would earn a little more from the rapid turnover of inventory and would respond to the expectations of increasing business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":92.53,"image":{"id":939915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a greater quantity of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":87807},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89856},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91952},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94098},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96294},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98540},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100840},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103193},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105601},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108065},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":110586},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":87807,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88127.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188778,"comment":null},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":89856,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90183.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T23:50:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369007,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is 37 years old and is married.

She buys them at one price and sells them at another obtaining good profits.  She also sells merchandise like clothes, creams and lotions, everything her customers ask for.  She sells based on prior orders.\r\n\r\nThis is the 9th loan she\u2019s asked ODEF for and she has repaid them very well.  She will use the present loan to buy corn and beans and another part of it to buy merchandise to fill orders placed by customers.

He also wants to give his children the legacy of a professional career so that they will not lack for anything when they are independent.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":76.86,"image":{"id":941522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to make improvements to his motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chincha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-11T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":102.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":110.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":117.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":126.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":131.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":136.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":142.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":148.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":154.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.65,"local_amount":98.21,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142501,"comment":null},{"amount":39.21,"local_amount":102.29,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":105.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271089,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T21:02:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369156,"name":"Gloria Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria, quiere surtir el negocio, por eso est\u00e1 solicitando nuevamente un pr\u00e9stamo, ya que estos le permiten realizar buenas compras y mejorar el inventario con la mercader\u00eda diversa para los clientes, comprar\u00eda mariscos frescos en pescado, filetes de tibur\u00f3n, entre otras especies marinas que son del consumo de los clientes.\nLas inversiones que Gloria ha realizado han sido provechosas ya que ha mantenido producto fresco.\n","en":"Gloria wants to stock her business, so she is requesting a loan again, since loans allow her to get good sales and improve her inventory with different merchandise for her customers.

She has 3 children and at this time is only taking care of the youngest, who is 14. Her other children are grown and aged 28 and 35. Juana lives and works in the city of Caman\u00e1, located in southern Peru, an extensive dry oasis in the Sechura desert of Peru, which dominates the coast in the Southwestern part of the country. Caman\u00e1 has been an important tourist destination historically. Nonetheless, the frequent strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the last decade  (an 8.4 in 2001 and 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroying the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1, costing a lot of jobs, ways of making a living and homes.  But a result of the unemployment is that it creates an environment ready for micro-finance. Micro-finance allows people who don't have a lot of resources and who have a small business to have an opportunity as a businessperson in the labor market. \r\n\r\nJuana started her business in the area of selling groceries (rice, sugar, milk, etc.). With the loan of S\/.2,000 that she will receive thanks to KIVA, Juana will be able to have enough money to be able to buy boxes of panetones. In Peru,  this product is traditionally eaten at Christmas dinner as a dessert. It is similar to fruitcake. She can sell them and improve her sales for the Christmas season. This loan helps Juana stay enthusiastic and keep thinking in the future, where she will continue with her business and build a roof over her kitchen.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":941532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy panetones (Christmas bread) and sell it for the Christmas season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T12:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":139.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":149.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":193.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":201.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":135.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":136.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142502,"comment":null},{"amount":699.37,"local_amount":1864.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1884.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-08T16:59:17Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369163,"name":"Jose Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, necesitan mejorar su vivienda, por eso solicita pr\u00e9stamo e invertirlo en ladrillo, cemento, arena, hierro, pago de mano de obra, con lo cual espera que hacer una reparaciones y construir un nuevo cuarto.

He sells meals, set meals and fast food among the other delights of Caribbean cuisine. He started out as an entrpreneur selling fish which he brought from Sucre, a municipality he used to live in before, to sell at the public market in the city of Barranquilla where he sold it at his brother-in-law's stall. Gradually he built up a large clientele and for this reason decided to move to Soledad, where he bought a plot of land and built his own house, looking for a way to not have to travel so much and pay more attention to his family. There, together with his wife, he started making meals and this is what he currently does and with which he has managed to take care of his family. Currently he is applying for his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which he will buy ingredients to make his food in larger quantities.
