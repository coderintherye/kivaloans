Ama is mother of six children. She cares for all the children their unemployed father abandoned. Her principle source of income that allows her to feed and educate the children is the farming and production of \"gari,\" the making of manioc into flour, which she sells at the local market. Currently, she wishes to dedicate her work entirely to the production of gari and other food-producing products, because of the large problem of cultivable land. The town is growing rapidly and the surrounding lands are sold to city-dwellers. It is because of this that she asks for a loan of $1000.00 which will be payed back in one year. She has already received small loans in the past and has re-paid them without difficulty, proof of her good organization and her expertise of her activity.<p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9e de 37 ans environs, Madame A.

Considering the social conditions of her family, few children have had the opportunity to attend school. Leonor finished primary school, and, after concluding her studies, Leonor moved to the city of Maputo where she resided with her oldest sister. In 1987, she started a business selling shellfish acquired from fishermen in the Catembe Municipal District. In 1992, she met a fisherman who in turn became her husband. Her and her husband continued to gamble on this business, having together acquired a boat; her husband had worked for a rented boat when they had first met. Right now, they hope to expand to 2 boats and 8 workers. This is a third loan; the first two were used for the purchase of a boat motor and fishing nets. With the current loan they intend to expand their business by increasing the number of new nets, consequently creating new jobs. Their business makes a great impact on: the couple\u2019s life, the income brought about by fishing supports a family of six people; and, the community, more than create jobs, they supply the city of Maputo with shellfish. In the future they hope to invest in the improvement of their living conditions. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Leonor Juli\u00e3o M., nasceu em Chokwe, prov\u00edncia de Gaza, filha de pai agricultores, dada a condi\u00e7\u00e3o social da fam\u00edlia  poucos filhos tiveram  possibilidades de estudar, tendo conclu\u00eddo apenas o ensino prim\u00e1rio.\r\nA pois a conclus\u00e3o do ensino prim\u00e1rio veio  Louren\u00e7o Marques a ent\u00e3o cidade de Maputo onde residiu com a irm\u00e3 mais velha.\r\n\r\nEm 1987, iniciou com o neg\u00f3cio de venda de Marisco, onde o produto era adquirido  aos pescadores no Distrito Municipal da Catembe.

Due to increasing pressures he discontinued his studies and has since sought a profession that can help him in the support of his family, especially after his parents\u2019 separation. In 1992, he began an apprenticeship as a mechanic. During these 3 years he also worked in the offices of Radio Mozambique. At the end of these 3 years, he began to work for himself, opening a small vehicle repair shop. In early 2006, he acquired a Land Rover from a friend and began to transport passengers from Catembe to Ponta de Ouro, 120 km from the city of Maputo. Right now, the Land Rover is disabled. With the loan Cristelo intends to repair his vehicle. His services are a positive contribution to the community. The route he operates lacks sufficient transport due to precarious road conditions. Only 4-wheel-drive vehicles like Cristelo\u2019s are capable of traversing these roads. Cristelo also has to account for an increase in rent and securing another job. A family of five, including himself, his wife and three children, are dependent on this business. In the future, he intends to improve his transportation services by obtaining a vehicle with greater passenger accommodation. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Cristelo A., jovem natural da catembe, cresceu com a m\u00e3e, frequentou a escola at\u00e9 a 8\u00aa classe, dada press\u00e3o da vida desistiu de estudar procurando desde ent\u00e3o uma profiss\u00e3o a qual podia ajudar no sustento familiar uma vez que os pais estava separados.\r\n\r\n Em 1992, iniciou com aprendizagem da mec\u00e2nica e tendo trabalhado durante 3 anos na oficina da R\u00e1dio Mo\u00e7ambique.\r\n\r\nPassado os tr\u00eas anos come\u00e7ou a trabalhar por conta pr\u00f3pria onde abriu uma pequena oficina de repara\u00e7\u00e3o de veiculos.

Right now, she has a small, rented commercial establishment where she sells grocery products. The neighborhood where she practices her commercial business has many difficulties in transportation. The people turn to her establishment for the purchase of groceries and other necessities.

He returned to Mozambique after the general peace agreement terminated a 16-year conflict and brought with him a truck allowing him to transport freight and passengers from Catembe to the South African border. He worked with this vehicle for many years, and it broke down at the end of 2000. Beginning in 2001 he worked as a driver, no longer self-employed. With the money earned as a driver we was able to purchase another smaller freight vehicle to transport freight from his small grocery store.

With the present loan he intends to repair the mini bus so that he can again transport passengers, a job he considers his forte. His transportation business has a positive impact on the community.

His wife sells prepared beans and earns very little to help support their family. <p>\r\n\r\nMr. A. is an energetic man with high moral standards who does all he can to meet his family's needs.

Today she is no longer totally dependent on her husband, and she can contribute more to the household income. She is a married mother of five children who also takes care of two of her husband's children. She is energetic and honest and has regularly repaid her first loan and is now requesting another. <p>\r\n\r\nThis new loan of $850 will allow her to sell jewelry, bracelets and other items at the markets in Cotonou and Accra. With her income she hopes to do more for her family and especially for her children.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e en 1976 \u00e0 Kladjem\u00e9, Madame G.

This very energetic young woman now manages her own shop with a discipline worthy of a highly experience business woman.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving an ever-increasing and demanding customer base, she is requesting a new loan of $1,200.  This new financing will allow her to establish a stock of hardware in order to meet the expectations of her customers on a timely basis.  Given her experience in this field of endeavor, this young woman deserves financial support, which will make her business even more worthwhile.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Essi Sanno A. est n\u00e9e le 1er ao\u00fbt 1976 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9.

After grade school he emigrated to Benin in order to learn to be a mechanic which he never practiced due to the lack of opportunity.  He is married and has two children.  He struggles daily to provide for the needs of his small family by doing odd jobs. His hopes lay in a new enterprise he undertook with his cousin selling parts to motorcycles and scooters.  Through this small business Mr. A. has acquired a significant amount of experience to open his own shop.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, for better or worse, his shop is able to stay open, but only through great difficulty.  This is why he is asking for a loan of $1200 to buy bulk quantities of loose motorcycle parts in order to better satisfy his customers.\r\n<p>\r\nGiven the courage, devotion and especially the experience of this young man, this loan will provide him with a \"second wind\" as he struggles to manage his shop and will enable him to improve his currently precarious economic situation.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Chlo\u00e9 Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

One of Pepeu\u2019s works was weaving fine mats that we always have to present during special events, like funerals & weddings. It\u2019s a very special treasure of Samoa. Nowadays we hardly find these treasures, and so women who do weaving are actually benefiting from it, through selling it. For a small size mat, which is about 2 meters long will cost up to US$20, and as the meters go on the price as well goes up. Not only its cost by meters, it\u2019s also it\u2019s priced for how they weave it, and you can imagine how hard it is to make.

She is a hairdresser by profession.  Her husband teaches part-time on a farm and makes $20 a month, which barely covers one day of family expenses.  Aware of the situation, she began a small business selling beauty products to make ends meet.  However, the lack of sufficient means, particularly working capital, poses a serious handicap to her deteriorating finances.  And this highly devoted and enterprising woman is becoming poorer and poorer as a result.

And so he is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy tubing and the necessary materials for an electrical installation, fertilizer, and other soil and farming supplies likely to make his business worthwhile.  The goal is to meet the every-growing demands of his customers and especially to increase his revenues.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nMa\u00e7on de profession, Monsieur A.

Lako Y., age 78, lives a life of subsistence ranching, raising a few heads of sheep and pigs in the village of Atcham\u00e9.  The purely heirloom livestock can be vulnerable to disease.  She is compelled to run her business herself to survive because there is nobody to take care of her.  She must reorganize her livestock business while taking into account veterinary care.  Then she may receive a good return on her investments and thus increase her income. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so Ms. Y. is requesting a loan of $850 as backing that is as much financial support as it is technical. We must remember that she repaid her previous loans without any problems.  The loan will serve to construct an enclosure to keep the livestock, to equip the enclosure, and to buy new livestock.  The funds will also ensure regular veterinary care, so that the animals may be raised in a healthful environment.

She has been a merchant of ice water for two years as her principal business, which does not quite generate enough income.  Using the daily \u00abtontine\u00bb system (a kind of group savings\/investment fund), she was able to secure loans, which have already been repaid.\r\n<p> \r\nConcerned about meeting the growing demand for ice water, Ms. A.  is requesting a loan of $850 to buy a freezer, some coolers, and to establish working capital.  With this financing, she will also diversify her business by producing fruit juice and by opening an eatery in order to cover expenses.  Thus, she can derive substantial income to address her own needs and those of her family.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nC\u00e9libataire de 30 ans, Mlle A.

She was born in 1959 and lives in an extended family.  Besides her five children that she supports, there are several people under her care and responsibility.

This will revitalize a business that she has been running for 20 years.  \r\nShe has been successful due to her long experience in her field of endeavor.  The loan will allow her to be better organized and to meet strong customer demand by augmenting her production of palm oil, as well as augmenting her revenues.

While she turns a profit, she does so with very limited means.  Today, she is requesting a loan of $550 to acquire more vegetable fields.  She can then assert herself in the marketplace, particularly during periods of shortage.  The loan will improve her revenues, as well as the living conditions of her family.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e \u00e0 un paysan depuis une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, Madame HOUKPATI Afiwagan est m\u00e8re de cinq enfants.

The demand for her charcoal is high, because this is the commonly used fuel in the slum. The fruits and vegetables, too, sell quite well. Also, the water-vending business is successful, since many residents do not have tap water at their homes. Still, Jane would like to increase her earnings to be able to provide all the necessities for her family. To achieve this, she intends to expand the scope of her business operations. She wants to open up more water taps and increase the stock of fruit, vegetables and charcoal. Jane is requesting a loan of US$1000: US$250 for buying and installing two water meters and pipes, and US$750 for purchasing more charcoal, vegetables and fruits. She is a business-focused woman and will definitely be able to repay the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":18221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase more water taps and more stock for her busness","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.316667 36.783333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":25,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":5914,"name":"Fiodjid\u00e9","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fiodjid\u00e9 D. was widowed about 12 years ago.

He was orphaned very early on, when his father died.  To take over the responsibilities for his younger brothers, he started farming, especially sugar cane.  Today, he has 10 years worth of experience in this domain and has reached a production level that proves his mastery of the business.  He now plans on growing crops in the off-season to meet market demands in his area.  Previous loans allowed him to grow his operation and to improve his crop yields through the use of herbicides.  Presently, the procurement of selected cuttings and the purchase of a motorized irrigation pump are his concerns for which he is requesting a loan of $950.  He can then increase his production.  Accomplishing these goals will offer him a degree of  financial stability that will allow his family to thrive and achieve its potential.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9 de 35 ans, Monsieur A.

He thus counts on Ms. Kokoe M. to take care of the household expenses. She is very energetic, kind and devoted and does everything she can to keep her family together. Thanks to her work experience, she has the ability to manage a loan and to repay it on time. She is requesting a loan of $800 to buy hair dryers and hairpieces in order to better satisfy her customers and earn a maximum profit. This loan will help her to improve her family's economic and social conditions.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e le 10 janvier 1975 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9fecture du Golfe, Madame M.

M. is 34 years. He is married and has one child. He also takes care of two of her sister\u2019s children, Millicent 18 years and Nelly 17 years, both in high school. He assists in paying their school fees. The sister succumbed to illness in the year 2004. She was not legally married.\r\n\r\nCharles only managed to get education up to high school level. Due to the increased unemployment in Kenya and lack of fees for college, he only managed to get a casual job in the juakali sector. Through this he learned various skills, including the spraying of cars. He worked in the garage for seven years. All this time he had been saving a bit of the little money he got as wages. It is while working at the garage that he together with his colleagues came up with the idea of opening their own garage. With their little saving and their varied skills, they managed to buy simple basic tools to start up. It is then that they opened Walsam garage at a road reserve near Fort Jesus in Kibera slums. They have been operating there for the last three years.\r\n\r\nCharles and his friends have had constraints in their tools at work. They have no spraying machine at the garage. They are forced to hire a machine at a cost of USD 7 for every vehicle they spray. Besides that, they have to book the machine a day in advance. Sometimes they do not get the machine, which forces the vehicles to stay longer at the garage, which often results in loss of business. A loan of USD 200 in kind, in form of a vehicle spraying machine will them to maintain more customers. He intends to train other boys within the Kibera slums on vehicle repair skills. This will reduce their chance of getting into crime and drugs as well as opening up for them employment opportunities. The loan is repayable within 12 \u2013 18 months.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":18523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle

Y. is 41 years old and is living with HIV within the Kibera slums. He is also a widower. He has three children and also takes care of three orphans who were left in his care by his brother who died due to HIV related complications.    \r\n\r\nIn the year 2004, Douglas was privileged to go through two days training on local manufacture of detergents and shampoo, which was conducted by the Methodist Church in Kibera. The training showed how and where to get the ingredients for detergent and shampoo making.  \r\n\r\nDouglas got $5 grant in kind from a friend, which he used to buy the ingredients he needed. He was able to make 20 litres of the detergent. He packed and sold this in plastic containers of 250 and 500 grams that he had collected from a nearby bar within Kibera for $1.50. He also decided to give samples of the detergent he had made to the neighboring organizations, schools and churches in order to advertise his products. It is now two years since he started selling the detergents and shampoo at Fort Jesus, Kibera. He has a wider market, ranging from his neighbors, the schools and churches within Kibera.\r\n\r\nDouglas uses a wooden stick and plastic containers (basins) to mix his ingredients. He produces 80 litres of the detergent and shampoo in a week and sells in small quantities. He packs in containers of 20, 10 and 5 litres which he sells to his clients in schools, churches and organizations. He also packs in containers of 100 \u2013 500 grams that he sells at an affordable price ($1.50) to his neighbors. He usually stores the little amount that remains in the plastic containers that he uses to mix the ingredients because of the shortage of storage containers.  \r\n\r\nDouglas sees that his business is expanding and has a wider market. Given the loan of $ 75, he plans to purchase 30 plastic containers of 20 litres each to enable him store and pack his detergents and shampoo. Douglas has recently been approached by a group of women and youth who have been sponsored by a health clinic within the Kibera slums, to teach them on the process of making the detergent and shampoo. Douglas sees this as a move that will not only increase his income but also positively impact his community, which is characterized by idleness especially among the youth. Douglas also plans to transfer this skill to his children.  The loan is repayable within 6 \u2013 12 months.

Antonio M., 42 years of age and a divorced mother of 3, lives with and assumes all responsibility for the health and education of her two grandchildren. Justina grew up with her parents and attended school; however, she found her studies interrupted by her early marriage. She worked for an automotive parts dealer, but her income was unable to sustain her obligations. Hence, she abandoned her job to take care of her own business in 2003. Today, she assumes full administration of a commercial business. Through her friends she came to know Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner) toward the end of 2006. With the loan, Justina intends to reinforce the volume of her business, responding to an ever-increasing demand. Her future goals are to grow and construct new strategies of survival. Justina hopes to increase her revenue, allowing her to reimburse the loan, make small savings and improve the conditions of her job.

Ernesto Z., 45 years of age and married, is a native of Homoine, Inhambane province. Due to an early marriage, he never attended school beyond the 7th grade. Once he discontinued his studies, he began to work for a civil construction company to help confront the great challenge of being a father at the young age of 16. Months later, once his contract ended, he started an unsuccessful firewood cutting business. He started selling cow\u2019s milk and raising chickens, an activity he continues to this day. Through conversations with friends he learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he became acquainted with and solicited a loan for the purchase of egg-laying hens. His income helps him support familial expenses, and his children\u2019s educational and health expenses, as well as invest in the construction of his house. With this loan he intends to buy hens to supply the market of Boane with fresh eggs, as well as sell chickens and milk. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one because beyond providing employment for himself, his wife, and children, he also plays an important part in the supply of animal protein, calcium and other vitamins derived from cow\u2019s milk, thus contributing to the essential nourishment of the community. His future goals include expanding his business and diversifying his products. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Z., de 45 anos de idade, casado, natural de Homoine, provincial de Inhambane.

A., 32 years of age and a native of Nampula, did not attend school beyond the 5th grade because of the war. He arrived in the province of Maputo in the company of his oldest sibling in 1995 and encountered the necessity of starting a small business in an ambulatory regime. Later, he acknowledged this endeavor as a good idea now that the conditions of starting a business had already materialized in a fixed location, also because he had married and needed to better organize his life. Today he is a father of 2 children. Through his neighbors he obtained information about the services provided by Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he approached and solicited an initial low-cost loan. He was able to open a bank account and start a small savings in case of an emergency. Right now, he employs 4 people and supports the basic familial expenses. With this loan he intends to expand his business by diversifying the products he sells. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one: he provides employment for himself, his wife and his sister-in-law; he places the product as close as possible to the consumers of his village. His future plans include expanding the business and offering employment to more people in the community. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Armando A. de 32 anos de idade, natural de Nampula por causa de guerra n\u00e3o conseguiu estudar para alem da 5 classe.\r\nChegou na prov\u00edncia de Maputo na companhia do seu irm\u00e3o mais velho em 1995 e viu a necessidade de iniciar um pequeno neg\u00f3cio em regime ambulat\u00f3rio mais tarde achou por bem e j\u00e1 criada as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fazer o neg\u00f3cio no local fixo tamb\u00e9m porque j\u00e1 tinha se casado e precisava organizar-se melhor.\r\n\r\nHoje \u00e9 pai de 2 filhos e conta que atrav\u00e9s dos vizinhos obteve a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os servi\u00e7os que a HLUVUKU ADSEMA presta \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Boane, tendo aproximado e solicitado o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo num valor bastante reduzido tendo em conta as capacidades de financiamento da institui\u00e7\u00e3o. \r\n\r\nConseguiu abrir uma conta banc\u00e1ria e come\u00e7ou a fazer pequenas poupan\u00e7as para os momentos de crise.
