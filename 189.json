Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is a mother of five children who runs a \u2018buy em, sell em\u2019 clothing business in the Bush Market. She also finds time to raise pigs. Alice lives in Nkwen where she sells her clothing. She will use her loan to purchase clothing to resell at the market and to buy piglets to raise. \r\n \r\nThis is Alice\u2019s sixth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2002. Her clothing business has been running since at least then and she knows her customer base well. She plans on changing locations with this new loan and understands what it takes to sell her clothes in a different market. \r\n\r\nHer past loans have gone into her clothing business. The profits from those loans have helped her buy textbooks for her children\u2019s education, as well as to pay for the farm\u2019s rent. This particular loan will help her to rent a new farm and buy fertilizer for it, as well as continue to fund her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nAlice has not had it easy living in poverty. Both she and, at times, her children have had to go without enough clothing.  She has also had to experience the death of her brother and sister. Alice stands strong, however, with her clothing business. She prefers to use GHAPE because the loan conditions work well for her. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":285707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

She will use her loan to purchase flour, yeast, groundnut oil, piglets and animal feed. \r\n \r\nThis is Pauline\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2004. Her fast food business has been running since at least then and she knows her customer base well. Her community will benefit by being able to have their breakfasts with no difficulty and less expense.\r\n\r\nHer past loans have gone into her clothing business. The profits from those loans have helped her buy textbooks for her children\u2019s education, as well as to pay for the farm\u2019s rent. This particular loan will help her to rent a new farm, buy fertilizer for it, and to continue to fund her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nPauline has not had it easy living in poverty. She has had to go without enough clothes and, at times, her children did, too. She has also had to experience the death of her brother and sister. Pauline stands strong, however, with her clothing business. She prefers to use GHAPE because the loan conditions work well for her. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":177108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase flour, yeast, groundnut oil, piglets and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Njembeng, Mile 18, Mbengwi, NW.

Her husband is working in Russia, as are many from her town. He sends home money to support the family, but the children are growing and to cover all the expenses Soima has a small business - selling children's clothing and shoes. At this time there is no permanent employment for women in the region, and that which there is is very low paying. Soima travels 170 kilometers from her home to the wholesale market to buy her goods. Having no permanent place to sell at, she travels between the area's markets. Sales are not great, but the profit covers the business's expenses with some leftover for the family. Soima decided to expand her business a little and came to Microinvest for a loan. She plans to use the laon to buy a new assortment of goods. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":285758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of new inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2300,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":346.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":360.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375.04},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":390.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":405.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":421.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.22,"local_amount":346.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":352.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015984,"comment":null},{"amount":97.99,"local_amount":360.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":366.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599712,"comment":null},{"amount":101.91,"local_amount":375.04,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":381.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994154,"comment":null},{"amount":106,"local_amount":390.05,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":396.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215435,"comment":null},{"amount":110.23,"local_amount":405.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":412.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644928,"comment":null},{"amount":114.65,"local_amount":421.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":428.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084481,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T10:23:11Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94160,"name":"Alfonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El sr.

Dentro del grupo existe  gente que se encuentra trabajando por primera vez bajo la modalidad de grupos solidarios pero aquellos que tienen experiencia garantizan el cumplimiento del resto del grupo ya que conf\u00edan en sus integrantes","en":"This group is represented by Mr. Carlos L. and is in its first loan cycle. None of the group members are related to each other. All of the members of the \u201cLa Exaltaci\u00f3n\u201d Microfinance Institute partake in different business activities, such as selling clothing, cosmetics, or food. Others are in carpentry, metal arc welding, or make pants. As in all businesses, competition always exists, especially when selling goods. That is where the quality of the product is top priority, along with the entrepreneur\u2019s experience in lowering prices and making deals with the customer. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise and supplies needed to improve the quality of their products, thus boosting profits and providing the group members\u2019 families with a better quality of life. Within the group we can find people who are working in a solidarity group for the first time, but the other members who already have experience in this field promise that the loan obligation will be met because they trust the rest of the members. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

He started the business 4 years ago because, at his age, he couldn't work.  He decided to set the grocery up in his house and a friend advanced him some money so that, little by little, he's building his business.  Don Nicasio's proposal is to stock a sufficient supply of products so that he can provide everyday items to his customers.

T., 31 years old, is married and is blessed with four children. She lives in Poblacion, Mahinog, Camiguin Province in Southern Philippines. Three of her children are in school and the eldest is in fourth grade. Their main source of income is the tricycle that they own. Her husband is the tricycle driver. (Tricycles are the mode of transportation in their province.) \r\n\r\nCurrently, their tricycle is not working due to problems with the wheels and some spare parts that are not functioning.

The inhabitants make a living mainly by farming and petty trades. Mrs. Tran Thi Trang is the group leader of Group 10 consisting of 5 members. She has 3 children. The eldest son had to leave school early to work as a construction worker to support the  family. The two daughters are going to school. Her husband is 49 years old. He is in a weak health condition but still works as construction worker to support the family. She wishes to borrow VND2,442,600 (about USD140) to buy fruits to resell. This is her third loan. The previous loans, invested in buying and reselling fruits, were fully paid on time. Everyday, she goes to the city to buy fruits such as oranges, mandarins, apples, mango, pears to resell. In the seasons not good for fruit sales, she switches to sell vegetables to earn some money to pay for living costs of the family and send her children to school. Other members of the group also request for the same amount of loan, as below:\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi Ha borrows to buy vegetables to resell\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi Thoi borrows to invest in a beverage and soft drink shop\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi Hue borrows to buy vegetables to resell\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Doi Thi Chien borrows to buy fishes and prawns to resell.\r\n\r\n <br

Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Komil has become a very successful businessman in a short time.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

mother of five and a widow, Cecilia has a shop in the market in Mbengwi where she sells various products.  With her fourth loan from GHAPE, Cecilia plans to purchase additional oil, plantains, egusi (a type of spinach), groundnut and salt. <P>\r\n\r\nHaving joined GHAPE in 2004, Cecilia has used her past loans for pig farming, and for buying and selling oil.  Since she sells products that are needed in her community and has experience as a business owner, Cecilia has many customers, and thus, her business in the market is doing quite well.<P>\r\n\r\nBecause of her success with the shop, Cecilia has been able to pay her children's school fees and to provide medicine for her family.  This new loan will continue to help Cecilia finance her children's education as well as to pay for health services and overall improvements in her family's standard of living.<P>\r\n\r\nAs a widow, Cecilia has faced adversity, but with the help of GHAPE and Kiva, Cecilia has persevered in creating a successful business, which allows her to provide a better life for herself and her five children.  She appreciates GHAPE because of the organization's easy repayment plan.<P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

A. is a 36-year-old nurse at the central hospital in the town of Isfara. Together with her husband, who is currently working in Russia, Muborak has raised three children. In addition, she has run a drug store for eight years, selling certified medicines. The drug store is located in the town center, so it attracts many customers. Muborak is requesting $600 USD to expand her business. With the consequent increase in income, she is planning to educate all of her children through higher education. Being very precise by nature, Muborak would like to assure lenders that she is able and ready to repay the loan in nine months. This loan will help her accomplish her goals in a short time. Your generosity can change lives.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nasibakhon is 39 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of three children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. \r\n\r\nNow she dedicates herself to raising and selling cows and sheep. With the income she generates, she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of $1000 USD for 9 months to buy more young cattle to sell when they are fully grown. With this investment, Mrs. Nasibakhon will be able to substantially increase her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after the country\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is a widow and has an adult son. Valieva has a successful flour-selling business at the local market in the town of Isfara, where she sells an assortment of high-quality sorts of flour. Because she buys the flour wholesale, her prices are cheaper than those of her competitors. For this reason, she has many customers who buy her flour straight from her house. Today, there is a great demand for her goods, which is why she wants to take an individual loan. She has requested a loan of $800 to add to her working capital and allow her to purchase more goods. She promises to repay the loan within nine months. Valieva is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve her goals and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe her perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in her small business.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has four kids who are all still in the basic school. Gladys lives with her husband and family in a community called Nkwaateng. Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite an appreciable number is also involved in trading and other business activities. Gladys is in the business of palm oil production. She has been in business for ten good years and is full of rich experience. \r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes them in her house to produce the oil and sells it at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from palm fruit which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel its water content. Gladys desires to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruit in bulk to be able to supply to more customers. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve larger market and eventually, help improve her family finances.

These schools, WCSL Mabanta and WCSL Makama, were established by the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone. Since both schools from the villages of Mabanta and Makama operate on the same payroll, they have merged to seek a loan from Kiva through SMT.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be the second loan WCSL Mabanta will be receiving from Kiva through SMT. The previous loan that WCSL Mabanta received from Kiva through SMT created a tremendous impact in the lives of these teachers. Because of the successes of the first loan to the teachers of WCSL Mabanta, WCSL Makama from the next village has decided to join their colleagues in seeking a loan from SMT.\r\n<p>\r\nWCSL Mabanta was established in 1970 to give formal training to the children of Mabanta village and its environs. Over the years, this school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and many other professionals in different walks of life. Presently, the school has 368 pupils with a staff of 10 teachers.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home-building projects.  \r\n<p>\r\nFifty-three year old Solomon S. K. (right) is the headmaster at the school.  He was born in a village called Rogbin. He is married with three children \u2013 two of whom are in Junior Secondary Schools I (JSS I) and the eldest is in a Teachers Training College pursuing a Higher Teachers\u2019 Certificate. Solomon will use his loan to buy house-building materials like corrugated iron zinc, boards, stick and nails. Solomon\u2019s greatest desire is to see the completion of the house he is constructing. Being able to complete building his house will relieve him of the many problems tenants suffer at the hands of landlords, he told me.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4300,"image":{"id":286222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy house-building materials like corrugated iron zinc, boards, stick and nails","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-13T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu A.

They have three children who live with them in their home.  After they decided to get back together and for the wellbeing of their children, she and her spouse decided to sow a number of fields, leased for the most part, in addition to a banana plantation they own.  On the other lands, they sowed pineapple where the agreement with the landholders is that the profits will be equally shared, which allows them to pay for the family's basic needs.  They work together from 8:00 A.M. and during the entire day in the fields.

Aside from pigs, she also grows vegetables in her backyard to augment their income.\r\n\r\nShe is asking a loan of Php 5,000 from CEVI. She will use the loan to buy piglets and feed for the pigs. Her loan will definitely help her expand her business. The more pigs she raises, all the more profit she gets.\r\n\r\nCEVI is a non-profit organization and a partner of the WorldVision Philippines that helps people start and have their own business.

In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 9,000,000 VND (525 USD) to buy cloth to make clothes which she can sell to people in her community.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by

When she is not taking care of her animals, Mrs. H\u1ea3i takes advantage of any spare time to earn some extra money working part time.  With a total monthly income of 5,000,000 VND (288 USD), the financial situation of her family is improving and becoming more secure.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":286531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchasing

Ahmadjon is 43 years old. He is married with 6 children. Ahmadjon manufactures carved wooden doors, window frames, and partitions in the traditional oriental style on order. He has been in this business for 14 years already. Over these years Ahmadjon became a real expert in his business and has a lot of customers. <P>\r\n\r\nSince Ahmadjon has a lot of customerss and demand, the business is very successful and brings in stable and significant income, allowing Ahmadjon to improve the living conditions of his family. Now Ahmadjon has a big order for manufacturing window frames and doors. Thus today he requests 550 US Dollars to purchase input materials and wood products for his manufacturing. <P>\r\n\r\nThe previous loan was managed by Ahmadjon without violations, and he promises to repay the current one on time as well. He is counting on your help and he expresses his gratitude to everyone for supporting him.  <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband, 33 years old, has gone to work overseas.  She works at home as a seamstress and raises animals.  Because she lacked enough money to buy animals or cloth, in 2006 Mrs. \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng joined the TYM Fund. Now, after two years participating in the Fund and using her loans effectively, the financial situation of her family is steadily becoming more secure, with a monthly income of 5,000,000 VND (297 USD).  With the 8,000,000 VND (475 USD) that she has decided to request in the next round of lending, she plans to buy a water buffalo and repair the enclosure she uses to raise animals.  <br

from Kigali, Rwanda!

She has two employees who help her run the shop.  \r\n\r\nAntoinette is requesting a loan of 500,000 Rwandan Francs to be paid back over a period of eight months.  She will use the loan to buy a refrigerator for her shop so that she can sell cold drinks.  \r\n\r\nAntoinette is 58 years old, widowed, and has three children.  In addition, she cares for four dependants.  She hopes that this loan will help her increase her monthly profit so it will be easier for her to pay school fees for her children.

Khorn Y. is a villager in Trapaing Knol village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Chor Phal, is a construction worker. Although they try to work hard, they still earn little income to support their household.

D. is 41 years old, married, and has two sons. She runs a sewing business out of a 10 square meter rental room. In 2007, she started her business by buying a sewing machine and fabric that cost MNT 40,000 ($1.00 USD=1,600.00 MNT). Her business has been successful ever since and allowed her to purchase three more sewing machines and hire two tailors. Her working capital has grown from 40,000 MNT to 1.5 million MNT. Her daily income now is around 1.0 million MNT. She gets many orders due to the lack of competing businesses in her area. With her profits, her husband built a 40 sq. meter house on the plot of land that they own. Before her business flourished, she lived in a \"ger\" (traditional, nomadic form of tent housing) in the local ger district.

need to improve his income and provide education for his 4 dear children are the reasons Makhsud is courteously requesting this loan. He is a very responsible and hard-working father who for many years has been dedicated to the business of buying and selling shoes. <P>\r\n\r\nMakhsud has so far accessed loans from IMON International five times and has seen his business expand. With the income, he said he was able to educate his children as that is the most important for Maksud. Today he is requesting a loan of 850 USD to expand the business so that he can generate more income in order to be able to arrange the wedding of his son. Maksud is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition to potential lenders. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

A. Aubierge traces her roots to the historic city of ABOMEY, in Zou County.  Aubierge is a photographer and video-reporter by training.  Because she lacks the financial means for buying cameras, so as to practice her profession, she got started in commerce.\r\n<p>\r\nAubierge is married to Mr. DJIHOKIN Basile, a motorbike mechanic by training.  She is the mother of two girls and a boy who are all in school.  Her family lives in a rental in Hlacomey, an outlying district of the city of COTONOU, where her business of 15 years has been in selling various goods (soaps; rice in sacks of 5-, 10-, and 20-kg; evaporated milk, canned tomatoes; peanut oil; detergents; toilet paper; boxes of sugar; pasta such as spaghetti, school supplies, etc.) \r\n<p>\r\nFour years ago now, she opened a telephone center in Tokpa, the international marketplace of BENIN, where she sells recharge phone cards of all the telephone networks in B\u00e9nin.  She has four phones allowing market-goers to make and receive phone calls.  Aubierge herself is the one who takes care of the telecenter at the Tokpa marketplace. \r\n<p>\r\nBack at the house, she has the help of a sister of hers in selling various goods.  Aubierge has five people to support, which means she spends 3,000 francs CFA on average for food per day for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions creating another display of goods next to her telecenter at the Tokpa marketplace.

P. belongs to the \"Las Alemendras\" Communal Bank in the district of Caler\u00eda. She is 33 years old, has three children, and her husband works as a stevedore.\r\n\r\nShe entered the dairy business, and with her first loan of 300 soles, she was able to buy milk and produce yogurt, cheese, manjar, etc. This business, however, required a lot of time and care, so she began another business buying and selling clothing, shoes, and cleaning and beauty products. This loan of 1,500 soles would do well to help expand her business. She will use it to buy shoes, slippers, shirts, skirts, tights for school uniforms and also a supply of cleaning and beauty supplies. Manuela Ramos has helped her develop a great deal--she has her own business, isn't dependent on her husband, is in charge of her own income and contributes to her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":286758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase shoes, slippers, shirts, skirts, tights, cleaning and beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":305.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111792,"comment":null},{"amount":94.99,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":305.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006985,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":305.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590636,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":305.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984882,"comment":null},{"amount":95.01,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":305.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T00:43:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94578,"name":"Alimatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alimatu S. is 47 years old.

est\u00e1 separada hace varios a\u00f1os. Una de las actividades que realiza con m\u00e1s frecuencia es la venta de tamales, los cuales son consumidos a la hora del desayuno, pues son unos deliciosos aperitivos a base de ma\u00edz con relleno de carne muy solicitados por las madres de familia. Do\u00f1a Juana hace 12 a\u00f1os se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de estos productos, pues tiene el don de la cocina y sus  tamales son lo mejor que sabe preparar, es por ello que son muy solicitados en los mercados y las ferias. Adem\u00e1s cuando ha habido oportunidad, los ha preparado para grandes eventos o ferias de gastronom\u00eda. Juana desea seguir preparando estos deliciosos tamales, pero su mayor limitaci\u00f3n es que no tiene una movilidad para trasladar sus productos a los diversos lugares donde tiene que entregar sus pedidos, es por ello que su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es adquirir un auto para movilizarse, minimizando de esta manera sus gastos de producci\u00f3n. Este es su d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y desea seguir perteneciendo a este grupo de trabajo, pues junto a sus amigas aprendieron administrar su dinero, ya que tienen autonom\u00eda para organizarse y desarrollar habilidades dentro de su banco comunal. Juana  tiene pensado invertir 3500, por lo pronto, en la compra de un molino para agilizar la preparaci\u00f3n de sus tamales, pues el que tiene es muy antiguo y necesita algunos repuestos.","en":"Juana is very tenacious with the things she does, as she supports three small children and is also responsible for their education, and can no longer count on the support of her partner, with whom she separated many years ago. One of the activities Juana does frequently is to sell tamales, which are eaten at lunch time. They are delicious snacks made with corn and filled with meat and are very sought-after by other mothers. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana has been preparing these products for 12 years. She has a gift for cooking, and her tamales are the best she knows to make. It is because of this that they are so sought-after in the markets and fairs. She also has made them for large events and food festivals. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana would like to continue to prepare these delicious tamales, but her biggest limitation is that she is unable to transport her products to fill her orders. Due to this, her greatest dream is to acquire a vehicle to move her products, minimizing the costs of production. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP (a Kiva Partner), and she wishes to continue her membership with this group, as together with her friends, she was able to learn to administer her money, and she had the autonomy to organize and develop her skills with her community bank. Juana hopes to invest 3500 as soon as possible, to buy a new mill to speed the production of her tamales, as the one she has is very old and needs repair. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":286887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a new mill for corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":384.4},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":386.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":408.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":423.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":445.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":463.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":483.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":504.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.39},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.02},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":384.4,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":388.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117233,"comment":null},{"amount":121.39,"local_amount":386.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":390.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012148,"comment":null},{"amount":128.35,"local_amount":408.4,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":412.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595733,"comment":null},{"amount":133.02,"local_amount":423.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":427.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989996,"comment":null},{"amount":140.12,"local_amount":445.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":450.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211129,"comment":null},{"amount":201.06,"local_amount":639.75,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":646.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640636,"comment":null},{"amount":255.25,"local_amount":812.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":820.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T04:24:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94634,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 40 a\u00f1os, dedica su vida al cuidado de su esposo y sus dos hijos integrantes de su  familia que la llena de alegr\u00eda.

Her ability to take advantage of opportunities led her to create her own business in the corner of her home, as she realized that with the amount of people in her area, it was the perfect place for her business. For the last 10 years, she has sold breakfast foods each morning from 6 a.m. until mid-day. But her activities don't end then, because upon her return to her home she prepares snacks that she also sells in her area. <p>\r\n\r\nThis activity is very tiring, above all during her early mornings, as the cold or the heat will tire her. But upon seeing her clients and knowing that at the end of the day she will have sufficient earnings to fulfill the needs of her loved ones, she is motivated to put forth much effort and do it with a big smile. For the future, Mar\u00eda would like to finish construction on her home to install a restaurant and leave behind all those early mornings in the street. <p>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been with MFP (a Kiva Partner) for 3 years.

She now has three children who are her greatest treasure. She and her husband managed to obtain a house in which they could offer their young ones safety and stability. Her thirst for progress drove her to partake in several business activities throughout her life, finally settling on cosmetology 2 years ago. This was one of the businesses that brought in the most profits for her because she only invested in purchasing products, and her skills and creativity as a hairstylist were enough to make her a competent person. After a few months passed and she realized that her services were in demand, she took the initiative to set up a beauty salon, but she did not have enough funds to do so. Nevertheless, her husband materialized her dream by converting the first floor of their home into the beauty salon that she needed. Since then, things have improved because Martha now gladly offers her services all day long. However, she now needs to increase her number of cutting-edge equipment in order to work more efficiently. This is her very first loan with MFP, and she received a warm welcome from the group. Martha hopes to continue being a part of this team. The money that Martha is requesting will be invested in purchasing supplies such as dyes, hair products, and other things that she needs to better serve her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":286896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase beauty supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T06:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.35},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.97},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":90.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117235,"comment":null},{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":93.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012151,"comment":null},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":97.07,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":104.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595736,"comment":null},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":108.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989999,"comment":null},{"amount":35.67,"local_amount":106.97,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":114.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211132,"comment":null},{"amount":36.83,"local_amount":110.53,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640639,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T08:04:53Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94640,"name":"Adela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adela  es socia del Banco Comunal Orcasitas, Adela vive en la comunidad de Orcasitas que se ubica a 30 minutos de la ciudad de Ayacucho.\nAdela es casada, tiene 36 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Adela junto a su esposo se dedican a la fabricaci\u00f3n de ladrillos artesanales, para lo cual cuenta con el apoyo de peones, sus ventas lo realiza en la misma comunidad.\nAdela necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 900 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de ladrillos crudos y el pago de peones.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Adela son construir su casa de material noble y que sus hijos culminen sus estudios.\n","en":"Adela is a member of the Orcasitas Microfinance Institute.
