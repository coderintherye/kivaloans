Aside from Candida\u2019s farming business financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also has a retailing business which is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially for her grandchildren\u2019s education until college. With that, Candida is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase fertilizers, rice seeds \u201cpalay\u201d, and support the maintenance of her retail business. This would provide for her and make their business grow, and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambition in life.\r\n\r\nCandida has been an ASHI member since 2002.

Prior to ASHI, Rosemarie had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams. Positive growth from her business has helped Rosemarie fund the education of her children. Since joining ASHI, Rosemarie has experienced positive changes in her life. She hopes her fishing business will continue to flourish so she can provide long-term financial stability for her family.\r\n\r\nHer fishing business also contributes income for them and that\u2019s why, even if sometimes selling fish is hard to do, she never gets tired of doing it. Therefore, she is now requesting another loan for the much larger amount of 45,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) to purchase an additional fishnet and support the maintenance of their pump boat. This will allow her to grow their business further so that their children can fulfill their dreams of experiencing a life that\u2019s full of happiness. She is continuing to pray and wishes lenders all the best and good luck. She hopes they will continue to support poor families like them, who want to improve their standard of living. Her long-term goals are to help support her children's education, invest and build a better house for the family, and to have a full-fledged fishing

Her husband is a fisherman \u2013 that\u2019s why one source of their income is from fishing. Her husband works hard in the day catching fish in the lake, but he only brings home a small amount of money because the owner of the fishing equipment gets a larger amount \u2013 they only give him a percent.\r\n\r\nSo Isabelita decided to apply for a loan from Kiva's field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), to buy the things needed in fishing so that the revenue will be only for them. She will use the loan to buy fishing cages (fish traps), fishing nets, and other things needed in the fishing business. She will help her husband sell the fish he catches in the lake. \r\n\r\nIsabelita decided to put up this business in order to increase their daily income and meet their needs, like everyday expenses and the education of their two children. With more fish to catch and sell, Isabelita believes that sales will increase leading to higher revenue. As a dedicated member of ASHI, she ensures strong performance with regular attendance at group meetings and steady repayments. Isabelita is thankful for access to capital and loans to support her entrepreneurial dreams. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that her business will continue to flourish to improve the family\u2019s quality of life and fund her children\u2019s education until they finish

Her family lives in a small house, in the outer <i>ger<\/i> (nomadic housing tents) districts of the city. Her husband works as a mobile-phone repairman in Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia, while her oldest son attends primary school.\r\n\r\nShe supports her family by operating a retail jewelry stall in Narantuul. When she first began her business in 2006, it was hard to find rental space at the market. She rented a stall at Narantuul from a person who already had a rental contract with Narantuul. Renting from a middleman at Narantuul exposed her to a risk of the contract being canceled at any time. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 2008, Oyun-Erdene had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul. Last year, her family bought a small house with 8.5 million Mongolian tugriks (MNT) from their business earnings.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband, Jonie R., who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 11 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nGenie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Genie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future family expenses. \r\n\r\nGenie is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Profits she will be getting would augment her husband\u2019s income as a fisherman, and as soon as her business grows, she will be able to support her children\u2019s education until they finish college. By then, her role of being mother would be rewarded. \r\n\r\nHer relationship with ASHI and the loans she taken since she became a member helped her in running a business. Because of this, Paulina has solid records in repayment, attendance, and business (credit rating), thus making her qualified for a higher amount of loan. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a new loan to finance the maintenance of her fishing business. This loan will be utilized to purchase additional fish cages (fish traps) and fishing net to catch more fish to sell in her neighborhood and the nearby village.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to expand her fishing business into a fish-farm venture, to give her children brighter hopes, and to provide for other needs in order to enjoy the gifts of a life that\u2019s full of blessing from almighty God and support from the good hearts of our Kiva supporters.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":703764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC.

She then started operating her business as a tailor and received orders for men's and women's clothes.

Her previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and for family needs.\r\n\r\nRosalina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

T. is a single parent who works hard in order to provide the best for her son. She is 61 years old and is from Maybato North, San Jose, Antique, Philippines. She is living with her son Samson, who is 31 years old and a fisherman. Being a single mom, sometimes she encounters difficulty in coping with their family needs and especially if there are some unexpected problems. Despite some challenges, she never gives up and instead she considers the problems as an inspiration.\r\n\r\nShe has been an active member of the branch from 1998 to the present. Being a member, she maintained her good performance because she wanted to prove that she is trustworthy. Because of her good performance, she has been able to access some incentive loans of ASHI like the House Repair Loan and the Market Day Loan.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she had already fully paid her previous loan and she is now borrowing PHP 35,000. This amount will be used to purchase a unit of a pump boat (Fishing Boat) which they will use for fishing. If this amount is granted, it will be a great help for them to sustain their basic needs.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream in life is to have a comfortable house and to have a small variety store in their community so that they will have another source of income with which she will have a little savings for their future needs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":464,"image":{"id":703781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Fishing

C. is a married woman who lives in Poblacion, Poblacion, Compostela, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and general store businesses. Her husband Carmelito C., who is 60 years old, works as a welder and carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 18 to 32 years old. \r\n\r\nLudivina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ludivina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase fish so that she can continue to save up for future repairs for the house and for her children's school fees. \r\n\r\nLudivina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

By working hard in her food vending and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 11,000 PHP. \r\n\r\nSamelita is now borrowing 21,000 PHP to fund her business operations. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nSamelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her child. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":703778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  motorcycle transport and hog-fattening and duck-raising businesses. Her husband, Rusel E., who is 47 years old, works as a motorcycle transport operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n\r\nThey have six children who are between 12 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nMarjorie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marjorie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to pay for a motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for the future education of the children. Marjorie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. is a married woman who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband, Elesio F., who is 49 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business.  \r\n\r\nThey have two children who are 11 and 26 years old. \r\n\r\nBetty joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Betty has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her family's future and her children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nBetty is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her ready-to-wear clothes and transport businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500. \r\n\r\nEmeliana is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase a motorcycle. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nEmeliana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 30-year-old widow who supports her family by operating 2 businesses: a general store and a carinderia (a local eatery). She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. Connie has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Connie is borrowing PHP 26,000 in order to fund her business operations. This will be her 9th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Connie hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Delia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 3rd  loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations in order to save up for her children's education. Delia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Flordeliza has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flordeliza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flordeliza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Flordeliza is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Flordeliza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":703825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Zosima is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Zosima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Gina is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gina from ASKI.

is a 62-year-old married man who supports his family by operating a general store. He lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. He has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved his living conditions with the help of his loans from NWTF and through his own efforts. By working hard in his business, he is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Efren is borrowing PHP 15,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be his 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. His previous loan of PHP 14,000, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey toward economic freedom. Efren hopes to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a sugarcane plantation, and a rice field. \r\n\r\nHer husband Ramelo, who is 40 years old, works as a jeepney driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 3 to 15 years old; two of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nSusan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,500 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stock for the store and fertilizer for the rice and sugarcane. She wants to continue to save up for future education costs and family needs. \r\n\r\nSusan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 60-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a general store. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Loreta is borrowing PHP 13,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Loreta hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Nema has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Nema is borrowing PHP 18,000 in order to fund business operations. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.

is a 49-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 businesses: ready-to-wear clothes and pants and rice retailing.  She lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Josephine has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Josephine is borrowing PHP 26,000 in order to purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Josephine hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is married and lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running three small businesses: aquaculture, tailoring and raising livestock. Her husband, Hernanie E., who is 60 years old, works as a laborer. They have four children who range in age from 26 to 34. Virginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because wanted a better life for her family. With the help of her 14 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been achieving this goal. Her most recent loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 and meant improvements to her family's life. She is applying for a new loan, her 15th, for PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to expand her aquaculture business and thereby help pay for her children's education and for home repairs. Virginia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is married and lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fishing and a livestock business. Her husband, William Z., is 36 years old and works as a backhoe operator. They have four children who range in age from 8 to 10. Florina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of four previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has succeeded in slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her last loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, and brought an improved life to her family. Now, for her fifth loan, she would like to borrow PHP 12,000 to buy new fishing equipment. This will allow her to increase her income further and continue to save for her children's education.

is separated form her spouse and lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental, where she earns a living by buying and selling rice. She has a child who is 26 years old.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted a better life for family. With the help of 17 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped increase her monthly profits to PHP 10,000, and that meant a higher living standard for her family. She is applying for her 18th loan, for PHP 19,500, to buy more rice to sell because this will allow her to save more money and create a prosperous future for herself and her daughter. Emma is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path to the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through its poverty-alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is 34-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari (variety) store. She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. Reziel has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Reziel is borrowing PHP 12,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Reziel hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three businesses: buying and selling sugarcane crops, tricycle transport and farming. Her husband, Wilson E. Sr., 51 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have three children between the ages of 23 and 27, all of whom currently attend school.\r\n\r\n<p>Zeny joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Zeny has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to buy and sell sugarcane crops. Her goal is to save up for her children's education and for the improvement of her businesses. Zeny is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 38-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari store and a fishing business. She lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1990 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Sisa is borrowing PHP 19,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Sisa hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The rest will be invested in his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":703946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying hardware items ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siaka ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918242,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361202,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226484,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301324,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580905,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750728,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120064,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881956,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699091,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50657.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655380,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-06T22:54:08Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269750,"name":"Marima Korio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marima Korio B. is 32 years old, married to Kimererio Marima, and a father of four school-aged children.

 S. is a married woman who lives in Ipilan, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  general store and food production sales businesses. Her husband Hamirol, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are 15 to 36 years old.\r\n\r\n Merlinda  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,900, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the future, her children's education and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nMerlinda  S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in Sandoval, Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a business venture: buying and selling rice grain.  Her husband Erico C., who is 42 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 1 to 12 years old. \r\n\r\nEmelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional capital for the rice field so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of her business and more savings. Emelda C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   food production, buying and selling medicines, and buying and selling rice. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Orly G., who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have one child who is 11 years old. \r\n\r\nMarlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,300 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use to buy spices and ingredients for the food she makes.

Despite many difficulties, he began studying to become a civil engineer, but was not able to complete his studies. \r\n\r\nOne of his aunts is a dentist and saw a good attitude and a lot of promise in Jose I. and this is why she suggested that he take up her profession.

This person got him started selling dental supplies and equipment, which helped him to learn about this field.\r\n\r\nHe has been working in this business for roughly three years now. He feels that he has learned a lot and above all, he has gotten to know his customers and their needs.

He is requesting this loan in order to purchase several used pieces of equipment which he plans to repair in order to resell them.

Together, they work every day to advance themselves. Beginning when he was very young, he learned everything about making clothing, since he watched how his parents carried out this work in the workshop in their house. It is in this way that at the age of 12 he began to help them, and now he works alongside his father creating garments to wear, according to the season.

He is married to Fortunita, who is 60 years old. They have their own house on Santa Rosa Avenue in the district of San Francisco. Due to circumstances beyond their control, they are not able to have children. Juan is focused on his responsibilities as a husband. At an early age, his parents taught him sales and he grew up with this gift. Today he buys produce like local cocoa, coffee and fruit, which he has done independently for 30 years. Once he has bought cocoa and coffee, they are stored until he obtains a good quantity and later he transfers them to gathering companies and gets a good percentage for each kilo he sells. This activity is profitable because he is able to buy many goods. Now he has his own vehicle, which makes it easy to transport the produce to the storage center. The months of January, February and March are the season of rain and landslides on the highways, which blocks the passage of the produce and hurts his business. His new plan for the well being of his business is to buy another car, as the one he has is very old and not in perfect condition, thus he needs a new one to continue his work. This is his third loan from MFP, and he has been very punctual in his previous loans. He knows that he must make his payments punctually in order to get more loans in the future. With 1,000 soles, he will renovate the front of his house so he can rent rooms, which he considers very profitable.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":704263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"Restore front of house and be able to rent rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":76.18},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":81.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.4},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":96.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":99.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.19,"local_amount":67.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887282,"comment":null},{"amount":27.16,"local_amount":72.41,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327658,"comment":null},{"amount":27.6,"local_amount":73.6,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":76.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196193,"comment":null},{"amount":28.56,"local_amount":76.18,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":79.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269869,"comment":null},{"amount":29.52,"local_amount":78.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":81.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549886,"comment":null},{"amount":30.32,"local_amount":80.86,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718543,"comment":null},{"amount":31.73,"local_amount":84.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350011,"comment":null},{"amount":32.73,"local_amount":87.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":90.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850568,"comment":null},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":90.39,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":94.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665800,"comment":null},{"amount":108.29,"local_amount":288.8,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":300.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-01T01:36:22Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":269883,"name":"Rafael Arles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Rafael Arles M.

O. is from the village of Poblacion, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur.

She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $445 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Frevisminda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and dressmaking. Her 52-year-old husband, Feliciano, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have five children who are between 11 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nTessie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tessie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy feeds, medicines and vaccines for the pigs. She wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nTessie is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilou is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marilou makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling dried fish in the market. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilou joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nMarilou is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Marilou from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  firewood, used clothing and pig fattening. Her 58-year-old husband, Julio, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 23 and 32 years old. \r\n\r\nFelicisima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felicisima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,900, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy new equipment for farming so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. \r\n\r\nFelicisima is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and feeds and fish vending. Her 35-year-old husband, Alberto I. III, works as a casual employee to earn his living. They have four children who are between 4 and 12 years old.  \r\n\r\nRhoda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rhoda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3200, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for future house improvements and family needs. \r\n\r\nRhoda is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Milo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Milo is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Milo from ASKI.

Tuao North, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 50 years old. Elsa is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElsa is married and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Elsa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elsa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Elsa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
