She learned from a girlfriend who invited her to go out selling and she started out this way with just a little merchandise but gradually expanded it.\r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise in the nation\u2019s capital and it takes her about two hours to get there; she transports herself in her own vehicle.  Sometimes she buys in a nearer city that\u2019s only an hour away from her community.  When she has to go far to get it, Mar\u00eda rises at 4am to do so to then sell it but when she goes to get it closer she gets up at 5am.  She travels distances of more or less an hour or an hour and a half in her own vehicle and she seeks out the market days in each city or if they have a holiday or special activity so she goes out every day.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy larger amounts of clothes for women, men and children, underwear and footwear because by buying the bundles it\u2019s less expensive and she can start preparing for the Christmas season.  She will buy more for a lower price which will allow for higher profits and more business growth at the same time.  What Mar\u00eda wants is to expand her coverage and sell other types of products, like dairy products, besides clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":316.04,"image":{"id":905067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothes, underwear and footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-11-02T07:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":71.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":88.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":92.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.19},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.03,"local_amount":77.03,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":77.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562749,"comment":null},{"amount":77.51,"local_amount":77.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":77.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773881,"comment":null},{"amount":81.63,"local_amount":81.63,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":81.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182461,"comment":null},{"amount":79.87,"local_amount":79.87,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":79.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317459,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T18:36:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":351710,"name":"Nicanor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201dKANTUS\u201d; El banco comunal se encuentra ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\nEl socio es el Sr. Nicanor;  El socio  tiene 68 a\u00f1os de edad, El socio  es casado, El socio  tiene 2 hijos; el socio trabaja dentro del banco comunal 4 a\u00f1os y el  es carpintero, el socio trabaja para diferentes obras y lo contratan por a\u00f1os, el tambi\u00e9n pudo invertir sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos en la compra de una cepilladora, un circular, y una compresora, entonces ahora cuando tiene tiempo y generalmente se da espacio, el socio realiza diversos trabajos de manera independiente de carpinter\u00eda como muebles, estantes, reparaciones y otros, el socio en esta ocasi\u00f3n requiere el cr\u00e9dito para invertir en su taller de carpinter\u00eda comprando herramientas varias para mejorar las que ya tienen a\u00f1os, el socio comprara serrucho, taladro, martillo, clavos entre otros, el socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en la compra de herramientas para su trabajo, como serrucho, clavos, martillo, taladros entre otros.\nEl socio agradece el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete  a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas de acuerdo al cronograma de pagos.\n","en":"Sr. Nicanor is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cKantus\u201d which is located in the District of Huanchac in Cusco Province, Department of Cusco.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is 68 years old, married, and has two children.

She has four children, of which only one lives with her along with two grandchildren in a home she owns in the native community of Pucharini. Diana says her business consists of buying and selling clothing. She acquires her merchandise at wholesale from the \"Gamarra\" center in the city of Lima. Once purchased, she travels through the native communities of Pichanaki and sell the items, since she has customers there who make orders in advance, so she has the security of always having faithful buyers. At the same time, although at a smaller scale, she works in the fields harvesting bananas, avocado, coffee and citrus fruits. She assures that her clothing sales have always been lucrative, attracting regular customers. \"On good days my investment of 1,000 soles triples,\" she says excitedly. As far as problems she has had to overcome, Diana mentions the lack of her own capital as principal, but with time and thanks to her tireless work, this enterprising woman plans to open up a convenience store so she won't have to travel as much. With your support, Diana will obtain her fourth loan through Kiva partner MFP, an organization she is grateful to, and promises to work hard to make her payments. At the same time she feels content working with her community bank because some of the members also make a living in the same trade.

For 40 years, he has been married to Julia, his inseparable partner who is 55 years old, and they\u2019ve raised seven children who have now left home. Together they care for their seven year old grandson in their humble but tidy home in their native community of Pucharini. \r\n\r\nAbram has worked as a farmer since he was a boy and in his old age he continues to farm avocados, bananas, plantains, oranges, and other types of citrus. He has had to hire other people to help him plant, cultivate, and harvest these crops. At the same time, Abram offers his services as a natural healer, a job which nature and the years have taught him. \u201cI am well-known. Sometimes people from La Merced, Satipo, and other places come to have a cleansing with medicinal plants. I earn 20 soles per person, and there are days when groups of 15 or 20 come,\u201d says Abram.  Also, he adds that he gets a good revenue, 15 to 20 soles, from each case of 200 avocados. \r\n\r\nFor her part, Julia has a small store in their home, since due to her age she no longer works in the fields. Together they teach their grandson that their daughter, for personal reasons during childbirth, has left. She thinks that after a few years she will consolidate her store, since her energy won\u2019t be the same in the future.  For that reason they are eager to see their grandson grow up with them. \r\n\r\nWith her help, Abram will be able to get his fourth loan from MFP, and he is committed to being punctual with his payments. \u201cAs with the previous loans, I will pay everything, because it\u2019s a great help to my family, working with MFP and my communal bank,\u201d he says. With the money that he gets, Abram and Julia will buy bags of rice, sugar, cases of milk, cans of oil, and soda and beer to sell.

She gives her thanks to the Fundacion for helping people who have the desire to start their own business and those who want to expand them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":892280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy coloured threads, blankets and ribbons to make traditional embroidered dresses, blouses and housecoats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-05T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastina  Hermila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573274,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784986,"comment":null},{"amount":112.31,"local_amount":1497.44,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193549,"comment":null},{"amount":75.19,"local_amount":1002.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1016.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329920,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-05T22:27:58Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":351799,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yolanda, tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, esta acompa\u00f1ada con cuatro hijos.\n\nYolanda es una mujer muy emprendedora, que se dedica a la compra y venta de ropa para damas, caballeros, como: faldas, camisas, pantalones y ropa interior, al por menor desde hace 2 a\u00f1os.

At 53 years old, he is still single but he takes care of his 80 year old mother, and his little brother, to whom he is more like a father. The three live happily under their own humble roof. Ever since he was very young, Gabino has lived surrounded by neighbours and friends who dedicate themselves to agriculture, so he grew up accustomed to the labours of the field and he still grows vegetables and herbs. When he was 20 years old, Gabino had to take the reins as head of the family, and look after his little brothers, when his father died. This was how he came to dedicate his life to farming, and while the crops were growing Gabino would also work as a labourer in other people's farms and as a bricklayer, so that he could ensure his little brother's education could continue. \r\n\r\nHe says that the pea harvest is his most profitable crop, because if he doesn't sell them fresh he can still sell them dried as seeds, at a price of nearly 500 Soles a bag. The potato harvest, even although it only comes round every 6 months, represents a considerable income for the family. In future, he would like to see his brothers fulfil their potential,and for his mother to stay in good hands, because her age no longer permits her to live with the same vigour. Gabino is very reliable. This is his 13th loan with MFP, and he has shown himself to be a good worker and part of his communal bank, from which he recieves good support. With the money, Gabino will be able to buy fertilizers to enrich the soil for the potatoes he plans to harvest in May. He will also pay hired labourers for their help in sowing, cultivating and harvesting the crop. He expects to invest around 2500 Soles in the process.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":905200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer and to hire labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T07:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T23:39:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":351812,"name":"Maday","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maday  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSanta Rosa de Lima\u201d, ubicado en el distrito Juli, provincia de Chucuito y departamento de Puno, tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y tiene un hijo.

She is a member of the communal bank Villa Rica which is comprised of seven members from the Carabayllo district in the Villa Rica area.\r\n\r\nShe sells \"chocotejas\" (chocolate covered pecans or nuts and caramel) for a living and started her business two years ago.  At an institution in Lima that supports and trains low-income communities she learned how to make the chocolates.  Being the enterprising and innovative person she is, in an effort to increase sales she began to introduce variations of the chocolate and now has many chocoteja orders for special occasions and events.\r\n\r\nThrough her work she has been able to give her children an education and buy essential items for the household.  One of her goals is to have her own business or a small chocolate company.

She needs your help to make her projects a reality.  She\u2019s been working with the communal bank for some time and she mentions that she feels good and comfortable with her fellow members.  The money from the loan will be used to buy pea seeds and three sacks of manure which adds up to 1500 soles per parcel and Olinda plans to plant on two parcels.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":905286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pea seeds and three sacks of manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T18:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-03T18:39:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":351862,"name":"Serzhik","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043a  \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f 1983\u0433. \u0432  \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u041d.\u0410\u043d\u0434(N.Hand) \u0421\u044e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435.\u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e-\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 . \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438  \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 -

In addition, Juan has animals: 4 cows, 4 bulls, sheep, guinea pigs and pigs.  He gets milk from the cows, he couples the bulls with a yoke (he attaches the bulls by the head to a special tool called a 'yoke' so that they can plow the soil), and he raises the sheep and then sells their meat or sells them alive to be slaughtered in other towns.  In all this work, he has had problems.  For example, in previous years his cattle became sick and he had to kill them immediately.  For this reason, he constantly calls veterinarians to his community to give them check-ups.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juan's 9th loan from MFP and he hopes to receive your help.

The couple have five children but only care for three of them.  They all live in the warmth of their own home which is located in the small village of Cochayoc, in Acobamba district.  Laberiano and Mar\u00eda started working their land when they first got together.  Each of them learned the business from their family.

On land which he owns, Laberiano grows peas, potatoes, spinach, turnips, <i>ollucos<\/i> (a native tuber), carrots and other crops.  The crop which makes him the most income is the peas because they flower and grow in their pods quickly.  They are also in high demand in the city of Tarma. \r\n\r\nIn parallel with this work, Laberiano also raises cattle.  In his stables he has 5 cows, 2 bulls and 5 sheep which he fattens and then sells in the city.  \"We buy young bulls, graze them and fatten them over a period of 6 months to 1 year, depending on the size, and then we sell them\", he says.  This tenacious father tells us that the difficult times he has experienced were as a result of a lack of capital, the bad distribution of fertilizers on his land and a lack of insecticides.  For this reason, he has learned to cope with these factors in his planting and harvesting.  \"I hope to buy a used car in the future so that I can save money on paying to transport my produce\", he says.  This is one of his goals for the next couple of years.\r\n\r\nThis will be Laberiano's 9th loan from MFP and he needs your help.  For his part, he pledges to make his repayments on time.

The couple have seven children.  They live together in their own home which is located in the community of Teresa, Pichari.  Juan always planned to have a business which would make him profits and so decided to work in agriculture.  He knows the techniques and the work which must be done in order to bring his crops to maturity.  He grows and harvests cacao, a product which is in high demand in both the national and international market and is therefore very profitable.  However, in order to make profits, he must wait months and so, for this reason, he also supports himself by renting out farmland.  He is happy to have chosen this line of work as it makes him good income.  He generally works alone but he sometimes receives the support of his partner and children.  At harvest time, however, he needs more labor in order to pick his fruit.

She sells Nivi and Unimoda-brand clothes through a catalog.  She makes her sales door to door.  She works four days a week, three hours a day, mainly in the mornings, as this is when her children are in school and so she can make her sales much more quickly.  She leaves her products on credit and collects payment every two weeks.  She has been in her business for nearly seven years now and it is doing very well.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 needs this loan to buy pants, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothes in all styles and designs.  This is her seventh loan cycle with her community bank which she likes because of the ease with which she can obtain loans.

They hope that with their efforts they will be able to get their children ahead.  They also hope to give them a better life and an excellent education.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan Claudia managed to increase her customers, and some of them started to buy from her exclusively.

She is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To making a living, B\u00ecnh owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. B\u00ecnh has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately VND 5,000,000 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, B\u00ecnh joined Kiva's partner, SEDA, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. B\u00ecnh has successfully repaid a previous loan of VND 4,256,000 from SEDA. This previous loan was used to renovate the existing shelter for her livestock. B\u00ecnh is now requesting a new loan of VND 6,048,000 which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the sixth loan B\u00ecnh has borrowed from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nB\u00ecnh l\u00e0 43 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Mary Jane as she herself has been an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a rug-making business.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php8, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She mainly offers rugs from those round palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGeraldine dreams to be able to give all of her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

At this point in time, she is starting to educate them in the value of hard work and patience in running a business.\r\n\r\nShe is into a food vending business. She purchases raw meat and vegetables from the market, cooks it into different meals and sells it in her neighborhood and the local community. She has a small stall just a stone\u2019s throw away from her residence. It is located in a crowded area where selling food is not hard at all. She\u2019s also into selling barbeque at night, as well as being a rug maker, and these businesses add up to her daily income of about 800 Philippine Pesos. \r\n\r\nRowena is requesting a loan amounting to Php10,000 that will help as additional capital. She will spend it to buy additional raw products she needs in her business. She will prioritize and purchase raw meat for her barbeque business since there\u2019s a clamor for it in her area. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing all her children finish their studies and have a good life. She wants to secure a good education for them even if she is all alone in raising them up. The weekly fellowship* made her change the negative attitude she had in the past. It gave her time to read the Bible and share her own understanding from it. She learned to be more disciplined because of CCT.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":905690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":" To pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-30T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2873.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571902,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2872.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529470,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3592.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738686,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1436.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-30T22:37:49Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":352046,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is married with 5 siblings.

She is married and has 3 adult -aged children.  To making a living, Loan owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a butcher shop.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from butchering & selling pork in the local community.  Loan has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mrs Loan joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  she  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.840.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 9.184.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nB\u00edch l\u00e0 41 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.
