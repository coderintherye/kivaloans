She found her life very routine and felt overwhelmed. Her mom encouraged her to start her business as a hobby. She remembers that she started with a small capital of less than $200 dollars and that in a short amount of time she realized that more than a hobby, it was a source of income. This made her feel more useful. Later on, she started a small store which helps her pay for her college education.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy merchandise such as rice, sugar, oil, and beans to sell in her grocery store. She also wants to buy cosmetics, clothes, and perfumes to sell in her clothing store.

She is a single mother with two children, ages 12 and 2 respectively.  Leana only has a basic education, having finished high school but not continuing on for a college degree.  She is a merchant who prepares and sells donuts.  Leana learned this trade from her mother, who was in the business of making donuts for 45 years.  Gradually over time, Leana learned everything she needed to know about the business.  Today she runs her own donut venture that is separate from her mother\u2019s business.  She now has a line of products that are sold in the capital of Managua, where she delivers orders once a week.\r\n<p>\r\nLeana is requesting a loan to buy raw materials such as corn, lard, sugar, cheese, and firewood for making donuts.  With this investment, she will be able to acquire supplies more easily for making and completing donut orders from her customers.  Having greater capacity means that she can produce in larger quantities and attract new customers.

is from the village of Gantiadi, South Georgia.

The family has a small dairy farm with three milk cows. They sell milk to local dairy product retailers. Along with the dairy farm they own 0.5 hectare land, where potatoes are grown. Harvested potatoes are sold in Tbilisi (capital city of the country). \r\n\r\nMalkhaz requested credit for financing the harvesting process and harvest transportation costs. He will pay the owner of the tractor which will help him in harvesting potatoes, and the truck driver, who will take the harvested potatoes to Malkhaz\u2019s store-house. Also, part of the credit (approximately 45%) will be used for purchasing wood, which will be used for the oven during the winter months. The oven is the only mean of heating the house in Malkhaz\u2019s village during winter months. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz worked hard during the whole year. The weather conditions were favorable as well and he has good harvest this year. Malkhaz hopes that he\u2019ll be able to sell it for a good price and earn planned profit, part of which will be used for the family's well-being and the other part will be reinvested in potato growing.

The couple have five children: Yadira, Juan Carlos, Yahir, Alexander and Alexis.  Four of their children are in school.  Their eldest [daughter] is in her first year of high school, their next child is in his second year of middle school, another is in his fifth year of elementary school and another is in his second year of pre-school.  Their youngest is just four months old.  Isabel has owned a grocery store for more than four years.\r\n\r\nIsabel says that she decided to invest in this business because she wanted to help her husband with their household expenses as she saw that he was working too much in the fields and wasn't earning enough for them to be really financially stable.  She also wanted to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they could have a very good professional career.

Clelia has recently started selling beauty products from various well-known brands through a catalogue. This versatile woman still has time to take care of her daughter. She puts a lot of effort every weekend into making her rich tamales. She buys the fresh ingredients very early in the morning so that she can have the tamales ready to sell in the streets. She sells them herself in areas close to her home. From Monday to Friday she focuses on her regular duties as a housewife.  She also visits potential clients for her cosmetics, which normally incluD.: lotions, creams, shampoos and other beauty products.

Before One Acre Fund, Jentrix says that she was only able to harvest one bag on 1\/2 acre.  \n\nJentrix has 12 children at home.  With profits from her harvest, she plans on paying for her children's school fees, saving for the future, buying livestock, perhaps investing in a business, and purchasing more land.  \n\nIn total, the Foresty Group expects to plant 11.25 acres of land in 2012, with each farmer planting between 1\/2 and 1 1\/2 acres.

Most farmers in Mifuti group just completed their first season with One Acre Fund.  \n\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important farming inputs to distribute to Dennis and his group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\u00a0\n\nDennis says that he joined One Acre Fund in order to harvest more maize from his land than in previous years, grow enough to feed his family, access good input prices, to have profits to send his children to school, and to learn good quality farming techniques.  \n\nDennis has not yet harvested the maize that he grew this season, but before joining One Acre Fund, he was only able to harvest 4 bags per 1\/2 acre.  He is likely to double that when he harvests this month!\n\nWith profits from his harvest, Dennis plans to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, and invest in livestock.  \n\nIn the coming 2012 season, Mifutu Group will plant 8.5 acres of land, with each farmer planting between 1\/2 and 1 acre each.\n\nIn the picture above, the group is standing in front of a maize field planted with One Acre Fund.  The group Field Officer is second from the left.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":864010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Denis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Everlyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keresenja ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lenah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90300,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T13:25:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333282,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a 45-year-old lady who is married to Mikael, a 52-year-old laborer.

She operates a cosmetic and beauty products stall. Dinora\u2019s family consists of her four children and husband, but just three of her children live with her and their father. She said that her most difficult challenge is taking care of her family by paying attention to their needs, helping her husband to produce income, and also help him to rebuild their house.\r\n\r\nDinora is one of our businesswomen. Before she ran this business, 4 years ago, she saved for a little while untill she had a sufficient amount to start her sales. As soon as she started, she requested a loan in her community group because she needed capital to invest. After 3 years having group loans, she decided to be an individual and start taking bigger loans.

He provides feed and natural pastures so they reach an ideal size and he can sell them in different markets in the area and obtain a very good profit to pay for his family expenses. He also has land planted in lemons and mangos that, once harvested, he sells to earn more income for his household.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 1,500 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa to buy feed to fatten his animals and fertilizer to improve his land so that his products sell for a better price to his customers. With these profits he will be able to repay his loan and improve his quality of life. Jos\u00e9 is a person who is very dedicated to his work. The only thing he wants is to be able to provide some comforts to his family and to help them succeed in life\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.48,"image":{"id":864428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed for his animals and fertilizer to improve his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":109.8},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":110.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":114.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":119.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":119.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":128.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":130.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":139.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":147.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.29,"local_amount":101.7,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232780197,"comment":null},{"amount":40.26,"local_amount":109.8,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":109.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584736,"comment":null},{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":110.45,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":110.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542902,"comment":null},{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":114.1,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":114.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250753398,"comment":null},{"amount":43.67,"local_amount":119.1,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-01T09:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":119.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395430,"comment":null},{"amount":43.92,"local_amount":119.8,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":119.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T04:55:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333486,"name":"Elsa Mabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsa Mabel de 48 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su familia en su casa propia, cuenta con servicio de aua y luz, ubicada en la zona urbana del distrito de Guadalupe que pertenece al departamento de La Libertad.

She is giving them a good education for the future.  Saturnina is a hard-working woman who gets up very early in the morning to make breakfast for all the members of the family.  She then goes to the cropland with her husband to carry out the daily chores.  She grows cocoa, coffee and pineapple which are important crops that provide an income for her family and for her children's education.  She has three hectares of land where she grows plants native to the Peruvian Amazon Jungle climate.  During harvest season or when it is necessary to remove weeds she hires workers so she can keep to schedule and get the work done on time.\r\n\r\nSaturnina is in need of a loan to carry out work such as fighting insect plagues that affect the fruit in its early stages.  She does not have enough funds and needs to buy fertilizer.  She is requesting a loan through MFP which provides loans to people with low income so they can get ahead.  In order to continue with her work she hopes to be able to maintain her strengh and determination to ensure her crops grow successfully.  This will be her fourth loan through MFP.  She is committed to paying it back on time because she would like to continue having access to such loans.  With the 2,500 PEN she has requested she will buy fertilizers to combat the insect plagues that threaten her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":591.78,"image":{"id":864499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T09:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturnina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":169.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":178.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":181.85},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":190.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":195.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.41},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":213.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":217.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":226.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":232.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":243.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":249.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.28},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":156.55,"local_amount":423.12,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":427.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851269,"comment":null},{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":220.74,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":222.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666451,"comment":null},{"amount":170.95,"local_amount":462.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":466.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835686,"comment":null},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":242.39,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":244.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245458,"comment":null},{"amount":92.93,"local_amount":251.16,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":253.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385508,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-12T02:03:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333515,"name":"Gabriela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSAN RAFAEL\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco,  y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

As Sergio is a very peaceful person, he would like to avoid this type of situation in order to avoid setting a bad example to his three children.\r\n\r\nSergio works as a foreman in a cross-border assembly plant and his wife carries out general cleaning work in private houses in order to provide their children with  a better quality of life.  Right now, Sergio doesn't have the money he needs to carry out his project and so he is requesting a loan to buy blocks, sand, cement and rods, and to pay the person who will carry out the work, so that his project is completed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":360.66,"image":{"id":864545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to finish building a wall round their rear yard","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T10:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.53,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":722.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":777.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":836.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":900.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":968.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.99,"local_amount":722.91,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":762.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238581056,"comment":null},{"amount":66.69,"local_amount":777.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":820.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244539357,"comment":null},{"amount":71.74,"local_amount":836.73,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":882.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250750010,"comment":null},{"amount":34.1,"local_amount":397.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":419.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392025,"comment":null},{"amount":126.14,"local_amount":1470.6,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704426,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T16:42:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333527,"name":"Unidas Para Vencer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Banco Comunal Unidas para Vencer esta integrado por diez socias que se dedican a diferentes actividades economicas en la Aldea de San Nicolas en el municipio de Juticalpa.

The bank's coordinator is Kenia Jacqueline and she sells second-hand clothes and sandals.  She is 33 years old, married, and has three sons.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, following the example of one of her neighbors, Kenia decided to start selling second-hand clothes and bought her first bundle of clothes with the financial support of her husband.  Although it wasn't a lot, it was enough to get her started.  Her business doesn't have a name because she makes her sales as an itinerant vendor.  She also sometimes makes sales from her home when her neighbors or friends come to find her.  The biggest difficulty that Kenia faces is the rainy season because it means she can't go out and she loses sales.  She also has problems when she sells merchandise on credit because sometimes her customers take a long time to pay her back.\r\n\r\nKenia needs the loan that she is requesting to buy a bundle of second-hand clothes and also to buy sandals so that she can do something a little different with her business.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business with clothes and sandales in different colors and styles in order to satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nKenia commented very happily that, as a result of the loans she has received from FAMA, she has been able to continue improving her home and has also been able to buy a refrigerator.  This has helped her to save a few cents because, before she bought the refrigerator, some products that needed refrigerating used to go off.\r\n\r\nKenia's goal is to continue supporting her children so that they finish their education.  Her dream is to finish carrying out improvements to her home.  Kenia has been working with FAMA for more than 16 loan cycles and she has made her repayments punctually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

She\u2019s been engaged in commerce there for the last two years when she started her shoe making business making sandals on an antique, simple sewing machine someone gave her.  When this machine broke down and she sent it to be repaired the technician, with no explanation whatsoever, kept it and never returned it to her.  Even so, Flor insisted in finding ways to earn household income and with much effort she bought an industrial sewing machine and used it to accomplish her production.  She makes very good footwear and she\u2019s excited about the growth of her business.  Her goal is to manufacture large purses and to position her products in a commercial locale which will improve her income by concentrating her market and because of the positioning she\u2019ll have.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is attaining sufficient working capital to invest and increase production and this is why she\u2019s calling upon a Kiva loan, first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy shoe making supplies like: leather, soles, glue, lining, straps, accessories, shoe trees and a display case to arrange her products.  While she works toward reaching these goals, she produces a profit margin over sales of no less than 42.4% from which we can predict success in the

This area is characterized by farming and ranching.\r\n\r\nFor several years, Luisa has been selling staple products (milk, oil, sugar, toilet paper, tuna, etc) and beverages. Her business is situated in her home, for her comfort and safety. With the earnings generated from selling her products, she tries to cover all her costs and improve the living standards of her family. She also produces and sells chicha D. jora, a traditional corn liquor, to the customers that visit her business.

Consequently, all of that earlier experience served her well when she started her small grocery store.\r\n\r\nShe obtained this loan to buy a freezer and merchandise, such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, milk, eggs and cleaning products. She wants to keep her business stocked with products in high demand by her customers and to buy a freezer in order to sell beef, chicken, fruit juice, soft drinks, butter, cream and cheese. Her next goal is to expand her grocery store by offering new items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":864781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a freezer and re-stock her merchandise with products such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, milk, eggs and cleaning products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lely Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238663366,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":66.66,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244770063,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":66.66,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":66.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832624,"comment":null},{"amount":600.01,"local_amount":600.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":600.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242551,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T16:55:50Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333562,"name":"Elba Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elba D. 58 a\u00f1os D. edad vive en la ciudad D.

She started the business 14 years ago when she was let go from the important chain of stores where she worked.  She used this money for her entrepreneurial adventure.\r\n\r\nShe started with two display cases on the terrace of a rented house, which is located in front of her house.  In less than one year she managed to buy it.  With the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she expanded her business and paid for her son\u2019s university education.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue being successful with an increase in her working capital.  That is the reason she turns to Kiva and makes use of her Kiva loan.  She wants to buy stationery products, accessories, and novelty items.  She will receive them in the month that requires more investment in the businesses.  This is when sales increase due to the celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day (day of love and friendship).  Children\u2019s and adults\u2019 purchases increase.  Everyone wants to show their affection with gifts for their friends, boyfriends and girlfriends, family members, and neighbors.  Indeed, Nancy\u2019s customers plan to go to her store to buy a nice present.  She needs to have her business stocked with everything they require.\r\n\r\nNancy maintains a contribution margin of 12%, from which we predict her successful investment and potential growth.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":508.87,"image":{"id":864395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stationery products, accessories, and novelty items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":159056},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":171922},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175933},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":180038},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":184239},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":198812}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.91,"local_amount":159056,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":165559.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614935,"comment":null},{"amount":100.42,"local_amount":171922,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":178951.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568877,"comment":null},{"amount":102.76,"local_amount":175933,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":183126.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780200,"comment":null},{"amount":105.17,"local_amount":180038,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":187399.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188595,"comment":null},{"amount":107.61,"local_amount":184239,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":191772.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T15:54:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333583,"name":"Iveth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Iveth  de 48 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al sur de la ciudad con su esposo y sus 3 hijos en las edades de 20 a 23 a\u00f1os.

She has business where she sells stationery, school supplies, and office supplies.  Iveth started this business less than two years ago after having worked at a stationery shop for 18 years.  After accumulating a wealth of experience, she finally established her own business which now generates important income for maintaining her household.  Her first source of capital was her savings and a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Iveth has now received three loans from the organization and the money was used to increase her capital.  As a result, she has become known in the marketplace and has achieved a great deal of autonomy.

She manages an accounts receivable period of 30 days, an inventory turnover period of 17 days, and sales profitability of no less than 30%.

Her goal is to enlarge the business and to do some home improvements because in future she plans to add a second story to separate the living quarters from the business.\r\n\r\nWhile Luz Marina works to reach her goals, she manages a profit margin of 47% from which we can project potential growth and augur a successful investment of her Kiva loan that she\u2019ll use to buy oil, rice, corn and other ingredients to prepare her lunches and she\u2019ll also buy chairs and tables to offer improved customer comfort.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.05,"image":{"id":864472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for food preparation and also to buy tables and chairs for improved customer comfort.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52938},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59774},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61168},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62596},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64056},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":65551},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67080},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68645},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70247},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":71886},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73564},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82495}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.78,"local_amount":52938,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":53063.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614948,"comment":null},{"amount":33.62,"local_amount":59774,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":59915.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568890,"comment":null},{"amount":34.41,"local_amount":61168,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":61313.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780210,"comment":null},{"amount":35.21,"local_amount":62596,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62744.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188608,"comment":null},{"amount":36.03,"local_amount":64056,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":64208.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324819,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T11:42:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333596,"name":"Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel de 51 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la venta de refrescos en el barrio 7 de Abril, donde habita con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus tres hijos en las edades de 17 a 28 a\u00f1os.
