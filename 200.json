He has worked in the family business alongside his parents since he was 16 years old, buying up raw wool fleece. He is currently still doing this, but now does it on his own, thereby helping out with the family expenses. Paulo buys raw wool from local sheep farmers and later takes it to other cities such as Cuzco and Tacna to be sold. He has been in business for 2 years and what he likes most about it is that he can continue the family tradition. He hopes that in the future his business grows and he can collect even more wool fleece to sell in other places. For Paulo, the most difficult part of his job is collecting the fleece because he has to travel to many faraway places, but even so, he is willing to put all his effort into reaching his goals. This is his second loan with MFP. With his first loan he was very punctual with repayments and expects to do the same now as well. He is well-liked in his communal bank because he is always very respectful to the other members. With the 1,500 soles he requests he will increase his working capital so he can buy more raw wool fleece and sell to more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":298422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-05T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012386,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595974,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990238,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211362,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640870,"comment":null},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":262.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080339,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T22:42:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99643,"name":"Carlota","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlota es una mujer que siempre ha luchado por salir adelante, a sus 59 a\u00f1os ha conseguido tener su propia casa, todav\u00eda tiene muchas fuerzas para seguir trabajando y velar por el bienestar de su \u00fanica hija, Nery de 20 a\u00f1os.

She joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.) to get capital to start a business and gain more income. Her membership in ASHI has impacted her life, especially her confidence. She was able to earn respect from others. She applied for this loan to buy a pig for fattening and to buy rice to sell. In the future, she wants to expand her pigpen so she can raise more pigs and she wants to continue selling rice in order to keep her regular customers.

S., 61, has been selling fresh fish for more than four years. He usually sells fish that he buys from fisherman. He uses his old motorcycle to transport the fish. He can generate an income of approximately $5 per day to feed his family. He is married to Mrs. Yan, 56, who helps support the family by growing rice. This couple has four children; three are married, and two are employed; one is a construction worker and the other is a mobile phone repairer in Phnom Penh.

She can buy a skirt at about 2,000 USH and she can resell it at about 3,500 USH.  Usually she sells her skirts at the local market where she pays 500 USH rent per day.  Annet has been in this business for about 10 years now.  She works alone at her location, but her husband has a different stall at the market.  The work that she and her husband do, supports their four children. Since their children range from ages 17 to 5, they are all currently in school.  This means there is a heavy burden for the parents to carry. Annet says that although she could still be in the skirt-selling business without loans, the loans allow her to reduce her expenses. When she uses loans she is able to buy more skirts when she goes to Kampala.  This gives her more selection and reduces transport costs. In this loan cycle, Annet is requesting a loan of 300,000 to purchase a large stock of skirts.

Besides this work, he is also involved in breeding goats.  Ismatullo has 2 years of experience in this business.  When well-taken care of, goats can breed twice per year, making this a profitable business.  This is why Ismatullo decided to obtain a loan to help him purchase several purebred goats.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

Her husband Jerry makes buko (coconut) juice which he sells in the nearby school. Mary Ann does laundry for her neighbors just to help her husband. When she heard about ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.) entering their village to provide loans to mothers with dreams of putting up a business, she did not think twice before joining the organization to get capital. \r\n\r\nMary Ann wants to venture into selling rice, dried fish, kerosene, and chicken. She applied for this loan to purchase the mentioned items to increase their income. She hopes to establish a successful grocery store in future and to stop doing laundry in order to take care of her children and business at home. She is positive that with her initial capital accessed through ASHI and KIVA, her dreams of sending her children to a university will be achieved.

They have four children: Cristina - 19 years old and Barbie - 18 years old are already college students; Beejay -14 years old, a high school student and John Lloyd, in the elementary level. They live in a village where furniture-making is the major source of income of the residents. She is grateful that her husband is also helping her in her business.

They live simply in Allinguigan 3rd, Ilagan, Isabela. <P>\r\n\t\r\nTerisita and her husband started their business 15 years ago and they are now generating a monthly income of PHP 2,000.  She can say that her success in this kind of business is through patience and her positive attitude.  To further improve her business, she would like to request the loan amount of PHP 7,000 that she will use to buy wood and other materials they needed in making furniture.  Said amount will be of great help in pursuing her business and generating more income. She is hoping that someday her children will finish their studies thanks to their small enterprise.  <P>\r\n\r\nTeresita is happy that her family has a harmonious relationship.

is engaged in a furniture-making business. She and her family live in Allinguigan 3rd, Ilagan, Isabela. She is 38 years old and is married to Felipe, who serves as a village captain. They have four children who are all studying: Ricky Mark - 16 years old, a graduating high school student; Ceener - 15 years old, 3rd-year high school; Peejay, 12 years old, also in high school; and the youngest, Loraine - 10 years old, an elementary student.\r\n <p>\r\nJocelyn and her husband are business partners in managing their small business. To pursue her plan of purchasing wood and other materials they need in furniture making, she would like to borrow a loan amount of PHP 8,000. This amount will serve as her business capital and hopefully she can also use it for business expansion. She hopes that she can have more products to display in their shop but they could not do so before because of limited resources.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a mother, Jocelyn wants to send all her children to college and see them finish their studies. She hopes that through their business, they can fulfill their dreams for their children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":299091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Although her husband runs a small carpentry shop, their income was not adequate to pay the family\u2019s monthly expenses, which is especially burdensome with two children attending university. Hence, she decided to start a small private business to boost her family's income. She rents a small stall in the local shopping mall and sells wool and cashmere products. She frequently travels to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and purchases wool and cashmere products wholesale. In the future, she would like to diversify her business by opening a small cafeteria at the mall. She requests a loan to purchase more wool and cashmere products for her stall."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":299159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more wool and cashmere products ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Tsetserleg, Arvayheer","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2009-04-06T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Battsetseg","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":103600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44638878,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":103600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53041035,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":103600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63265411,"comment":null},{"amount":5.88,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-16T00:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8702.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73706632,"comment":null},{"amount":70.49,"local_amount":100705,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-16T00:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104330.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73706633,"comment":null},{"amount":107.83,"local_amount":154046,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":159591.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87136246,"comment":null},{"amount":25.92,"local_amount":37026,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T09:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":38358.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97050684,"comment":null},{"amount":279.88,"local_amount":399823,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":414216.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103896333,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-07T05:38:08Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T15:28:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99781,"name":"Arline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arline T. is a 35 year old mother of five.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":299161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Amriddin is dedicated to the production of dairy cattle. With a lot of effort and sacrifice he carries out this work every day for the purpose of improving the conditions of his family and bringing the daily bread to his table. At the same time, he is saving for the improvement of his dwelling, which needs a lot of help because it is in a bad state but which, little by little, he has come to improve. His family admires him for the fact that his multiple efforts have permitted him to bring food to his home and that in addition, Amriddin has managed to keep his three children in school.\r\n<p>\r\nThe need that this gentleman faces is to invest in the development of his business through the purchase of cows. In this he hopes that IMON International, with the help of Kiva, will offer him the loan to help him to do well along with his family.\r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Vali dedicates himself to the business of raising livestock. He distinguishes himself by having a lot of experience when it comes to livestock. He supports his spouse and four children and also provides for their education. It is important to note that thanks to his hard work he has been able to give his children his support so that they can get ahead. Vali is hoping for the assistance of IMON with the goal of obtaining a loan of $500. This will allow him to purchase young cattle to increase his herd, so as to earn more income. Both Vali and his loving family will benefit from this loan.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She used to make the humintas by hand, grinding them with the force of a wooden mallet, but now she has purchased an electric mill to grind them.  \r\n\r\nThe greatest hope of Jenny and Erick is to be able to give their child a good education so that he will grow up to be a good and responsible person.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":299264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of corn and an electric grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-04-07T05:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Grisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":465.35},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":470.45},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":475.6},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":480.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":486.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":491.41},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":496.8},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502.24},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":507.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":513.31},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":518.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":524.63},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":530.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":536.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.41},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":198.85,"local_amount":1358.03,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978969,"comment":null},{"amount":290.69,"local_amount":1985.22,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439651,"comment":null},{"amount":378.89,"local_amount":2587.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2650.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950172,"comment":null},{"amount":156.57,"local_amount":1069.19,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167112,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-07T21:39:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99842,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah K. is fifty years old.

When she has orders from her customers or from people that she knows, she lets them buy on credit and make payments to her.  When the payment date arrives, she goes to their houses or workplaces to collect her money.  She got the idea to start this business five years ago, when she wanted to increase her home\u2019s income.  What she likes most about her job is getting to know many people and her client base is increasing.

These people have confidence in her and have become her loyal customers.

Her four children are grown up, but have not been able to complete their education.  Margarita is still supporting them in their studies and hopes they become working professionals someday.  Margarita sells cosmetics and will use this loan to purchase cosmetics that her clients have specially requested, but also to sell clothing.  Margarita thinks that selling clothing will generate larger profits for her, since clothes can be purchased in bulk at a smaller price and sold for a larger profit margin. \r\n<p>\r\nPlease help us to continue supporting these entrepreneurs through this Kiva loan.

E. is a 39-year-old mother of two. Her husband Miguel is a carpenter. She helps her husband in raising their kids by doing laundry for her neighbors. She joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.) to get capital for her new venture.

He has a high school education.  Kudratkul keeps several cows at home.  In his yard he has a big garden where he grows tomatoes and other seedlings.

I have three kids: two sons and one daughter. My elder son works in a factory on a monthly wage and my younger son works in a shoe shop as a salesman. My daughter reads in the 10th standard. I have successfully repaid my first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan).  Now I am applying again for a loan to buy another motorbike to expand my husband\u2019s rented motorbikes business. \r\n\r\nI am the group leader of one other woman from my locality. Najma baji wants a loan to buy scrap for her scrap business. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.

\n","en":"Abduhalil lives in the mountains. Its a good place to maintain livestock for his home and business. From a young age he turned animals out to pasture; now, having experience in raising animals to market weight, he himself buys and sells livestock. Everyone in the village keeps livestock. He and his neighbors alternate taking the animals to pasture in the mountains where there is food (grass). They agree on whose turn it is to take cows to pasture and goats to the meadow. So for one month Abduhalil, or another of his neighbors, tend the animals, to protect them from wolves another any other dangerous situations. \r\nHe is a bookkeeper for the village council. He began working with Microinvest a year ago. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":299597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-08T03:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abduhalil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":811.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084582,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":811.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000815,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T03:53:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99966,"name":"Faalanu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faalanu K. is 44 years old and married with 5 children.

He has been a Microinvest client since 2007. He received his first loan to purchase livestock feed and cows. Now he already has cows and goats. He takes the cows and other livestock to pasture far from home. The animals love the young grass that is growing up in the mountains so he and his neighbors lead the animals there to graze. The livestock may stay in the mountains through the end of summer, as long as the grass (or other food) lasts. The animals which remain at the house are those that will be sold. \r\n\r\nNizomiddin also works for the village council. The salary is very small, but does qualify him for a pension, and earns him respect among the town residents. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":299606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-08T03:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nizomiddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":811.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084583,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":811.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000816,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T17:36:33Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":99974,"name":"Meafou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meafou I. is 52 years old and married with 9 children.

Lahore city is famous for its historical places and Punjabi foods. Munawar baji is the mother of three kids: two sons and one daughter. Her elder son runs a tailoring center. The others are enrolled in school and are getting an education. Munawar baji\u2019s husband runs a fruit-selling business. He sells seasonal fruits to the fruit sellers and also goes to the different areas and announces his products in a loud voice. Munawar baji operates a sewing clothes business. She sews clothes for her neighbors and charges them different rates. If the customer orders simple stitching, she charges $2 and if the customer asks for designer clothes, she charges $3. She saves her income in a committee and plans to renovate her house with the committee amount. She has successfully repaid her two loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy more seasonal fruits to expand her husband\u2019s fruit-selling business. \r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of three other women from her locality. Janat baji wants a loan to buy thread to sell. Safia baji wants a loan to buy a juicer machine for her juice corner. Jamila baji wants a loan to buy material (colored thread, clothes, sketches) to make dresses for her boutique. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":299608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Her family lives in Arhanghay, one of the central provinces of Mongolia. Together with her husband, Togtohbayar, she runs a dairy food stall year round. They also run a butcher shop in the winter and spring at the local market. When they started their business in 2006, their working capital was two million tugrugs ($1.00 USD= 1,500 MNT).

Married mothers of at least 8 children, they are on average 50 years old and are either related to each other or neighbors. They sell clothes, shoes, and jewelry. In order to rectify not having enough funds for their business, the members of the Kokadi\u00e8 group turned to Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program five years ago. The loan amount has gone from 50,000 CFA francs at the first loan to 125,000 CFA francs for the twelfth group loan. The current loan will be used to buy in-style clothes and jewelry at wholesale to be resold. The women of the Kokadi\u00e8 group stock up at the market in Bamako (the capital of the republic of Mali). They sell their products at the large market in Koutiala where they have space (kiosks or a converted shed). With this new loan, they plan on earning 140,000 CFA francs each over the term.

In 2005, she became a member of the TYF Fund and used a loan to invest in the family business selling pork.  Each day, her husband Duy\u1ec7t goes and buys a pig which they butcher, then Mrs. Nh\u1ecb sells the pork to residents of the local community.  Currently, this is the main source of income for the family, earning them 3,000,000 VND (172 USD) per month.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD) to invest in her pork business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

As for the shea butter, it is purchased in the villages and stored for resale at the market for cash.\r\n\r\nDuring this loan cycle, each member of the group expects to make a profit of 55,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family and the remainder will be invested in the business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":299699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy shea butter and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":118822.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621183,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":59411.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020143,"comment":null},{"amount":120.82,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":59411.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242898,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":59411.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678583,"comment":null},{"amount":120.85,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":59411.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-08T17:19:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100035,"name":"Le Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 hai con \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh.

Fakoye is a leaf-based condiment highly sought after by an ethnic group, the Sonrals, from the north of Mali and tchapalo is a local alcoholic beverage made from millet.\r\n\r\nThe group members joined the Soro Yiriwaso credit program three years ago to strengthen their business funds. The loan amounts have gone from 50,000 FCFA for the first loan to 150,000 FCFA for the fifth group loan.\r\n\r\nThis current loan will be used to buy sacks of fakoye that will be resold in Gao (the seventh region of Mali) and sacks of millet that will be turned into tchapalo and sold from home. This operation of transforming millet into tchapalo is a skill handed down from generation to generation by the Bobo women.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan they each expect to make a profit of 170,000 FCFA for the loan cycle, which will be used to repay the loan interest and handle everyday family expenses. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":299702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fakoye and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bor\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabr\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":254034.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621184,"comment":null},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020144,"comment":null},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242899,"comment":null},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678585,"comment":null},{"amount":258.35,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T08:04:38Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100037,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H. n\u0103m nay 42 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 hai con \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

For social reasons, A\u00efssata didn\u2019t have the chance to go to school, which explains her quick interest in earning money, notably commerce, which she learned from her mother. After having tried different businesses, she opted to sell diverse items in the sales of plastics, sounbala (a natural condiment), and other items for the last 11 years. Mrs. A\u00efssata is well sought by her clients from both within and outside of Mali (i.e., the C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Burkina Faso). To increase the size of her business and meet the needs of her clientele, A\u00efssata decided just 2 months ago to join microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, where she is on her first individual loan. She plans to buy 20 packages of plastic items, 5 baskets of sounbala and other miscellaneous items with this loan. She stocks up at the large market in Koutiala and makes her sales in Koutiala, Burkina Faso and the C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire to a clientele consisting of both women and men. She plans to earn a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA francs, which she will use to repay her loan, pay for her family\u2019s needs, and continue with the business with the rest.<br

Mrs. C\u1eady has participated in the TYM Fund since 2005. Before she joined the Fund, her family depended upon fishing for their income.  Since joining the Fund, she has used her loans to invest in a business selling bamboo.  This business is now doing rather well and earns the family an income of 3,000,000 VND (172 USD)  per month.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1150 USD) to buy more bamboo, which they can sell to residents of the local community.  This will enable Mrs. C\u1eady and her family to increase their income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

They average 47 years of age and 5 children. The members of the group live in large extended traditional families in the Konda village (prefecture of San, in the S\u00e9gou region, Republic of Mali). They got acquainted through bonds of neighborhood and kinship. They run very similar businesses, namely transforming n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts into \"sounbala\" (a food condiment very much appreciated in Mali) for selling. To meet an ever-increasing customer demand, the Djiguiya group sought to solve his problems by joining Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, from which it is seeking its second solidarity loan (group loan). The previous loan was repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts in Sikasso, in order to transform them into sounbala. It is then dried and packaged, before being wholesaled for cash in Mopti (Fifth region in the Republic of Mali). During this loan cycle, they hope to turn a profit of XOF 65'000 (ca US$ 130) each, to be used to repay the loan and to provide for their extended families. The remainder will be invested in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":299723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts to make soubala (a food condiment very much appreciated in Mali)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kayata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gadena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kariya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gadena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":135211.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621190,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67605.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020150,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67605.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242905,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67605.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678597,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67605.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112528,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-09T21:39:19Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100052,"name":"Soklay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Soklay H., 47, and her husband, Mr. Sokun Chea, 53, live in a small village off of National Road Number Two about twenty kilometers south of Phnom Penh and have eight children: one son and seven daughters.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Husen has always been dedicated to agriculture together with his wife who is pictured. He is 48 years old, married and has 5 children. As his activity has always been focused on making the land produce, the loans requested have generally been spent on necessary supplies to obtain a good production. In the future Husen expects to have his own working capital which will allow him to cover costs and provide the ability to buy more land in order to increase production and grow as a farmer. \n\nHusen needs a loan of $400 USD to go on purchasing farming supplies for his crop.\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account, and most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She hopes to make a monthly profit of 30,000 F CFA which she will use to help her husband cover certain family expenses. <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to have a home of her own.  \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":299784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"purchasing dried fish for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batoma   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.86,"local_amount":42857.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":45655.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621199,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":22827.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020159,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":22827.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242914,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":22827.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678615,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":22827.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112537,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":22828.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028131,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T19:02:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":100100,"name":"Filbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filbert Jimutumba runs a food shop in the Mnyamani ward in Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania.

a single mother with two children, has a farm upon which she grows cassava, a popular root vegetable in Cameroon.  Since 2008, she has been a member of GHAPE, one of Kiva\u2019s microfinance partners, and this current loan will be her second from the organization. \r\n\r\nThis loan of 40,080 CFA will help Esther pay for the clearing and tilling of her farmland, and she is confident that her business will continue to do well because cassava is always in demand within her community.  In addition, with the profits of her loan, Esther plans to expand her cassava-selling business.\r\n\r\nEsther appreciates GHAPE\u2019s manageable repayment plan and services, which includes the provision of interest when a borrower chooses to save money.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

Having lacked the chance to advance in school due to societal reasons, she got started in the business of dyed damask fabrics and their sales.  She learned how to do this from a friend over ten years ago.  She is in high demand by her customers, who are composed essentially of women, for the quality of her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nGiven the location of her shop, found along one of the main arteries of the city of Sikasso, she receives many customers.  She also ships her dyed damask to Abidjan (capital of the Cote d\u2019Ivoire) by special order.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to do better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on her first individual loan.   \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy eight bolts of white damask, ten containers of dye of different colors, ten packets of caustic soda, ten cloth suits for men, five bolts of light-weight cloth, ten containers of ointment, etc.  She supplies herself in Bamako and then resells the goods in her shop, not far from the Sikasso bus station.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He is 62 years old, married and has four children.  For the past twenty years he has raised large-horned cattle.  His children are grown and have their own families.

In addition, Paul is helping the community by purchasing the plantain stems from fellow neighbors.  \r\n\r\nAll three of his children are under the age of fifteen, so the profits of his business will go toward his children's school fees and to expand his farming business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.
