With a living cost of 30,000 per day they can still save a little. The loan will be used to increase the working capital. They receive an increase of orders during the month of Ramadan.

To begin, he rented a two room facility, which he equipped with 5 computers and an Internet connection. He also provided his clients with software and sold parts for computers and cellphones. Naturally, computers become outdated as fast as technological progress marches forward and currently Siyavush is a situation where he has to either update his equipment or lose his clients. The latter would be detrimental to the well being of his family since the income from the business is used to support his parents and five siblings.

Starting with an investment of only Rp. 700,000, Putu Sorti bought one sow which along with her litter resides in a simple stall.  Every four months a litter of between six and twelve piglets is born, and they are ready to sell two months later.  Daily necessary expenses for the pigs can be Rp 8,000.  When they are two months of age, the piglets can be sold for a total of Rp. 2,400,000, or 200,000 x 12 piglets.  From that sale, Putu Sorti earns Rp. 912,000 every six month in profit, after subtracting the pig feed expenses which amount to Rp. 1,488,000 per 6 months.  With these profits, Putu Sorti can maintain the necessities of her house, as well as slowly but surely make improvements to her house, which is still in the state of being constructed.

Sedangkan pinjaman yang diperoleh dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 dipergunakan untuk membeli 1 bibit penginduk dan satu lagi bibit untuk penggemukan, diharapkan nantinya hasil yang diperoleh lebih meningkat lagi ,sehingga dapat pula meningkatkan kesejahteraan keluarga."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase a baby female pig and another piglet -- Membeli induk babi dan bibit babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T02:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T03:07:40Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:22:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86407,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100253,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119056,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:16:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138514,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:35:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164668,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191324,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T03:07:40Z","paid_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20153,"name":"Ni Putu Yasi","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"The lives of three children who now sit on a school bench represent an important matter for Ni Putu Yasi, especially as her husband is only a farmer without expansive fields, which inevitably means low earnings.  The house in which she lives is very simple and still in a semi-permanent state, although they own it free and clear.  For everyday expenses Putu Yasi needs Rp.20,000.  In order to get on top of these issues, Putu Yasi diligently began a pig breeding business three years ago.  With starting capital of only Rp.800,000, Putu Yasi bought one sow.  Every four months the sow gives birth to a litter of between five and eleven piglets, and after the piglets are two months old they are ready to be sold.  One piglets sells for Rp.200,000, so the earnings of the sale can reach Rp.2,200,000 (@200,000 x 11).  From that sale, profits can be up to Rp.700,000 every six months, after subtracting for the feed (Rp.1,500,000 every six months).  These profits are used by Putu Yasi to pay her children's school fees as well as to add to her house.  Putu Yasi is very pleased with the loan from Dinari, because with it, she can add to her business.  Now Putu Yasi has begun to fatten up two pigs, and the loan of Rp.1,300,000 will be used to puchase pig feed with the hope that the profits will be good and Putu Yasi's children can attend school through a higher grade level. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMenghidupi 3 orang anak yang kini sudah duduk dibangku sekolah merupakan hal yang berat bagi Ni Putu Yasi, apalagi suaminya hanyalah seorang petani yang ladangnya tidak begitu luas,otomatis penghasilannya pun tidak banyak.Rumah yang ditempatipun sangat sederhana dan masih dalam tingkat semipermanen,tetapi sudah menjadi milik sendiri. Sedang untuk keperluan sehari-hari Putu Yasi harus mengeluarkan uang sebesar Rp.20.000. Supaya masalah ini bisa diatasi maka sejak 3 tahun yang lalu Putu Yasi mulai menekuni usaha berternak babi.Modal awal hanya Rp.800.000,Putu Yasi membeli 1 ekor penginduk. Setiap 4 bulan sekali  babi penginduk ini melahirkan anak bisanya 5 sampai 11ekor,dan selang 2 bulan kemudian anak-anak babi ini sudah bisa dijual.Satu ekor  dijual seharga Rp. 200.000 ,jadi hasil penjulan semuanya sebesar Rp.2.200.000 ( @ 200.000 x 11 ). Dari penjualan ini keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar  Rp.700.000 per 6 bulan ,setelah dikurangi biaya pakan sebesar Rp.1.500.000 selama 6 bulan.Keuntungan ini dipakai oleh Putu Yasi untuk biaya sekolah anak-anaknya juga untuk mencukupi keperluan rumah tangga. Putu Yasi sangat senang dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari,karena dengan adanya pinjaman ini Putu Yasi dapat mengembangkan usahanya karena sekarang Putu Yasi mulai memelihara babi penggemukan 2 ekor,dan pinjaman sebesar Rp.1.300.000 dipakai untuk membeli pakan ternak dengan harapan keuntungan yang didapat lebih banyak dan anak-anak Putu Yasi bisa sekolah ketingkat yang lebih tinggi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase feed -- Membeli pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu Yasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T04:32:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:22:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86408,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100254,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119055,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138517,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164674,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191325,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T04:32:26Z","paid_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20154,"name":"Sevinj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Sevinj is a low income, vulnerable woman.

So in 2003, she and her husband made up a business plan to expand her waste recycling business. Instead of just buy & resell, they would open a factory to produce goods made from recycled material.

Fatmeh prefers to come to Al Majmoua to resolve her credit issues, because she wants to preserve her family's pride. She does not want the people of her community to look at her parents as if they are asking for charity. Fatmeh is part of a group loan with other women from the same village. They named their group \"Fatmeh\" because she was the one who had the idea of contacting our Institution. A group is usually constituted of self-chosen women, living in vulnerable conditions, mostly in rural areas. The group lending is based on incremental increase of loan amount and group solidarity to guarantee repayment. The strength of the group loan is that it encourages the collaboration approach in the borrowing community. It is a very powerful tool towards economic empowerment of women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":71943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To repay personal and family debts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Abbassieh - South","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T02:59:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T10:29:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79978,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T10:28:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":95462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-01-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113933,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-02-11T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":133489,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-03-11T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155785,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180057,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T02:59:21Z","paid_date":"2008-04-11T09:13:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20239,"name":"Murad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Murad S. is 24 years old and lives in Khaladj village in the Salyan region.

farming business after she got married to I Gusti Putu Tinda . Up to now she is active in the business, since with pig farming, this family of 5 could fulfill daily needs. Her husband's income as a tenant farmer is not sufficient to cover schooling expenses for her 3 children:  Agung Ayu Damayanti, Agung Lanang Putra dan Ayu Cempaka Dewi. However wih her additional efforts of pig farming, her children are now in Highschool, Middle school, and Grade school. Before Dinari's loan she only has a capital of Rp300,000 (about US$33) to buy 2 local piglets, that she raised the traditional way, by feeding them banana tree trunk, and talas leaves which grows around her home.  With that limited capital she often has to sell her pigs before harvest, because of urgent family needs or to buy food for the family. With additional loan of Rp1,500,000 (about $165), Agung could buy 3 more piglets, and the rest to buy few sacks of wheat and rice shell clippings to feed her animals. Hence the growth would be enhanced, and income would increase to Rp3,000,000 ($330) per 6 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan kandang yang sangat sederhana , dinding bambu dan atap daun kelapa yang di anyam. Agung begitu panggilan akrab dari Anak  Agung Ayu Sudaryati  yang telah  memulai usaha beternak babi sejak menikah dengan I Gusti Putu Tinda . Sampai saat ini Agung masih tetap menekuni usaha itu karena dengan beternak babi keluarga yang beranggotakan 5 orang ini dapat memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari hari . Hasil suami yang hanya sebagai buruh tani tidak cukup untuk membiayai pendidikan tiga orang anaknya Yakni : Agung Ayu Damayanti, Agung Lanang Putra dan Ayu Cempaka Dewi. Namun berkat ketekunan Agung dalam memelihara babi, kini anak-anaknya telah duduk di bangku sekolah SMA, SMP dan SD .Sebelum mendapat pinjaman dari Dinari,  Agung hanya mengandalkan modal Rp 300.000.- untuk membeli 2 ekor bibit babi lokal yang di pelihara secara tradisional yaitu dengan makanan batang pisang dan daun talas yang tumbuh di sekitar rumahnya . Dengan modal yang sangat terbatas itu sering  kali Agung harus menjual ternaknya sebelum waktu panen karena kebutuhan keluarga yang mendesak atau tak sanggup membeli pakan. \r\n       Kini  Agung telah mendapatkan tambahan modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp 1.500.000.- Dengan  tambahan modal itu   Agung mulai membeli bibit baru lagi sebanyak 3 ekor dan sisanya di belikan beberapa sak dedak gandum dan dedak padi untuk pakan ternaknya Pertumbuhan babinya cukup baik dan hasil yang di perolehpun sangat lumayan yaitu Rp. 3.000.000.- \/ 6

With an initial capital of Rp1,300,000 Ketut Warni raised 2 mother pigs. Every day she fed those 2 pigs 2X\/day Konsentrat (local brand) mixed with banana tree trunk at a cost of Rp15,000 (about US$1.70). She has been working on this business for 3 years, since her husband's income as a tenant farmer is not sufficient to pay for family expenses. Especially Ketut Warni has a child that now goes to Middle school. Every 4 months the mother pigs give birth to up to 10 piglets, after 2 months those piglets were ready to be sold. From that sales up to Rp 1,900,000 (about US$209) at Rp190,000X10, she could profit Rp800,000 (about $88)\/6 months. This profit is used to pay for child school expenses,  and other family needs. Ketut Warni is happy that with a loan from Dinari for Rp 1,300,000 (about $143-150 depending on exchange rate fluctuation) she could expand her business by buying another mother pig for Rp800,000 (about $88), while the rest Rp500,000 (about $55) would be used to buy animal feed. She hope her additional income and profit would increase so that it would be sufficient to pay for daily living expenses,\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nKetut Warni tinggal disebuah rumah sederhana semi permanen di desa di Berawantangi. Dengan modal awal Rp.1.300.000 Ketut Warni memelihara 2 ekor babi penginduk . Setiap hari  babi tersebut diberi makan  Konsentrat dicampur dengan batang pisang , sebanyak 2 kali sehari dan biaya yang dikeluarkan untuk 2 ekor babi tersebut sebanyak Rp.15.000.  Usaha ini ditekuninya semenjak 3 tahun yang lalu mengingat penghasilan suami sebagai seorang petani tidak mampu mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga . Apalagi Ketut Warni mempunyai satu orang anak yang kini sudah duduk dibangku SMU. Setiap 4 bulan sekali babi penginduk tersebut melahirkan anaknya .Dan sekarang salah satunya sudah melahirkan anak sebanyak 10 ekor, setelah 2 bulan maka anak-anak babi sudah siap dijual. Dari hasil penjualan sebanyak Rp. 1.900.000 ( @ 190.000 x 10) maka keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar Rp.800.000 setiap enam bulan sekali. Keuntungan ini pergunakan untuk biaya sekolah anaknya juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga Ketut Warni . Sekarang Ketut warni sangat senang dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 karena dengan pinjaman tersebut Ketut Warni bisa pengembangkan usahanya dengan membeli 1 ekor babi penginduk lagi seharga Rp.800.000 ,sedangkan sisanya sebesar Rp.500.000 dipergunakan untuk modal pakan ternak. Hal ini dilakukan agar hasil atau keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak dan dapat mencukupi biaya hidup sehari-hari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy mother pig and animal feed<p>Membeli induk babi dan pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-05T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Warni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T05:26:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T06:26:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70386,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86646,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:27:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100306,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119108,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139693,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164712,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T05:26:26Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20259,"name":"Elbrus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Elbrus is a 37-year-old farmer.

With a capital of Rp750,000 (about US$83), Komang Wati raised a mother pig. This pig was raised very simple and traditional. The food given was a mixture of rice shell clippings and pounded banana tree trunk . That pig was fed 2x\/day, and the feed expenses per pig is Rp6500 (about 72 cents). In 4 months the pig gave birth to 9 piglets. She sold them for Rp1,575,000 (about $172) at Rp175,000(about $18)X9. After subtarcting Rp1,000,000 (about $110), her profit from this sale is Rp575,000 (about $62). She usd the profit to pay for her child's schooling expenses, who now sits in 7th grade; also to pay for other Komang Wati's household expenses, since her tenant farmer husband does not have a steady income. With a loan from Dinari in the amount of Rp1,300,000 (about $145), Komang Wati could expand her business, and expect to buy another mother pig for Rp800,000 (about $88), and 1 piglet for fattening for Rp250,000 (about $27.50); and the rest to buy animal feed. Komang Wati hopes that she could increase her profit, and make her family more prosperous.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nUsaha beternak babi sudah ditekuni Komang Wati sejak lama .Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.750.000, Komang Wati memelihara 1 ekor babi penginduk. Babi ini dipelihara dengan sangat sederhana dan tradisional. Makanan yang diberikan adalah campuran dedak padi dengan batang pisang yang sudah ditumbuk. Babi tersebut diberi makan 2 kali  dalam satu hari sehingga biaya yang diperlukan untuk satu ekor babi tersebut sebesar Rp.6.500. Dalam waktu 4 bulan babi ini sudah melahirkan anaknya sebanyak 9 ekor, Dan laku dijual seharga Rp.1.575.000 (@ 175.000 x 9 ) ,dari penjualan ini diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.575.000 ,Setelah dikurangi biaya sebesar Rp. 1.000.000 selama enam bulan. Keuntungan ini dipergunakan untuk biaya sekolah satu orang anaknya yang kini duduk dikelas 1 SMP, dan juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangga Komang Wati mengingat suaminya seorang petani yang penghasilannya tidak pasti setiap bulan. Dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari sebesar Rp. 1.300.000 Komang Wati dapat mengembangkan usahanya dengan membeli 1 ekor penginduk lagi seharga Rp.800.000 dan 1 ekor bibit babi penggemukan seharga Rp.250.000 ,sedangkan sisanya digunakan untuk menambah modal pakan ternak. Hal ini dilakukan Komang Wati dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak lagi dan kesejahteraan keluarga lebih baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy mother pig and piglet for fattening<p>Membeli induk dan bibit untuk penggemukkan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-05T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T06:44:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T06:28:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70387,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86647,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:27:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100304,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119110,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139696,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T06:44:32Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20265,"name":"Ilhem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilhem M.

Setiap hari babi tersebut diberi makan sebanyak 2 kali dengan makanan dedak padi dicampur dengan tumbukan batang pohon pisang . Dan setiap 4 bulan sekali maka babi ini melahirkan anaknya sebanyak 10 ekor, 2 bulan kemudian anak babi ini suda bisa dijual seharga Rp.2.000.000 ( @200.000 x 10 ),dari penjualan ini diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.900.000 selama 6 bulan sekali . Dan sekarang babi penginduk ini sedang hamil tua lagi.Dari keuntungan inilah Putu Budiantari dapat membiaya sekolah kedua anaknya dan juga biaya hidup keluarga. Sedangkan pinjaman dari Dinari dipergunakan untuk membeli satu ekor babi penginduk lagi seharga Rp. 1.000.000 dan sisanya untuk modal pakannya.Dengan harapan keuntungan dari memelihara 2 ekor penginduk akan lebih banyak,sehingga nantinya Putu Budiantari dapat menyekolahkan anaknya ke tingkat yang lebih tinggi"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy mother pig<p>Membeli induk babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-06T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu Budiantari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-20T15:11:03Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T06:48:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70389,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86649,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:27:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100307,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119109,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139695,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164715,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-06T15:11:03Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20269,"name":"Esmira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esmira E. has been operating a home goods store in the northeastern Azerbaijani town of Devechi for the last 10 years.

Her 3 children are married, and live separately from Wayan Ratih. Although elderly, Wayan Ratih has a forward spirit, and is persistent in her pig farming business. With a capital of Rp500,000 (about US$55) Wayan Ratih bought 2 piglets for fattening.  Every day she fed those piglets 2X, at a cost of Rp12,000 (about $1.40).  She raised them for 4 months\r\nand sold them both for Rp1,800,000 (about US$200). After expenses her profit was Rp550,000 (about $62) in 4 months time. From this profit Wayan Ratih could fulfill her household needs, since field income from her husband's tenant farming is not much. Loan from Dinari for Rp1,300,000 (about $150) will be used to buy another fattening piglet for Rp250,000 (about $28), the rest to buy animal feed for upcoming 4 months, with the hope that profit would increase so that Wayan Ratih could renovate her home little by little.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Wayan Ratih bersama suaminya tinggal disebuah rumah sederhana semipermanen di desa Berawantangi. Sedangkan ketiga orang anaknya sudah menikah dan tinggal terpisah dengan Wayan Ratih. Walaupun dalam usianya yang sudah tua namun Wayan Ratih tetap mempunyai semangat untuk terus maju dan menekuni usahanya beternak babi. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.500.000 Wayan Ratih membeli 2 ekor bibit babi yang nantinya dipelihara sebagai babi penggemukan . Setiap hari babi tersebut diberi makan 2 kali ,sehinggan biaya yang dikeluarkan sebesar Rp. 12.000. Babi ini dipelihara selama 4 bulan, dan laku dijual seharga Rp. 1.800.000 untuk dua ekor. Dari hasil penjulan ini diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.  550.000 dalam waktu 4 bulan. Dari keuntungan inilah Wayan Ratih dapat memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya karena penghasilan ladang suaminya sebagai seorang petani tidak banyak. Pinjaman yang didapat dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 dipergunakan oleh Wayan Ratih untuk membeli 1 ekor bibit penggemukan lagi seharga Rp. 250.000,sedangkan sisannya dipakai untuk biaya pakan ternak selama 4 bulan dengan harapan keuntungan yang didapat menjadi lebih banyak,sehingga nantinya Wayan Ratih bisa merenovasi rumahnya sedikit demi sedikit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":72002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feedstock<p>Membeli bibit babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-06T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Ratih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-20T14:29:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T06:50:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70390,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86650,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:27:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100308,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119111,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T01:04:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139699,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164719,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-06T14:29:58Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20272,"name":"Imran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imran S.

Their children are grown up and independent, each with their own family.  They began their business activities selling everyday items with financial support from their children.  Ater her husband retired, they wanted to be able to continue with their own business to cover the costs for the public services they received from the city.  The small shop is busy every day and they begin work early in the morning and continue until late at night, due to the constant presence of their neighbors.  To satisfy the demands of their customers, they need to expand the stock of items they offer.  For that, they need a loan of $400 which they will repay in 6 months.

Cetty is a loving and diligent mother.  She has 8 children, her youngest three still live with her and attend school at the city education center.  She works every day in a shop in her small home, which she set up with the help of her older children.  She also counts on a monthly income she gets from selling items in a small village near the Ucayali river, with the help of her oldest daughter who works as a teacher in that town.  With the combined income from these activities she is able to take good care of the children who still live with her.  After a careful evaluation, she has proposed that she increase the stock in her small shop to meet the requests of the families who live near the river, so they don't have to buy them in the market.  With this extra money, the family would be able to improve their quality of life and education.   She is requesting a loan of $500, which she will use to grow her business.   Let's help her realize her goals with our generous support. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCetty, es una amorosa y diligente madre, tiene ocho hijos y mantiene guarecidos en el seno de su hogar s\u00f3lo a tres de ellos; debido a que a\u00fan son muy peque\u00f1os y se encuentran estudiando en un centro educativo de su hermosa ciudad.

Con la suma de estos ingresos puede otorgarles bienestar a los ni\u00f1os que a\u00fan viven con ella.As\u00ed  mismo luego de haber hecho una evaluaci\u00f3n rigurosa se ha propuesto incrementar el stock de su peque\u00f1a bodega con el prop\u00f3sito de abastecer los pedidos que realizan mensualmente las familias de la peque\u00f1a localidad ubicada al margen del r\u00edo para evitar comprarlo en el mercado, con este incremento de dinero la familia tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1 acrecentar su nivel de vida y educaci\u00f3n siendo \u00e9ste el prop\u00f3sito primordial de esta sacrificada madre.

Virginia thinks that after twelve months, she'll have set aside sufficient money so as to begin her study of Marketing in a good university of Santo Domingo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":72281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy cosmetics such as hair repair products and skin care lotions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Nuevo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.566667 -71.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":66,"posted_date":"2007-10-05T17:35:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T22:53:49Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":325,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-11-20T10:31:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84311,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-12-20T17:12:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100141,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-01-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118985,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139164,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162216,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187388,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T22:53:49Z","paid_date":"2008-04-20T09:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20363,"name":"Sikolasitika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sikolasitika is sixty-three old and has eight children.

To successfully fulfill the basic needs of her family in all the activities that they do, she opened a small store in her house two years ago.  She had to sacrifice the development of the store because of her constant health problems caused by a uterine fibroma. Not long after finding out about the fibroma, she had to undergo surgery in a local clinic in order to save her life.  Rosa is mother to 4 children and now only the youngest, who is 13 years old, is in her care.  For this reason she wants to continue to strive. At present she is in better physical and financial condition and she has been able to find work lending small amounts of money to her neighbors, which allows her to buy certain necessities to support her family.  Nonetheless, she longs to once again open her little store in order to lend her services and satisfy the needs of the general public.  For this reason she is requesting a loan of $350, which will be the first step in her effort to see her dream succeed.  We support a woman who can overcome any obstacle with bravery.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural micro-enterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Harga per ekornya mencapai Rp. 350.000.- sampai dengan  Rp. 400.000,- Total penjualan seluruhnya dapat mencapai Rp. 3.000.000,-Keuntungan bersih mencapai Rp. 700.000,- setelah dikurangi semua pengeluaran untuk pakan. Dari pendapatan ini belum bisa menopang kehidupan keluarganya yang berjumlah 5 orang. Ni Kadek W. membutuhkan tambahan modal usaha Rp. 1.400.000.- Harapan kedepannya akan membeli  2 ekor  induk lagi  sehingga keuntungan akan lebih banyak lagi, sehingga dapat membantu pendapatan suami untuk mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":73019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-10T03:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-24T03:19:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-11-24T10:19:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85936,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100250,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119051,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:16:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138511,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:35:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164669,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190558,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-10T03:19:28Z","paid_date":"2008-04-24T09:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20522,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Ms. Nguyen Thi V., 39 years old, has joined TYM Fund since 2000.

is 34 years old, married and has four children. Two of her children are in secondary while two are in primary school. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From her one-room home, she makes envelopes. She finds colorful blue and pink paper that has been recycled from government forms. Very neatly, she folds the paper together. With a jar of paste and a wood stick, she seals the edges, leaving a pocket open on one end. She makes hundreds of these envelopes at a time. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a photo shop in downtown Kampala which pays her for the envelopes. The photo shop will use the envelopes to place one picture in each envelope.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe has been making envelopes for three years now. She is now also a member of a women\u2019s lending group, which is located in the Rabaga District of Kampala, Uganda.

A husband from Kt Suarti, initially bred 3 pigs only with the intention of supplementing his farming work. However after seeing the great prospect of this effort, he enthusiastically expanded this effort. Within a year a breeder sow usually produces twice, bearing 7 to 10 piglets, each piglet on the average is worth Rp 150.000 (about USD20). For 2 hours each day, he set aside time for this, in the morning between 6-7 and afternoon after returning from farming. Currently, he already own 4 breeder sows of the local breed. This loan will be used to purchase another sow and a male breeder pig. From his earnings he can save more thus able to pay for his 2 sons\u2019 education, already in primary and technical schools. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer. <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPak Ketut D., sebagai kepala keluarga bertanggung jawab atas kelangsungan hidup ketiga orang anaknya.

Dalam setahun 1 ekor induk babi bisa beranak 2 kali, dengan anak 7 - 10 ekor, sedangkan harga anak yang sudah siap di pisah rata-rata Rp 150.000 \/ekor. 2 jam sehari dia meluangkan waktunya, pagi mulai pukul 06.00 Wita s\/d jam 07.00 Wita dan sore setelah datang dari sawahnya.

Prior to getting involved with MLF MicroInvest she used to borrow from local money lenders at very high interest rates. After joining MLF MicroInvest in 2002 she obtained a loan to increase her sales, hoping that this will also help improve her standard of living.
