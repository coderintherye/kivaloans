Mariam is known for her good and tasty mankoucheh. Her clients are her friends and neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase raw materials for her bakery. This is her second loan cycle and she has always repaid on time.  She decided on this business because she wanted to supplement her family\u2019s income. In the future, she plans on opening a restaurant.

In spite of her children making their own way in life, Evelyn continues to strive to earn a living, not only for herself and her husband, but also because she wants to help her grandchildren have more opportunities.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Evelyn went into business to help her husband pay for the ever-increasing household expenses and to help with her children's school expenses. She started with a rice-retailing business, selling rice to people in her neighborhood and nearby villages, and this helped their family quite a lot. In 2004, with a pig-fattening business in mind, Evelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and went into what has turned out to be a good backyard venture for her and her family. Now, their small piggery business earns an average net profit of $88 a month.\r\n\r\nHer piggery business is doing quite well. In her previous loan she borrowed Php 17,000, which she used as additional capital for both her rice-retailing and her pig-fattening businesses. She was able to pay that loan off within its loan term without any delays. This time around she is borrowing another PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as working capital for her piggery.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is shown in the accompanying picture, posing in front of her backyard pigpens.\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

In addition to the stable salary that she and her husband earned from working at the biggest sugar mill in the island, Delia also owned and managed a restaurant that catered to and was patronized by the employees in the sugar mill. Then, because of many factors, including a sugar crisis and other economic downturns, the sugar mill closed down and let the majority of its employees go. Delia lost her business as a result.\r\n\r\nFortunately, severance pay from the company allowed Delia to start a small general store, from which she earned her daily income. With her hard work and diligence, Delia was able to recover from their financial downturn and in 2002, joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital. With help from this organization, her business continues to grow, and now earns a monthly profit which is a big help in defraying their household expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia has taken out and repaid a dozen loans from NWTF-PD. She plans to use this new loan to keep her general store well stocked at all times and continue to earn a good income for her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She is 59 years old, married and has three children who are 32 to 37 years old. Because of her determination, hard work and dedication to help her children finish their college education, she finally achieved this aspiration. Now she dreams to continue improving their quality of life, her most immediate objective being to buy one more motorcycle as a business asset and to repair their house in the future.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, Teresita was not sure if she and her husband would be able to provide well for their family. This was because she knew that her husband's income was just not enough to cover all the expenses of their family, which included the school expenses of their three children. This is why in January of 1991, Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow capital to start a business that could supplement her husband's earnings. She went through the necessary training seminar so that she could understand what was expected of her as an PD member. When she received her first loan, she started a general store adjacent to their family home. Because of its good location, it was able to earn a good income for her and her family.  At the next opportunity to start another business, Teresita went into rice retailing, sold dried fish and even charcoal to expand her product offerings and increase her income potential. She even bought a motorcycle as another source of income. Now she earns an average of 20,000 Philippine pesos per month, which is really a respectable income for a rural location.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 20,000, which she used as additional capital for her businesses. Having paid that, while maintaining her good credit standing, Teresita is now borrowing for her 17th cycle loan the same amount, Php 20,000, to be used as revolving capital for her business. Any income will used to buy the new motorcycle that she dreams to add to her ever-growing income sources.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He has been a member of U-IMCEC at the branch office of Baye Laye for several years.  He has already repaid six loans.  He has been in this business of tailoring since 1989.  But it was only since 2003 that he acquired his own workshop and has worked for himself.  He was born into a family of tailors and used to go to his older brother\u2019s shop regularly.  Thus, he chose this trade for the love of it.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s requesting a loan of 250,000 francs with the goal of rounding out his savings to acquire a new sewing machine and thus to be able to cope with the growing demand ahead of the Tabaski Festival and New Year\u2019s Day.  With this loan, he hopes to increase his monthly revenues by 250,000 francs.  His goal is to improve his savings considerably and to expand his workshop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Rosina, a rice and stew vendor in the community market, works very hard to support her child's basic needs.  She started her operation about three years ago, but her food production is low because of inadequate funds to support her business.

She lives with her husband and children in a traditional family with several households in the first district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Soon after dropping out of school in 6th class (education system of Mali), she very soon started earning revenues by opting for an apprenticeship dyeing cloth.  She learned this trade from one of her sisters-in-law 15 years ago.  Today, she enjoys a lot of experience and distinction.  She has an excellent command of the ins and outs of this business sector.  Her reputation extends beyond S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nTo dye cloth, she dilutes different modern and traditional dye products in hot water.  Then she soaks white fabrics in this water to give them the desired color.  The dyed fabrics are spread out on a rope to dry.  Next, she takes them to a tailor.  Once the clothing is sewn, it\u2019s washed and carefully wrapped.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, to realize bigger profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She is on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy 3 bolts of damask cloth.  She supplies herself locally and in Bamako from wholesalers.  And she sells to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she anticipates earning a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA.  This will allow her to help her husband and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, etc.)  Her ambition is to open a ready-to-wear clothing store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":423144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy bolts of \"rich\" damask ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T00:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Biba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152364,"comment":null},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991211,"comment":null},{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021481,"comment":null},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746281,"comment":null},{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778846,"comment":null},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961098,"comment":null},{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699291,"comment":null},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913249,"comment":null},{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180445,"comment":null},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476503,"comment":null},{"amount":104.55,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":45958.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476504,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T01:49:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150908,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is 56 years old.

Sales are made in cash and often on credit to customers composed of men and women at the marketplaces of Sikasso City, in homes, and door-to-door.  \r\n\r\nThe group members each anticipate earning an average monthly profit of 35,000 francs CFA.  A portion of the profits will be put into savings and used for family needs.  The other portion will be invested in the businesses.  Their ambition is to ask for bigger loans to satisfy their customers further.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":423149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T00:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873806,"comment":null},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763543,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152365,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991212,"comment":null},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021482,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67772.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746282,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T14:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150911,"name":"Samuel E.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers of a primary school in Sierra Leone. They have come to seek a loan of 10,500,000.00 SLL from SMT\/Shine on Sierra  Leone (one of Kiva's field partners) in order to meet some of their immediate financial needs. As teachers\u2019 salaries are usually small, SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone loans are very useful in helping them supplement their salaries. \r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Shine on Sierra Leone\/Kiva. This loan will certainly be of immense help to them. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone (especially for people in the teaching profession) they could not use such salaries to buy or do anything great. With a loan, however, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time. Some of them will use it to begin or continue building a house; others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or to pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use it to invest in businesses in order to complement their monthly salaries, and still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture and household goods.\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of teachers is Samuel E. W.. He is a teacher at the school and head of this group of teachers. He has been in the teaching profession for forty years now. Samuel is sixty-one years old and married to a businesswoman.

Maria has a business buying and selling clothing, new as well as used, which she sells in the streets, principally on order to people that she knows.  It should be noted that she works in a beauty salon called the Belleza Luz Marina salon, where she offers her products to her co-workers and customers of the salon.  This business began 5 years ago with very little working capital.  She was searching for a source of alternative income, since she had just had her first child and wanted to provide for him well.  She started out selling cosmetics, after that she started to invest in clothing and accessories; in addition she also sells jewelry, but only on order.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of more clothing, since it is now close to the Christmas season and Maria wants to invest and buy now when the prices are a little lower.  Her goal is to eventually have a store located in the market that sells a variety of items;  this would make it easier for her to provide economic support for herself and her two children.\r\n\r\n<br

She is 30 years old, married, and has 4 children (ages 14, 12, 8, and 5).  All of them attend school in the community and are in different graD. levels.\r\n<p>\r\nFor 5 years, Maricela has managed a business selling groceries and basic necessities.  Her shop has always been small because she never received the assistance of a loan.  Four months ago, she obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in the amount of 3000 MXN and used it to expand her store a little bit.  That loan has been repaid.  Today she will receive a second loan of 5000 MXN so that she can continue to develop her business.  The income from her store covers her family\u2019s expenses, while her husband\u2019s earnings are used to pay for their children\u2019s education.  He is employed at a soft drink company, but his salary is not enough to pay for all of the household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to access a loan, the group had to consist of 10 women from the same community.  Each member must engage in a productive business activity, since this is a prerequisite for receiving a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  With no previous credit experience, these ladies are pleased with the benefits they have received.  They hope to continue in their development because they want to be eligible for future business loans.  In addition, they are happy to be working with one another and hope they can continue as a group.    \r\n<p>\r\nThe breakdown of the group loan is as follows:\r\nMaricela Zu\u00f1iga A. requests 5000 MXN to sell food. \r\nDolores M. B. requests 3000 MXN to sell food.\r\nLucia A. R. requests 2000 MXN to sell food.\r\nAdalberta R. M. requests 1000 MXN to sell food.\r\nAgripina R. R. requests 8000 MXN to sell food.\r\nDioema Cris\u00f3stomo C. requests 8000 MXN to sell natural products.\r\nPaula Y. L. requests 6000 MXN to sell food.\r\nPetra D. Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez requests 8000 MXN to sell food.\r\nIsabel G. M. requests 2000 MXN to sell regional bananas.\r\nRoberta G. M. requests 3000 MXN to sell clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

E. attended a felt souvenirs training seminar with three friends in 2005, and they decided to begin their own business. Most of her products are sold to foreign tourists, but some are bought by local Mongolians. Since then, her business has grown steadily and her working capital has increased from 200,000 tugriks (~ $140 US) to 2,300,000 tugriks (~ $1,614 US). She credits her business success to her hard work and good customer service. She is requesting a 2,300,000 tugrik loan in order to purchase more wool felt and to increase her working capital to prepare for next year\u2019s tourist season.\r\n<p>\r\nE. is 41 years old and lives with her 10-year-old daughter in the Arhangai province of central Mongolia.

There is only one man in the group but he feels right at home with these strong hard-working ladies.  They all have a great sense of humor.\n\nThe president of the group, Tania Gladys, was born in in Quillabamba and is 53 years old and lives in Oropesa.  She is married and lives with her spouse and 2 children.  She has been selling bread for the last 9 years.  She will use this loan to buy more supplies for her bakery - flour, butter, sugar, etc. \n\nMost of the members are involved in making a special type of bread called \u201cchuta\u201d. Oropesa is the bread-making capital of the Cusco area.  Walking down the streets, the smell of bread permeates the air.  With this loan, most of the group members will grow their panader\u00edas, or bakeries, buying flour, sugar, and butter to make and sell more bread.  \n\nSome of the members also make chicha (a Peruivan drink maD. from corn) and will use the loan to buy more corn.

is 43 years old and has been married for 20 years.

As a result, he never finished primary school and hardly knows how to read or write. Like many dairy cow farmers in the area, he learned farming by helping his parents when he was a child. Vitaliano is a dairy cow farmer who produces and sells milk but, at the moment, they have only three dairy cows. Vitaliano and his family live in a small and humble home in Quillacollo, a large suburb of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Vitaliano will purchase another dairy cow to augment his milk production. He hopes to increase his earnings and improve his family's quality of life. Vitaliano would like to construct a new home for his family and hopes that his five younger children will be able to study to become professionals. His oldest daughter could not continue her studies because Vitaliano and his wife lacked the financing necessary to pay for her education at the time, so she only studied through primary school and is

is 47 years old and has been married for 15 years. She and her husband have two children, ages 17 and 15. Nicolasa is a dairy cow farmer. She uses the raw milk to make cheese, and then sells the cheese in the market. She learned dairy cow farming from her mother when she was a little girl.  Nicolasa and her family have a small home in Maica Norte, an area just outside of the city of Cochabamba.  This is where her six dairy cows are located.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nicolasa's husband is working in Spain, so she has been taking care of the business herself. He has been sending his earnings back to the family, so she has been remodeling their home with the extra income. Recently, however, due to the economic crisis, he has not been able to contribute as much. Her oldest child is studying to become an auditor and she is in her second semester of studies.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Nicolasa plans to purchase one more dairy cow. This will help her to increase her level of milk production incrementally.  Nicolasa's dream is for her husband to return from Spain that they can work together in Bolivia and they don't have to be separated anymore.

In the field of goods and services, competition is high and in particular for those members who do not have much merchandise.  They cannot compete with the bigger stores that can lower their costs and still remain competitive.  However, the bank's members have a lot of experience and are motivated by a desire to help their families get ahead.  \r\n\r\nThe loan is to increase merchandise.  For example, to purchase supplies and materials that can help them get better working capital so they can stand up to the competition.

She says that she started her business about 20 years ago but in recent years her production has decreased because she isn't able to find a market in which to put up her products. So she is requesting a small loan to buy wool. In the future she would like to change businesses.

","en":"The \u201cVirgen de Cotoca\u201d Group, represented by Ms. Carolina, is comprised of 12 very dynamic members who wish to participate in activities together to fraternize and become more unified as a group. As they are neighbors, the women have had a friendship for a very long time. They all partake in various commercial and service activities, such as beauty salons, general stores, food sales, and cosmetics. One member has a general store, and when there are concerts in the area, he sells beverages at the venue. Ms. Carolina has her own beverage business, but would like to diversify her products. The majority of group members have stands in front of their homes, and the rest are street vendors. Despite all the adversities that they face, they know how to get ahead because their families depend on it. Concerning competition, we can say that it is high, but when it gets too tough, the group members simply move their stands away from the central market, thus boosting their sales. This loan will be used to restock their shops, purchase work materials and supplies in bulk, and the members who sell cosmetics will take advantage of the ongoing sales. Their greatest hope is to expand their stands to generate greater revenues so that they can offer their children a better future and quality of life. Despite the fact that this is their first loan cycle, the group members already have previous experience working in solidarity groups thanks to financial institutes similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agocapital, to which they are very grateful for their trust and monetary support.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":423330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Skharlem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.94},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2236.4},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2262.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2288.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2341.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.13,"local_amount":2160.94,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2170.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788590,"comment":null},{"amount":312.7,"local_amount":2185.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2195.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788591,"comment":null},{"amount":316.28,"local_amount":2210.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2220.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678760,"comment":null},{"amount":319.93,"local_amount":2236.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678761,"comment":null},{"amount":320.49,"local_amount":2240.32,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2249.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073250,"comment":null},{"amount":661.31,"local_amount":4622.74,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4642.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073251,"comment":null},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":1.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909138,"comment":null},{"amount":334.91,"local_amount":2341.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909139,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T19:52:38Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":150997,"name":"21 De Enero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \"21 D.

They expect to earn better profits, demonstrating the desire to get ahead through honesty, responsibility and work. The group members run different businesses, such as selling bread, provisions, fast food, or cosmetics. They either work from home or as street vendors. Regarding competition, we can mention that their competitors are skilled businesspeople, but the group members have a solid client-base that generates the flow of money that is necessary for daily profits. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise to restock their shops, and purchase goods in bulk, such as sugar and flour. The cosmetic vendors will take advantage of the ongoing sales to make more profits and help support their families and improve their quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":423341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Nela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eldy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26500,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2515.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2544.61},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2573.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2603.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2633.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2663.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2694.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2725.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2756.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2788.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1458.38,"local_amount":10237.66,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10237.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678767,"comment":null},{"amount":375.15,"local_amount":2633.46,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2633.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678768,"comment":null},{"amount":379.46,"local_amount":2663.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2663.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073256,"comment":null},{"amount":383.83,"local_amount":2694.42,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2694.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073257,"comment":null},{"amount":388.24,"local_amount":2725.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2725.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909144,"comment":null},{"amount":392.71,"local_amount":2756.78,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2756.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909145,"comment":null},{"amount":397.23,"local_amount":2788.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2788.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944700,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T22:23:06Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151002,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia is 44 years old and is married to her husband Efrain.

Makawili, Barangay Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She is 49 years old and married to Ramon O., who currently works as a fish vendor in their local community. The couple is blessed with four children who are 16 to 26 years old, with the three younger kids still attending school. Her most cherished aspiration is to provide her children, through her own efforts and hard work, with a good life and a good education that will empower them to have gainful work and a bright future.\r\n\r\nWhen Marjolyn\u2019s children were so much younger, she realized that her husband's income would not be sufficient to sustain the growing needs of their family, especially in relation to her dream of sending her children to college. This is why she decided to go into business for herself by starting a general store.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, when Marjolyn wanted to expand her business, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon. From the loan assistance she received, she was able to enlarge her product offerings and thereby increase her income capacity, which now averages PHP 8,000 net profit. Her increased income enabled her to invest in other businesses as the years went by and now she has a fishing boat that provides additional income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nFor her last loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marjolyn borrowed PHP 15,000 which she used as additional income for both her general store and her fishing business. Now that she has fully repaid that loan within its loan term, she is again applying to renew her loan for the same amount of PHP 15,000 to use as working capital for her two businesses. She hopes to be able to buy some household appliances and have her house repaired with the income she earns from this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":423428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use as

M. is from the village of D'BAN, Calamba, Misamis Occidental. She is 58 years old. Fedila is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Fedila operates a service recycling scrap metal. The main source of income for the business comes from selling scrap metal and other products like bottles and plastic. Fedila has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fedila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fedila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. Fedila is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to buy additional scrap metal for sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Fedila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is 45 years old, and he lives with his wife and son in Hovd province in western Mongolia.  His son, Enhbat, is 11 years old and attends a local secondary school.  He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent.  <p>\r\n\r\nWith his wife's help, G. operates a coal-selling business in his town.  Specifically, he purchases coal directly from local mines, and he transports the purchased coal (by using his large Russian truck) back to his town.  His wife then helps him sell the coal to various local businesses and individuals for use in heating.  G. has operated this business since 2000; by doing so, he has gained a great deal of experience over the years.  He explains that he has a large customer base, including many loyal clients, and that he hopes to purchase a larger truck in the future to keep up with growing demand.  In fact, he notes that his old Russian truck is outdated, and that individuals with newer, larger, more fuel-efficient trucks are able to generate higher earnings than he can, which is why he would like a new truck.  In the meantime, though, G. is simply requesting a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 tugrug (~$725 USD) to make necessary repairs to his truck and to purchase petrol so that he can transport more coal. <p>\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001 and listed its first Kiva loan in January 2009.  It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but it also has mainstream commercial operations.

Bayong, Barangay Balintawak, Escalante City. She is 58 years old and married to Glecerio M. who presently works as a dental technician. Glecerio used to be the sole breadwinner for the family, but in spite of all his hard work, his income was just not enough to cover the expenses, especially the education-related expenses of their five children. Because both Cecilia and Glecerio aspired to a better life for their children, it was their dream to send them all to finish college. \r\n\r\nBecause of her sewing and dressmaking skills, Cecilia started accepting sewing jobs from a few regular customers until, by word of mouth and recommendations, her roster of clients grew. To have more working capital for her growing business, Cecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 and, because of the additional capital infusion, she took the opportunity to open a rice retailing business. Now her combined business income earns her an average monthly profit of PHP 7,000, which has made a big impact on their quality of life.\r\n\r\nToday, Cecilia\u2019s children, who are between 16 and 31 years of age, are well on their way to achieving Cecilia\u2019s and Glecerio's aspirations for them. As her businesses continues to grow, Cecilia uses her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to sustain the capital required to operate them. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 was used to maintain the inventory level of her rice retailing business as well as to purchase sewing supplies. Now on her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to continue sustaining her businesses. She intends to use the income for the education of her children and to save for their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

The main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to customers in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. Gina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional materials for making food. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Gina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate translation by Kiva.

Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents can\u2019t take care of him.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, Hadija has been running a mama lishe (a local restaurant or caf\u00e9). In Tanzania, this usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\n\r\nHadija works at the business for 13 to 16 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. She is requesting a loan of 300,000 Tsh in order to purchase additional ingredients in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another business.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":407544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional ingredients in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151134,"name":"Julfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julfa V. is from the village of Bitibut, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC.

Her son, who is the oldest, is eleven years old and her daughter is just four. Kyyal herself takes care of the house. She keeps two cows and sells milk. In her free time, she also sews traditional national folk art and goods. In this way, even while staying at home, Kyyal is able to not only care for the children and fulfill her duties as housewife, but also to support the family budget. Many years ago, Kyyal became interested in breeding livestock. She has decided to take action and to try it. She wasn\u2019t afraid to invest 18,000 <em>soms<\/em> (420 USD) of her own money toward the purchase of cows. Meanwhile, she and her husband were able to save up enough money for the purchase of a home. From the sale of milk and her folk creations, Kyyal currently earns 3,500 <em>soms<\/em> (82 USD) per month. That equals to her average monthly income. Now Kyaal would like to receive a loan to buy two calves for further breeding and for sale on the market. Kyaal would also like to build a large house on the income from her milk and folk goods sales, since construction requires the investment of a large sum of money all at once.\r\n<p>\r\nHere are Kyaal\u2019s partners in the group: Miralan, Elmira, and Gulzat.\r\n<p>\r\nMiralan is twenty-two. He is already married and has a daughter. Miralan resells cattle on the livestock market. His wife stays at home, as their daughter is just one and a half years old. Miralan is a very capable businessman and provides sufficiently for his family. He hopes to receive a loan and to invest it towards his working capital. Miralan\u2019s lifelong dream is to save up enough money to buy a private apartment.\r\n<p>\r\nElmira is thirty-one years old. She is the mother of two children. Her youngest daughter is just three years old. Elmira works as a saleslady in the \u201cNational\u201d shopping center. Her husband is a metalworker in the town of Tokmok. Thanks to a joint effort, Elmira and her husband were able to do a good job renovating their home. Elmira decided to apply for a loan in order to obtain a large cow. After reselling the cow, Elmira plans to buy a car.\r\n<p>\r\nGulzat is thirty-three yars old. She is married and has two children. Gulzat works as a salesperson and consultant. Her husband is the founder of the firm \u201cAsia Build.\u201d Gulzat hopes to receive a loan and put it towards the trade of consumer goods. With the profits, Gulzat wants to buy herself a car.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anastasia Uglova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":423790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of livestock in order to finance various goals, such as building a home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmak","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-11-20T17:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kyyal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miralan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":14107},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":14587},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":15319},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":351.06},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":323.29,"local_amount":14107,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":14134.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838991,"comment":null},{"amount":334.28,"local_amount":14587,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":14614.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730779,"comment":null},{"amount":351.06,"local_amount":15319,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15348.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121326,"comment":null},{"amount":366.37,"local_amount":15987,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16017.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T11:46:43Z","paid_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151252,"name":"Stella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella is married with 5 children and she is 38 years old.
