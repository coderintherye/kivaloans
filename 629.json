Alongside her siblings and parents, she would spend 12 hours a day creating beautiful handmade clothing and jewelry and selling it at markets.  When she moved to San Francisco in 1985, she had to put her artisanal talents temporarily on hold as she cleaned homes to make a living. However, after she gave birth to her daughter in 1993, her commitment to family and her love for handicrafts led her to resume selling artisanal crafts.   \r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I gave birth to my daughter, I realized how important it was to be able to spend more time with her. I needed a job that would allow me to take care of my child.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs she had once done in Ecuador, Rosa began selling her clothing and jewelry in the streets of the Mission, a San Francisco neighborhood\u2014but this time she is able to earn a living through the arts while working significantly fewer hours than she did as a child or in her career cleaning houses. \r\n\r\n\u201cI work extremely hard. Owning my own shop gives me the freedom to create my own schedule and spend time with family, as well\u201d, Rosa noted. \r\n\r\nWord of Rosa\u2019s beautiful jewelry has spread over the years and her business has grown so much that she was able to open up a storefront right in the Mission, named Native Hand by Hand and Silver Fashions. But in 2009, when she wanted a loan in order to expand her business, she was considered \u201cunbankable\u201d by major banks because she did not have any credit history. After a friend referred her to Opportunity Fund, she used a microloan to buy more inventory. She was able to pay back her loan and increase her credit score to 727. Now she has established her credit history and become more integrated into the U.S. financial system.\r\n\r\nRosa wants to expand her business even more in order to pay for her daughter\u2019s college and she needs a loan for $1,500 to purchase additional inventory for her store.  \u201cI am so proud of my daughter for having graduated from high school this spring,\u201d she said. But along with this joy comes the necessity of providing for further education. This second microloan will aid her in supporting her family and following her dreams by continuing to grow her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1037.12,"image":{"id":808961,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2406,"youtube_id":"mEhULwaOPCE"},"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional inventory for her store, such as jewelry and handmade crafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Francisco, CA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":139.14},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":147.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":149.07},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":150.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":151.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":152.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":154.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":155.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.14},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":139.14,"local_amount":139.14,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":139.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105076,"comment":null},{"amount":147.05,"local_amount":147.05,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":147.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866409,"comment":null},{"amount":148.32,"local_amount":148.32,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":148.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682481,"comment":null},{"amount":149.07,"local_amount":149.07,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":149.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637968,"comment":null},{"amount":150.29,"local_amount":150.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854387,"comment":null},{"amount":151.11,"local_amount":151.11,"processed_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":151.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264163,"comment":null},{"amount":152.14,"local_amount":152.14,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T08:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":152.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T04:59:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315084,"name":"Larch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Larch is a housewife.

So Mrs. Cheap would like to take out a loan in order to purchase a used motorbike for their traveling needs; it can save money spent on motor taxi service. She hopes to use the remainder of the cash to pay for plowing and harvest costs.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Lorena earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from the variety store, she has a bakeshop where she sells different kinds of bread and pastries. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 605 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue business operations, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She\u2019ll also invest a portion of the loan to buy ingredients to be used in the bakeshop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorena hopes to be able to expand soon.

This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents, like Sarah, as she herself has been an undergraduate, and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSarah operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to partake of the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, Sarah is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSarah dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Farming has extricated him out of his adversity, and for that reason he devotes most of his time planning how his business can gain stronger ground. \r\n\r\nThe fact that coffee sells highly on the markets in western Uganda has been giving him further motivation to work hard at establishing a bigger niche. Proceeds from his coffee sales have been used to purchase high grade manure for his farms. Weekly his coffee sales profits total 450,000 Ugandan shillings (~$180), quite a substantial amount of money by Ugandan standards. \r\n\r\nJosephat says with this Kiva loan, he will be empowered to purchase more high grade manure for his coffee farms.

Elle s'approvisionne \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur dans un pays limitrophe et revend ses produits dans sa localit\u00e9. Son activit\u00e9 lui permet de prendre en charge ses besoins alimentaires, de sant\u00e9, vestimentaires ainsi que ceux de son enfant. Elle n'a jamais sollicit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l'IMCEC. Le montant de 100 000F qu'elle sollicite en ce moment lui permettra d'acheter 2 cartons de parfum, 2 cartons de cr\u00e8me, 1 basin de 30m, 2 tissu maylouss. Ces achats vont renforcer son stock et lui permettre d'accroitre ses b\u00e9n\u00e9fices. Avec ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, elle pourra vivre dans de meilleurs conditions, elle et son enfant.   ","en":"The borrower is a young woman, 36 years of age. She is divorced and lives with one child. She had started training in sewing but stopped it since she could not pay her tuition. She then involved herself in the retail of clothing and cosmetics.\r\nShe gets her supplies from a neighboring country, and resells these items in her town. Her activity allows her to support herself and her child for their food, healthcare and clothing needs. She never requested a loan from IMCEC before. The 100,000 XOF amount she is now requesting will make it possible for her to purchase two boxes of perfumes, two boxes of lotion, 30 meters of brocade cloth and two \"maylouss\" garments.\r\nThese purchases will strengthen her stock and allow her to increase her profits. With these, she and her child will be able to live in better

Peter's reputation for hard work is well known and he has become a by-word for it.  Because he has been such a stickler for hard work, he now is looked upon as role model in his village in Bushenyi in Western Uganda. \r\n\r\nPeter enjoys every experience that relates to running his food sales business.  He sells food such as pineapples, bananas, cassava, maize and beans. He says the last 20 years have been worthwhile in every sense of the word.  As to whether he anticipates more success.  He says all bets are off.  He says by every long shot he has to establish a much bigger niche in the food markets in and around Bushenyi and the rest of Western Uganda. \r\n\r\nA business that he started small has blossomed into one he has banked on to provide better welfare to his family and relatives.  This is something he is so proud of.  As a result, his confidence has been in ascendancy for quite a long haul of time.  What really comes in handy is that Peter has his own farm where he grows crops such as bananas, beans, cassava, maize, sweet potatoes, pineapples, fruits and vegetables, etc.  He plans on putting up his own maize grinding mill in the near future. \r\n\r\nWeekly, Peter says this business generates him shillings 30,000 in sales profits.  With this kiva loan, Peter says he is going to purchase more bean and maize seeds for planting and also high grade manure to improve the yields of his farms.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":809460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more bean and maize seeds for planting and to also get high grade manure to improve the yields of his farms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-12T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilgori","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stanley","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Federesia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Medard","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Provia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Naome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sowedi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoram","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6550000,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1091666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1091666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1091666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1091666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1091666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1091666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":414.41,"local_amount":1074997,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1075386.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022793,"comment":null},{"amount":6.43,"local_amount":16667,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16673.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248968,"comment":null},{"amount":1262.49,"local_amount":3275002.68,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3276190.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868538,"comment":null},{"amount":420.84,"local_amount":1091668.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1092064.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648373,"comment":null},{"amount":420.83,"local_amount":1091665,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1092060.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313737,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T14:40:59Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315277,"name":"Alicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alicia is 37 years old and has a fish selling business.

Her biggest obstacles are the weather and, when she is unable to find a ride, having to walk long distances.\n\nWith the support of this loan she will buy seasonings such as annatto, spices, cinnamon, cloves, rosemary, linseed, as well as little bags and staples for packaging. She will be able to supply her business with the support of this loan and she hopes her sales increase. Her goal is to continue supporting her children so that they will graduate.

They work day in, day out to improve the home, and have done so bit by bit through loans from this institution. They are very grateful for the help that has been offered to them to speed up the changes that they have made to their home. These improvements have allowed them to offer their children better comfort, as their home is now more peaceful. One of Mr Gustavo's priorities is to install floor tiles in one of the rooms that he is expanding. This will make it more clean and orderly, and prevent damage to his children's health from the dirt floor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":284.95,"image":{"id":810248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

D. L. Llave there is a small community called El Para\u00edso that\u2019s located along the Cordoba-VeraC. highway.

Julissa has three children but only the youngest, Pablo, 12, is still dependent on her.  He goes to the local elementary school.\r\n\r\nJulissa tells us that she\u2019s always been a very hard working woman.  When she left school her mother taught her to work doing domestic chores and to prepare Mexican fast food like \u201cchiles rellenos\u201d (stuffed chili peppers) and tamales which has been very useful for her because since she got married she has been selling food on weekends to earn a little extra money to help her husband with household expenses.  She sells her snacks among friends and neighbors in the community.  First, she makes the tamales and the chiles and when they are ready she places them in buckets and goes out door to door selling them.  Thanks to God, she always sells out everything.  Besides selling fast food snacks, Julissa also sells beef and pork on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  She needs this loan to buy meat, chilies, eggs, tomatoes, onion, corn, firewood, banana leaves, oil and plastic bags.  She tells us that sales have helped her a lot because bit by bit she\u2019s helped her husband build a house out of substantial materials and she hopes to use her profits to continue with the construction because she wants to have something to leave her children and that they not want for anything.\r\n\r\nThe other ten members are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda \u2013 grocery sales\r\n\r\nAlejandro-

Khetam took out a loan from FATEN to purchase living room furniture that they couldn't purchase when she got married. She was using plastic chairs instead. Now that she learned about FATEN, she took out the loan to pay for the furniture and pay the loan back on a daily basis. Khetam is a conservative woman. Therefore, her husband is photographed instead in FATEN's Branch office."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.7,"image":{"id":810462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase new home furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":"Jabalia-Gaza Strip","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2011-07-13T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khetam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":72.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79.18},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":80.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":86.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":90.19},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":95.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":97.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.82,"local_amount":70.82,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":70.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227112751,"comment":null},{"amount":72.15,"local_amount":72.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":72.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232874243,"comment":null},{"amount":73.5,"local_amount":73.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238690471,"comment":null},{"amount":74.88,"local_amount":74.88,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":74.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244646698,"comment":null},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":76.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":76.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250863730,"comment":null},{"amount":189.06,"local_amount":189.06,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-22T08:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":189.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264623136,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-08T22:40:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":315449,"name":"Hasan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasan is a young man from Deir Al Balah in Gaza Strip.
