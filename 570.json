It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and their children in Kamalen Sirakoro, an outlying district of Sikasso City. Kadidiatou has been running this business buying and selling firewood for about three years. She enjoys a great reputation in this business and receives many orders, especially during the off-season. \r\n\r\nBut her resources cannot allow her to meet the demand. Thus, about a year ago, she decided to collaborate with the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She is now requesting this initial loan enabling her to increase her business capital for buying 5 cart loads of firewood from towns surrounding Sikasso City.

Her story is representative of both her group and of Esperanza's Haitian (many of whom have recently immigrated to the Dominican Republic) and Dominican clients. The group is based in Los Alcarrizos, a dusty industrial town north of Santo Domingo, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Here she makes her home in a simple structure with her husband and three children.\r\n\r\nEvelis has come to Esperanza with the goal of growing her business but, also, because it is a way of development for the community. She is not only interested in the money; she cares about the community. She operates a business where she sells household and beauty products. She is associated to a franchise. She sells those products and motivates others to join and go forward. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she intends to increase her inventory. She believes that this will allow her to supply more clients (other businesses, households and salons) and to distinguish herself by always having what is needed in stock, while providing high quality products. She will use the profits to save and to address some needs in her family. In the long term she would like to continue growing her business with Esperanza to the point where she can sell more products, reach more clients, motivate others and eventually have enough profits to purchase her own home and to continuing helping her children. She especially wants to pay for their studies. Thank you so much for your support!

Rubida has spent the greatest part of her life in the small community of Puerto Ipoki, where from a very young age she was trained in the family activity, and for this reason she now engages in growing plantain, cocoa and coffee, a job that has provided her with the income she needs to support herself. She sells all of her crops in the market of the town of Merced, because it\u2019s there where she gets the best prices for her products. The part of her job she enjoys the most is sowing her lands, something she does with very carefully. She has been engaging in this activity for 3 years, and she thinks the most difficult task is to transport her products to the market, being as it is that there are few transportation means in her area. In time she wishes to buy more farmlands, in order to increase her production. This is the third loan she has requested to MFP: she has been very punctual with her loans and she hopes to do the same now. She is a very active member of her communal banks, and she is really loved by the rest of her teammates.

She is a cheerful and hard-working woman who lives in a rental house together with her two beloved children who she would like to provide with a good education.\r\n\r\nCarmen sells beauty products and visits her customers in their homes.  She is a very persistent and persuasive saleswoman which means that she finishes her cosmetics sales quickly.  She is very well known in the city of Tarma and people know that the products she sells are very good quality.  What Carmen most enjoys about her work is advising her customers about what will work best with their skin.  She has been in this business for 4 years and considers the most difficult part of her work to be collecting payment for her products since her customers don't always have the money to pay her.  However, she always works things out so that they pay for their purchases in full.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Carmen hopes to set up a cosmetics store where she can make her sales more comfortably, without having to go from door to door.  This is her tenth loan with MFP.  She would like to grow her business which is why she will make all her repayments on time, so that she can access another loan in the future.  She also knows that she has the support of her community bank.  Carmen will spend the 2,000 Peruvian soles that she has requested to buy more cosmetics since she has had a lot of demand for them lately."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":739336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She lives in her own home together with her husband Florentino, 49, and their two beloved children, whom they want to give a good education. Carmen's grocery store is one of the most visited in the city of Tarma.  She opens very early in the morning, waiting for the customers to come buy what they need. She is a very attentive and happy saleswoman; she always greets her customers with a smile and is always ready to help them with their purchases. What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers.  She has been in this business for 4 years and thinks the hardest part is having to be open all day long without being able to leave.  In the future, she hopes to be able to increase the size of the store and add more merchandise, so that she can offer her customers a better variety of products.

Paulina began to sell things when she was very young, originally in order to support her partner. Later, over time, this person looked for another place to live, but this was not an obstacle for her, because selling soda, cakes, pacifiers, and clothing very much helped her support her family with their expenses. Later she improved her capital, which she then invested in a supply of fruit on her little tricycle that was given to her, and she offered it in the area where she lives, although many times she had to travel to make her sales. Sadly, she got sick a little later and had to give up this business and start over with a different one. This time she bought a small supply of soda, detergents, milk, and rice in a small space where she lives. Very diligent and hardworking, she put up her kiosk in a corner of her house. She also works as a housekeeper in addition to washing clothes. Providing school education to her five children has been one of her goals and she hopes to reach it when her last child finishes high school. She will invest this loan in groceries such as sugar, milk, noodles, rice, and soda because that is what she needs.\r\nHaving her own house is her greatest dream as well as setting up a small, well-stocked store, given that she has been the guardian of a house for years. She is happy for the support provided by the Kiva loans to small people such as herself who really want to get ahead.

He lives with his family in the urban city of Picsi, a small but growing community. For more than five years, Juan has worked as a bricklayer. Given the decreased demand for bricklayers in the current market, he needs to generate additional income. So he is starting a business providing passenger transport services to members of his community and surrounding towns. To do so, he will convert his motorcycle into a mototaxi, by placing a cabin on the back in which he can transport passengers.

","en":"Daycis, 36, was born in Rio Abajo, a district located in Pueblo Nuevo in the municipality of Esteli.  She is married and has 3 children aged 16, 12 and 2 years, who are in school.  She has had a business selling chicken for 5 years.  Her husband helps her with the business.  She started with some help from her sister, who lent her money so that she could start this business.  The first thing that she bought was a refrigerator.  Later she bought 100 pounds of chicken.   At the time she was 29.  She goes to sell in Pueblo Nuevo where she travels 3 kilometers each day by bicycle so that she can arrive early to sell her products; the trip takes 20 minutes.  Her husband helps out in the house and he also works in a chicken restaurant.  She would like to be able to sell her products in the municipal market where she could have her own stand.  She will use this loan to purchase 750 pounds of chicken.  This will help her to acquire her products at a better price since she will be paying on a cash basis, helping her to increase her sales and get more customers.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nFlorida is married and has three school-aged children. Florida owns and operates a livestock business. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Florida has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Florida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Florida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Florida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase hog feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Florida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 49 years old. Erlinda is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has 10 school-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nErlinda is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase hog feed and other supplies. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is married and has three children, aged 12, 5 and 3. In 2000, she established her business of making brass religious statues. Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy raw materials for her business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Gyan Devi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts. Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  \r\n\r\nIn Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is Virginia D. G.'s group.\r\n\r\nVirginia is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Virginia raises pigs for fattening and sale. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Virginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan taken out by Virginia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Bantuanon, Lantapan, Bukidnon. She is 41 years old, married, and has four adult children. To make a living, Darely owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling canned goods,snack foods, shampoo, soap, and biscuits in the local community. Darely has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Darely joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Darely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Darely is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods and snack foods. This loan will be Darely's second loan  from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Poblacion, Lantapan, Bukidnon. She is 45 years old. Imelda is married and has 12 school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, junk foods, detergents, shampoo, soap and biscuits in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Imelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, junk foods & instant noodles. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Imelda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Almoudou is more than 45 years old, he is married and has four daughters. He lives with his family in Medina, one of the neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of Mali). Not having had the chance to get ahead in school, he started over by sewing with his uncle in Sikasso over thirty years ago. His workshop is located in the large market of Sikasso and most of its clients are mostly male salesmen.\r\n\r\nWith such strong experience, he has the complete confidence of the tailors' association and this earned him the chairmanship of the Supervisory Committee of the Association of Tailors Sikasso (TTY). In addition to sewing, he purchases sewing machines in Lome (Togo Republic) and fabric for mens' clothes in order to resell them to the other tailors in Sikasso.\r\n\r\nIn order to better meet his increasingly growing orders, he is requesting his fourth loan from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He has been partnering with Soro Yiriwaso for about three years. This fourth loan will enable him to purchase 20 sewing machines, accessories and 12 sets of fabric. With this loan, he expects to earn a monthly profit of 300 000 FCFA. With these profits, he intends to pay for all essential personal expenses, contribute to family expenses, pay interest on the loan and invest the rest in his

After exercising his profession for twenty years in the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, he returned home seven years ago and began a small retail business buying and selling cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, soap, and recently selling pre-paid mobile phone cards and telephone cards, and recharging batteries.\r\n\r\nIn his neighbourhood, he is also the local representative of the National Society of Tobacco and Matches of Mali (SONATAM SA). He is quite sought after for the quality and diversity of his products. Over three years ago he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso MFI to satisfy his ever-increasing number of customers. He is now requesting his fourth personal loan, all preceding loans having been correctly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith his new loan he intends to buy 15 cartons of various cigarettes, 5 bags of sugar, 8 packages of candy, 2 cartons of tea, 6 packages of chewing-gum, 7 packages of matches, 2 cartons of soap, 5 additional battery chargers, 40 Orange\/Malitel telephone recharge cards, etc.\r\n\r\nHe buys his products from local wholesalers before reselling them retail, for cash or credit, to a customer base of garage owners and truck drivers, as his stall is located close by car garages and the regional offices of the Sikasso Customs.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he hopes to attain a monthly income of 230,000 FCFA which will mainly be used to increase his working stock, pay loan interests and invest the remainder in his business

He is married and the father of five children, and he resides with his wife and their children in a large traditional extended family in the Bougoula Ville district, the downtown of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  He became familiar with woodworking at a young age from his father, who was a well-known master craftsman. He is much in demand by the people of Sikasso. \r\n\r\nWith major experience in his domain, Diakalia receives many orders, but the means he has at his disposal are insufficient to satisfy further all these needs, which are increasing continuously. So he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about three years ago and is now on his third individual loan. This new loan will be used to buy one and a half 10-tonne truck loads of rafters and planks and a half load of plywood.\r\n\r\nHe buys his lumber in surrounding towns (Tinkr\u00e9la, Denderso, Lobougoula, etc.) and then cuts them up and brings them to Sikasso for making furnishings, benches, tables, desks, and chairs for resale.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Diakalia envisions making a monthly profit of 300,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially for increasing his business capital for expenses, to help with family expenses, and to cover the loan interest. The rest will be invested in his business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":806.25,"image":{"id":740689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy lumber","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581056,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881992,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T07:18:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":286016,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia M., age 39, earns a living by buying and selling clothing, plastic boots, plastic plates, and bed sheets in her local community.

D. is 59, married and has five grown children. For a long time, he worked as a driver in the local area but after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, he started his own business in cattle breeding and land cultivation. With starting capital of 5,000 KGS, he managed to develop a farm with eight cows and bulls earning a monthly profit of 5,000 KGS.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.
