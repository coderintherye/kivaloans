He preaches the word of God and although he does not live with his family, he feels fortunate to live at the church they attend along with their friends. The church is located in the town of Sangani, in the central Peruvian rainforest zone. Pedro earns a living selling natural medicines as well as stainless steel cookware. However, his third job, which he is most passionate about, is grafting plants. He does this with the help of an assistant. The main plants he grafts are cocoa beans, citrus fruits, and mangos. What he likes most about this job is seeing the seeds grow into trees. According to Pedro, there are very few people who work in grafting, yet there is a large demand since the majority of farmers seek out grafts for their farms. The main setback for Pedro is working capital since he needs an average of 10,000 soles for the process. He belongs to the \"Gedeon de los Olivos\" Communal Bank. This is his fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, through which he feels he can find the support he so badly needs to be able to continue his work. Pedro is preparing for the cocoa bean planting season, and for this reason he is planning to buy cocoa beans with the loan he is requesting, which he will place is large black bags for making the grafts.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":728039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cocoa beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-12T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621050,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T21:21:00Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280102,"name":"Primavera Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 Primavera es de la zona de Pa'i \u00d1u de San Lorenzo.

Her business is handicrafts.  Raquel is a craftswoman and her grandmother and her mother also work in this field.\r\n\r\nRaquel started out weaving by hand, making representations of landscapes.  Andean iconography is very well known in this area, as it is throughout the Peruvian Andes.  Raquel is familiar with these landscapes and she captures the experiences of her community within them.\r\n\r\nRaquel used to weave small bracelets with thin strands of sheep's wool.  She would take this wool from her animals and spin it on specially made sticks, to form skeins, then dye different sections with natural oxides, using a boiling process.  She started making these bracelets in different colors, with different motifs, and would take them to sell in tourist areas.  She has been doing this since she was a very young girl.\r\n\r\nGradually, Raquel's village was brought to life and became known as one of the craft villages.  Raquel got together with other weavers, craftswomen, painters and artists at the Sunday craft fair.  Years ago, she would visit these fairs only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.

Her business is raising animals and farming.  She has been doing this since she was a child.  Eduarda receives help from her children.  They are grown up and come to support her in her work every planting and harvest season.  This has helped her to improve her situation and get ahead since this work is often very hard and requires her to hire machinery such as a tractor or a yoke of oxen which are essential in order to optimize her time.\r\n\r\nEduarda sells her harvested crops wholesale in the central market of the city nearest her town.  Over recent years she has recovered what she has invested but her greatest wish is to make more formal inroads into selling her crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Eduarda's eighth loan from MFP and she has always enjoyed being a member of her community bank which she joined because of the solidarity between all of its members.

She is married to Severino, age 44, and they have nine children.  They have their own home located along Tupac Amaru Avenue in the District of Kimbiri.  Astria and her husband are the breadwinners of their family.  When Astria was a young girl, her parents taught her how to work on a farm.  She is now a farmer and has five hectares of land on which she plants coffee and pineapples, tropical fruits grown in the Apurimac River Valley.  Astria has worked on her land for 22 years, and during the harvest season she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  She considers the most difficult part of her job to be transporting her products from the farm to the distribution centers in the city of San Francisco, the place that offers the best prices for grain and pineapples.  Her difficulty is when she lacks sufficient income to pay her workers in advance since they provide assistance during the harvest.  For this reason, she has taken out loans with institutions such as MFP.

He is married to Domitilia, who is 48, and he has 6 children.  The family has their own home which is located in the community of Vista Alegre Alta, an annex of the Kimbiri district. Feliciano is the one who supports his family.  From the time that he was very young his parents taught him to work on the farm.  He is a farmer who has 5 hectares of land where he cultivates coffee plants and pineapple, fruits that grow in this forest area near the Rio Apurimac Valley.  He has been farming his own lands for 25 years, and during harvest times he has the support of his children and he also hires workers so that he can extract his fruit more rapidly.  What he likes most about his work is harvesting the fruit of the plants, because in this way he feels that his months of hard work are being rewarded with quality fruit.  What he considers most difficult is transporting his products from the farm to the collection centers that are located in the city of San Francisco, a place where the best prices are offered for his coffee beans and pineapples.  The difficulty he faces is that he does not have enough money to cover all of the advance payments that he must make to the workers who help him with the harvest.  For this reason, he has come to the MFP institution to request a loan.  But now his priority is to cultivate more pineapple plants since he has 1 hectare of land that is not cultivated.  This is his 7th loan with MFP, and he feels that this support will help him a lot to make progress with his work.  In his communal bank he is a member who is very well-liked by his fellow group members, since he is very supportive of them.  With the 1,000 Peruvian soles requested he will pay for workers so that they can assist him in harvesting his coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":728270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers to help him with his coffee harvest.

Now with the savings he has accumulated he was been able to make those dreams of owning his own parcel of land a reality. He knows the hard labor of farm work well having done this work for 20 years. During harvest time he hires temporary workers to transport his prodcuts to different markets. He is very dedicated to his job because thanks to his every day labors he is able to see his plants bear fruit. He asserts that he does not like the winter because during these months the insects are abundant and this negatively affects his crop yields. The loan that he is applying for will be used to buy a cargo motorcycle to quickly deliver his products to the markets. With time he hopes to buy more land and vary his crops more thus providing economic stability for his family. This will be his sixth loan with MFP, and he has been very punctual with the payments from his previous loans and plans to continue this practice. At his community bank he is well liked by the other members. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":728320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To purchase a motorcycle to transport his produce to the market.

The group consists of eight women who know each other and are neighbors.  They are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSra. Marcela C. V. will use her loan to buy thread and napkins to embroider and sell.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Beda V\u00e1zquez C. will buy thread, ribbons, and gift items to restock her sewing supply shop.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Ambrosia Mel\u00e9ndez Z. will buy soap, eggs, milk, sugar, and other products to stock her store.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Yolanda Mil\u00e1n R. will buy all types of candy to sell.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Alicia V\u00e1zquez Campose will buy cornmeal, cheese, cream, vegetables, and other items for preparing and selling her dishes.  \r\n\u2022\tSra. Yadira C. Mil\u00e1n will buy dyes and scissors for her beauty salon.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Mar\u00eda Luisa C. R\u00edos will buy rice, vegetables, and meats for selling food in her establishment.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Cira P. S\u00e1nchez will buy trousers, skirts, and other items to restock her business.\r\n\r\nSra. Yadira C. Mil\u00e1n is a member of this group.  She is 21 years old and obtained her diploma after completing three years of high school.  Yadira is married, pregnant, and will be having her first child very soon.  She has a beauty parlor as well as a business selling food.  The loan she is requesting will be used for both businesses.  She plans to buy liquid foundation, dyes, manicure supplies, soft drinks, meats, vegetables, condiments, and gas.  Since she is pregnant, Yadira has chosen not to work in her beauty salon at the moment because of the chemical fumes that could harm her baby.  She currently offers quick breads, snacks, sandwiches, stews, stuffed corn cakes, and soft drinks.  Her mother-in-law started this business ten years ago and left it to her so that she could vacation in the United States.  When she began working with her mother-in-law, Yadira learned how to prepare the food.  Her business is located on the outskirts of Jaloxtoc.  She lives in the central part of town, so she must take public transportation in order to get to her business.  The business is important and special to Yadira because it keeps her busy and enables her to support herself.  Her favorite part of the business is making the tortillas, the quick breads, and the snacks.  She is proud of seeing her customers enjoy the food for its flavor as well as the tortillas.  Her customers include neighbors, teachers, students, and out-of-town visitors.  The business is popular since her mother-in-law knows many people.  The challenges to her business are the dusty climate, the high cost of electricity, and competition from similar businesses.  Her business profits are reinvested in vegetables and meats.  \r\n\r\nSra. Yadira is planning to expand her business by introducing candies and pork.  She believes she will be able to save up enough money to buy the candy.  Her business has helped improve her family\u2019s quality of life and prevented them from lacking anything.  What she wants most is to build a house and have a space all to herself since she currently lives with her mother-in-law.  Her hopes and plans include expanding her business, moving forward, and improving her home.  Yadira is happy with this loan since it has given her the opportunity to invest in her business and continue growing.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cWe are grateful for the opportunity given to us to move forward in our businesses and hope to continue having your support.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":723231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase liquid foundation, dyes, manicure supplies, soft drinks, meats, vegetables, condiments, and gas.

Four women are its members; they all know each other and are neighbors.  They are:  Mrs. Lorenza E. C. who will use the loan to buy rice by the kilogram, eggs, pork, sausages, vegetables, cream, cheese and corn to prepare her meals; Mrs. Marlen Catalina V. V\u00e1zquez who will buy women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes on order and to have stock available to offer her customers; Mrs. Agustina C. R. who will buy merchandise like cloth napkins and tablecloths and thread, needles, buttons, elastic, clasps, hooks, etc.; to stock her business, Mrs. Melba Garc\u00eda Q. will buy blouses, skirts, pants, sweaters and men\u2019s clothes like pants and shirts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Agustina C. R. is a group member.  She\u2019s 57 years old and finished sixth grade of elementary school.  She\u2019s married and her husband\u2019s a farmer; they have six children:  Porfirio, 42, Ezequiel, 40, Jes\u00fas, 38, H\u00e9ctor, 35, Germ\u00e1n, 32 and Luis, 30.  All the children are married and work.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling notions, toys and women\u2019s articles like perfume, cosmetics and accessories.  She requested her loan to buy merchandise.  She will buy thread, needles, yarn, hoops, napkins and tablecloths to embroider and toys.  Her usual customers are young girls and women.  She offers them notions like napkins to embroider, thread, yarn, embroidery hoops, cosmetics, perfumes, toys and accessories for young girls and young ladies like hairpins, brackets, pendants, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business 20 years ago needing to support her children.  She taught herself how to go to Mexico City on her own to get her merchandise.  She started out with just a few items.  She wouldn\u2019t spend anything but rather would reinvest all her profits back into the business.  She gradually grew and now she earns profits.\r\n\r\nShe went to work in the United States for two and a half years and saved up.  When she returned she built her business\u2019 booth so now is able to leave her merchandise there because before she had to take it back and forth from home.  She was also able to vary her merchandise and her business grew still more.  The space where she has her booth is borrowed and is in the town of Moyotepec a block and a half from home; she can walk to it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her survive, it helps her fill her time and it amuses her while helping her.  When she\u2019s at work she is also working making felt arrangements that a friend is teaching her how to make.  She is proud of her business.  Thanks to God and the effort she\u2019s put into it she is proud to have this kind of business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps her take care of customers and to set up the booth.  Her business is popular because of its location in the market and several people come by to buy.  The challenges she faces are the high costs because if the price of her products rises she has to raise her prices too.  Her business faces competition from another similar one in the market.\r\n\r\nShe uses profits from the business to cover needs like gas, light and sometimes the telephone and to reinvest.  What she likes are the profits; she has a separate investment already.\r\n\r\nAgustina is very happy with this loan because it allows her to stock her business, to become fulfilled and to enlarge it so that it will look prettier.  This business has helped her economically quite a bit.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019d like to make some home improvements like enlarge some of the bedrooms so that when her children visit with their families they\u2019ll have somewhere to stay.  Her plans and hopes are to continue progressing in her business and continue to save for when she is unable to work any longer.  Her children are adult and take care of their own households.\r\n\r\nThe group members want to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad:  \u201cThanks for the support you give us.  We feel good because you are interested in our businesses and, above all, that women better themselves.  You help us a lot with the low interest rates you offer, by charging less interest.  Thank you very much for the support which will be of great help to us.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":718406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy merchandise like thread, needles, yarn and embroidery hoops to embroider napkins and tablecloths and to buy toys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlen Catalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melba Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":346.88,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4166.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292490,"comment":null},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2777.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160748,"comment":null},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2777.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233622,"comment":null},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T12:03:09Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":280226,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felicia, de 42 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia al lado de sus dos hijos menores; juntos se esfuerzan a diario por salir adelante.

is 24 years old, single, and a resident of Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya.

His mixed farm produces tea, which he sells through Kenya Tea Development Authority and beans, onions and milk, which are sold to the local market. He also relies on his pension pay to cater to the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 45,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

He is requesting a loan of 7000 Philippine pesos (PHP) that will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be Reychard's first loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling seafood, including fish such as sardines and mackerel, in the local community. Felipa has been engaged in her business for more than 6 years and earns approximately 5000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Felipa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to purchase fish and as working capital for her business.\r\n\r\nFelipa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase fish, such as milk fish and sardines, for sale. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and\/or expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHagdan sa Pag-uswag Foundation, Inc.

She does this work to share the financial burden with her husband. She has no child yet; that\u2019s why she spends her spare time doing her household responsibilities. Her brother and sister also live with her and contribute financially by doing work. Both of them are also involved in the same business. Bashiran has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her brother who wants to expand his utensils-selling business. With the loan, he will buy utensils of steel and plastic that will allow him to sell in larger quantity and make more profits. He has been operating this business for the past 10 years and Bashiran is confident that a loan investment will bring more profits to him and will expand his business. She is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as used clothing. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Leonora from HSPFI.

Her name is Marleny, and she is 35 years old and married with four children (11, 5, 3, and 1 1\/2 years old).\r\n\r\nMarleny is a professional artisan who inherited her skills from her ancestors.  She is originally from the town of Chinchero.  From the time she was very young, she was involved with artisanal crafts without knowing that they were an art form; she made them part of her daily life.  She learned to spin and to tint the various wools with natural dyes from the higher areas of the Andes.  With great facility she learned to knit by hand using rustic knitting implements.  She wove using wool to create different designs.  Generally, the patterns are symbolic representations of Andean daily life: the landscapes, the animals, planting and harvesting, the sun and the water.\r\n\r\nMarleny grew up surrounded by all these things and with her father Forferio painting scenes of nature all the while.  The paintings were discovered and helped to establish a history of a town full of beautiful landscapes and that for centuries has preserved the purity of the Inca legacy through its customs and particularly its art.\r\n\r\nMarleny has been featured in international documentaries and continues to contribute fine artwork to her town and to the world.  Today she exports pieces to the United States.
