In the recent 2011 season, Neddy had an excellent maize yield harvesting 10 bags on 1\/2 an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Neddy was only able to harvest two bags of maize on 1\/2 acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Neddy and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Neddy will educate her children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wesakulila B group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize. \r\n\r\nNeddy is pictured with her group members in the photograph as shown.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":927541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T07:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jescah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":74900,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-26T13:35:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362246,"name":"Gloria Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe GLORIA est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans la m\u00eame zone.

But Nazca is also known for its hard-working people, who have preserved their culture despite frequent earthquakes, tsunamis and a high level of poverty in the region.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.42,"image":{"id":927554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise (blouses, shirts, trousers, etc.).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:04:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta Yovanny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":102.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":106.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":131.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":136.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":142.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":148.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":100.14,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":103.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250735426,"comment":null},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":102.26,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":105.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142474,"comment":null},{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":106.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":110.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271066,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T18:48:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362254,"name":"Santos Erodita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Santos tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo, dos hijos y una nieta.\n\nElla junto con su familia tiene m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os de trabajar en la agricultura, sembrando ma\u00edz y fr\u00edjol, de esa forma ella brinda el estudio a sus hijos.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Santos solicita el pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, para comprar una camionada de arena y 20 bolsas de cemento, para cementar el piso de su casa ya que en invierno se moja por que es de tierra.

She is also very cheerful and sociable.  She is married to Jairo and the couple have five children who are now adults and have their own families.  They no longer live with Juana but visit her very often.  \r\n\r\nJuana's business is selling groceries and soda.  She opened a grocery store and small diner in her home where she serves her customers.  She started out with her own capital and some loans from her suppliers 30 years ago.  She managed to grow her business through her hard work and commitment.  She serves her customers on her own as her husband travels a lot with his work.  What Juana likes about her business is that the profits she makes have enabled her to support her husband, who is a heavy machinery operator.  She has also provided her children, who are her pride and joy, with a better quality of life and an education.  She also feels like a productive woman and enjoys being busy.  On the contrary, what Juana does not like about her work is that some of her customers ask to buy on credit which she does not allow because she has had bad experiences with this.  As she has a regular customer base, she sees no reason to provide this kind of service.  Juana tells us that she does not have many household expenses and so her only plans are to keep her business running.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels comfortable and happy with the financial support that she receives which allows her to make progress in her business.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.  Juana feels happy to be a member of her community bank as she considers them all to be responsible and supportive people.  She will use the sum of 2,000 soles that she has requested to invest in buying merchandise, such as general products, wholesale.  She will also buy sodas at more affordable prices.  This will allow her to enjoy a better profit margin."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":480.65,"image":{"id":927831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of products, and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":302.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":312.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":327.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":340.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":352.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":365.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":230.49,"local_amount":614.63,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":622.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836187,"comment":null},{"amount":122.63,"local_amount":327.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":331.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245950,"comment":null},{"amount":127.53,"local_amount":340.08,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":344.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T19:14:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":362390,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A la vivienda del se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Luis le esta haciendo falta el vitropiso pero no cuenta con el dinero necesario para realizar la mejora.

From there he began to expand, looking for new clients in other villages as he is currently still doing.\r\n\r\nTheir sales are high as they are the distributors for the area assigned to them.  They sell banans directly to businesses such as shops, restaurants and retail outlets in the market.

With their Kiva loan they will buy bananas directly, guaranteeing better pries which he will be able to pass on to his customers.

Her husband went to Russia for work. Sayragul lives with her daughter. Sayragul's main line of work is fatting and reselling cattle and agriculture. She began this in 1992 with an initial investment of 3,000 som; today she has three cows and thirty sheep, bringing in around 15,000 a month from selling dairy products. At this moment, Sayragul's family cultivates 2.2 hectares of irrigated land, where they grow potatoes and perennial grasses.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\".  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.

is 29 years old, married with 4 children.\r\n\r\nSinavailemalama owns and operates a business venture planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. She has 2 years of experience in this business. Sinavailemalama needs a loan of 1,500 WST to purchase weed-killers, such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinavailemalama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Sinavailemalama's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and thE. are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\".  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

is a married mother, who is 20 years old, with one child.\n\nMolly owns and operates a business venture, driving a taxi.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Molly needs a loan of WST 1500 to maintain her vehicle.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn 2010, Molly joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Molly's second loan with SPBD. \n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Opetela's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3. The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is 24 years old and married. She has one child.\r\n\r\nFilomena owns and  operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro (a potato-like tuber) for sale. She has one year of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nFilomena needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 WST or US $208 per week) to financially support the immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nFilomena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Filomena's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She has many years of experience in this business. Samalaulu needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nSamalaulu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Samalaulu's fifth loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score. For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

52, is married and she has five children.\r\n\r\nSasauli owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting bananas for sale. She has many years of experience in this business.    Sasauli needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets and knives. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sasauli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sasauli's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

52, is a married woman with nine children.\r\n\r\nSinuu owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. She has two years of experience in this business. Sinuu needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 WST or US $208 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinuu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sinuu's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Solinuu's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

is 51 years old.

Fiaavae needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fiaavae joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Fiaavae's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.

Her husband is Emmanuel, who is retired.  She and her husband manage their household while operating her business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                 \r\n            \r\nAmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling at retail. She also sells honey bee products for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand the business. She and her husband have eight children.\r\n \r\nIn 2009, Senerita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Senerita's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.38,"image":{"id":928275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to

is a married woman, who is 23 years old and has no children.\r\n\r\nMiriama owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Miriama needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Miriama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Miriama's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.  SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":130.76,"image":{"id":928282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Vine joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Vine's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She has 2 years of experience in this business. Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Naomi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Naomi's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

age 67, plants and harvests taro and offers her harvested produce for sale. She has many years of experience in this business. Fofoa needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family. She and her husband have raised seven children.\r\n \r\nIn 2010, Fofoa joined SPBD* to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fofoa's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She has four years of experience in this business. Marata needs a loan of WST $2,000 to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand the business. She and her husband have four children.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, Marata joined SPBD* in order to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Marata's fifth loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

63, is married with three children. She owns and operates a business venture, selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Tafao needs a loan of $1,500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 WST or $167 US per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tafao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tafao's third loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

35, is married with four children. She owns and operates a business venture, selling both food and daily use products in the local community.  She has two years of experience in this business. Carolin needs a loan of $1500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 US per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carolin joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Carolin's second loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

54, is married with three children. She owns and operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro for sale. She has many years of experience in this business. Laepa needs a loan of $1,000 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 220 talas or $92 US per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Laepa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Laepa's first loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

48, is married with six children. She owns and operates a business venture selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members. She has two years of experience in this business. Tepalua needs a loan of $1500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase additional handicrafts to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 US per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nTepalua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tepalua's second loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

She has three years of experience in this business. Luaao needs a loan of WST $1900.00 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Luaao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Luaao's third loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Luse's third loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She has two years of experience in this business. Vaiola needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 200 WST or US $83 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nVaiola joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Vaiola's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.
