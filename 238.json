She has been involved in various selling businesses from a very early age, and she has been perfecting her skills in sales.  This has been very valuable to her since she made the decision to separate from her significant other and assume the various roles in her house.\r\n\r\nNow, thanks to her business of selling clothes in the stall she has at the market, she is supporting the family\u2019s needs.  Petronila works every day from nine in the morning until six at night.  During that time she waits on her customers, who are very demanding when they buy.  Therefore, she tries to keep her stall stocked with quality articles of clothing that are in style.  \r\n\r\nPetronila hopes that her business continues to improve so that she will soon be able to rent another stall and have an additional income.\r\n\r\nThis is her 18th loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  What she likes best about her community bank is the way that all of the group members work responsibly and with commitment.\r\n\r\nThe 1,500 PEN that she is asking for is to buy merchandise.  The winter time demands new clothes, and Petronila needs to meet her customers\u2019 demands.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":343975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":224.24},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":232.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":243.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":254.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":266.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":279.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.06},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.75,"local_amount":224.24,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":228.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211939,"comment":null},{"amount":77.46,"local_amount":232.38,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":236.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641467,"comment":null},{"amount":81.06,"local_amount":243.19,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":247.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080906,"comment":null},{"amount":84.83,"local_amount":254.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":259.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997048,"comment":null},{"amount":88.78,"local_amount":266.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":271.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842389,"comment":null},{"amount":93.12,"local_amount":279.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":284.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733957,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T18:13:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118655,"name":"Yelna Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yelna Isabel R.

They decided to name their group this because they like to work as a team like bees do.\r\n\r\nGrethel used to study medicine, but because of the economic situation of her family, she could no longer afford to study it, so she quit school to look for a job to improve her and her family's quality of life.  She decided to go to a beauty academy to be able to start her own salon.  She says she will use this small credit that FRAC is offering her to buy more beauty items so she can offer a better service and improve her work.\r\n       \r\nGrethel's dream is to become an important beauty advisor and to be known around the world.  She wants to have a big business, tohave more clients, and to give beauty classes so other people can increase their incomes.  She has done this work for 19 years, and she really likes her work and sharing her knowledge with people who are truly interested in learning.  She has a lot of patience for teaching.  She has told us that she hasn't found another institution that works as hard and as transparently as Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.      \r\n\r\nCurrently this group is made up of eight enterprising and active women.

For 8 years she has been in the business of selling seasonal fruits. Equipped with a tricycle, she transports her goods each morning to her vending location at one of the main street corners in the city. In addition to fruit, she also prepares juices for sale. She usually works alone, but her children help with the business during the holidays.  Thanks to the profits she has earned, Hirma is able to maintain her household. In the future, she hopes to have a stable vending location because the municipal police order her to move because she does not have a license. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Hirma is considered an integral and very responsible communal bank member, always encouraging a positive attitude within her group.

2006, Mrs. Feliciana B., 54, set up her food business. She sells food on the streets and viands for lunch, especially to people who don't have time to cook food. All the income that she earns from selling food helps in paying off the utility bills and in meeting the basic needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe is asking a loan of PHP 6,000 from CEVI to buy additional ingredients for food vending. She has been thinking of starting some other business to supplement her income. The loan will truly help her grow her business.\r\n\r\nLike other entrepreneurs, she is thankful to CEVI for helping her. According to her, the loan that she gets from joining the program of CEVI has strengthened her business. Every week during meetings, she learns different things from other entrepreneurs. CEVI provides its clients not only loans, but also trainings and insurance coverage services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":344048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

G. is from the village of Sto.

To make a living, Mercury owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector selling charcoal. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling charcoal products in the local community. Mercury has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Mercury joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercury is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional charcoal to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mercury from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married. She sells children's and women's underwear on the first floor of Hojannd's Chorshanbe market as well as at Hojand's Jumabazar and Yakshanbebazar markets. Two or three times a month Hayriniso travels to Istaravshan's wholesale market or Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan to purchase goods. Hayriniso has been our client since 2004, and she has always been an excellent client. This time she is applying for a loan in order to purchase women's and children's cotton underwear for the summer season. This would allow Hayriniso increasing the variety of goods she sells.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva

lives with her husband and her three children. She is a tailor who offers her great services to her neighbors. Her earnings are used to help cover her household expenses. Her work and her financial contribution have enhanced her self-esteem and her self-confidence. Djumagul is very proud of her work. This is the third time that Djumagul has requested a loan from IMON International, a Kiva partner. Having said this, Djumagul has an excellent history of on-time repayment. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She once experienced failure on her farm. She failed to buy insecticides and, as a result, she had a stunted harvest. She lost so much money from the very poor harvest that she doesn't want it to happen again! She has been doing everything possible to make her farm productive.  \r\n\r\nMarlyn is asking for a loan of Php 10,000 from CEVI. She will use the loan to buy needed fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides for her farm.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband Salvador and 1-year-old son in their house just outside of Saman\u00e1, Dominican Republic, and this is her first loan with Esperanza.  <P>\r\n\r\nCeleste currently sells various fruit juices from her home, and she says that many people come from all over her neighborhood to buy her juice.  She sells juices varying from cantaloupe, to mango, to cherry, and various mixtures of other fruits.  Celeste noticed that no one in the area was selling juices, and decided that she would be able to sell her juice easily due to the abundance of hot days in the Dominican Republic year-round.  Now, business is brisk with people seeking a refreshing drink on any given hot day.<P>\r\n\r\nCeleste, with her supportive husband encouraging her in her business endeavor, is seeking to use the profits from selling juice in order to continue her studies at a university.  She wants to someday be a teacher, and the money that her new business will bring in is going to help her afford the necessary classes.  This in turn will allow her to help provide a better home for her child, and a better living situation for the family, in addition to her husband\u2019s income.<P>\r\n\r\nFor additional loans from Esperanza which still need funding, click the link at the bottom of this profile.

(far right) is one member of the group Unidas para Seguir.  She lives with her three children and her husband a few kilometers outsiD. of Saman\u00e1, Dominican Republic.  Currently she works as the neighborhood veterinarian, going from house to house helping in any way she can with animals.  She is on her eighth loan with Esperanza, and currently sells and administers vaccines, vitamins and antibiotics in her neighborhood.  She loves working with the animals, and after seeing a need for veterinary care, she took it upon herself to begin work in the area.  Many people she knows have pigs, so a majority of her work is with those animals, though she does do some work with cats, dogs and other animals as well.\r\n\r\nMelida has several goals for the future, as her business continues to grow.  Her additional income, along with the income her husband brings in fishing, will allow her to fix up her house \u2013 and to add an additional room or two as money allows.  On top of this, Melida dreams of someday owning a house with enough property outsiD. where she can raise cows.  She got a big smile on her face when talking about someday being able to raise cows of her own, rather than just tending to those owned by others.  For now, this is only a desire for Melida, as she uses much of her income just to help pay for food for the family.

Since she was very young Mar\u00eda has worked several jobs; eventually her age kept her from doing heavy labor that harmed her health, but didn't take away her desire to make progress. \r\n\r\nWith her and her husband's savings she set up a store in the house, which has been operating for 20 years.

Mar\u00eda hopes to keep her customers, who are a result of the good customer service she always tries to provide. Nevertheless, she has aspirations of her own and plans to improve her business with a greater variety of products and more space in which to sell new merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe has already had 13 loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA, which have strengthened her commitment to her community bank, where she collaborates with the diverse membership to continuously improve the group's organization.

The preparation of different dishes and sandwiches has become her largest source of income since the orders that she has are continuous, which reflects her skill in the kitchen. She has been doing this for 6 years from her home, where she prepares the different orders to take them to the social events where she has been hired and which occur more often during the holidays. She tries to take advantage of them even if she goes without sleep some nights since her earnings are very high. In order to attract more attention from clients, she participates in different food preparation workshops and always learns new ways to season and present the dishes. In this way, Micerina tries to learn a little more each day, since her wish is to expand her social networks in order to increase her orders and make herself known throughout her district. Likewise, she wants to set up a store in her home where she can have an additional business that will help her maintain a stable income.

Para un futuro cercano, Jorge desea un establo m\u00e1s grande y mejorarlo en cuanto a su infraestructura. Esta es la tercera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y \u00e9l es uno de los miembros de su banco comunal m\u00e1s comprometido y que participa activamente por el bienestar de su grupo. El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de una vaca de una buena raza.","en":"Jorge is 40 years old and lives with his wife and 3 children (ages 18, 14, and 12) in a house that they own. He tends to the cattle housed inside the barn built next door.  Every day, his wife and children assist him with the care of the animals by feeding them and cleaning the stalls.  Once the calves are weaned after several months of nursing, Jorge and his family go to the local livestock fair to sell the bulls, getting a good price for them. In addition, he sells the milk from his cows, as well as the potatoes and corn grown on his farm. In the near future, Jorge would like to build a larger barn and make overall improvements around his farm. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  Jorge is one of the more committed members of his communal bank and actively looks after the best interests of his group. The money he is requesting will be used to purchase a cow of good breed.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":344378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-29T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717168,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-29T04:19:36Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118881,"name":"Magdalena Lwamulungi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalena is the leader of a five-person group.

She is 44 and lives in her own home with her family, whom she cares for with a lot of love.  What she wants the most is to give them a good life.  Demetria leaves her home very early to sell her Andean products in the Manco Capac market (a very important market in the city of Juliaca).  She has a stand there where she sells potatoes, quinoa, geese, and other items.  She spends the whole day there hoping that customers will buy the products that she sells.  Demetria is very happy because her stand is very frequented.  She has had this business for 22 years, and what she likes the most about it is being able to converse with her customers because it makes her sales more pleasant.  The most difficult part of her job is having to stay at her stand all day to care for it.  She knows that she makes all of her efforts with the only goal of excelling at life.  In the near future, Demetria hopes to have a stand where she can sell her Andean products in more comfort and attend to her clients better.  This is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is willing to set aside part of her profits every day to pay back the credit with no problems.  In her communal bank, she is very loved since she brings happiness to the other members.

She lives alone in her own home and she hopes to have a better quality of life.  She spends her days fixing old bicycles, which she later sells at the Explanada Laguna Temporal (a place where there are markets in Juliaca).  The work she does is very good, and the bicycles end up almost like new.  This is why her stand in the market is very frequented.  Juliana likes fixing bicycles a lot since she has quite a bit of fun with it.  She has done this work for 15 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is having to do everything by hand.  It takes longer and makes her work exhausting.  In the near future, Juliana hopes to grow her business and improve her economic income, for which she is willing to work very hard.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Ra\u00fal, who is 47, and her beloved daughter, Natalia, who is12.  She sells nutritious products like potatoes, quinoa, geese, etc., in the Manco Capac market (a very important market in the city of Juliaca).  She is very happy and chatty, which is why her customers prefer to buy from her.  She also works with her daughter, who helps her with all of the sales that she makes.  Maria enjoys chatting with the people who have stands near her while she sells her products.  She has done this work for 15 years.  What she likes the least is that she gets dirty after every day of selling because of the dirt on the potatoes.  In the near future, Maria hopes to have a stand where she can sell her Andean products and in this way improve her quality of life to give her daughter a higher education.  This is her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is willing to make all of her payments on time because she doesn't want to cause any problems with her communal bank, where she is very loved by the other members.  With the 1,000 PEN she is requesting, she will buy more Andean products to increase her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":344465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-29T00:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990796,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211960,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641488,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080927,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":177.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997069,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-29T00:44:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118916,"name":"Rincon Portada Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la conocida feria 16 de julio ubicada en la zona del mismo nombre (ciudad de El Alto) ofrecen sus productos las integrantes de la asociaci\u00f3n \u201cRinc\u00f3n Portada\u201d pertenece al centro focal Alto Lima, est\u00e1 formado por once miembros que lograron consolidarse en este grupo hace cinco a\u00f1os aproximadamente.\nSe dedican a la venta de verduras, queso, medias, carne de pollo, ropa tejida a mano, tambi\u00e9n realizan tejidos artesanales, elaboran pipocas (palomitas de ma\u00edz) y tambi\u00e9n confeccionan colchones.\nAhora la asociaci\u00f3n Rinc\u00f3n Portada necesita comprar mercader\u00eda y materia prima  para aumentar su producci\u00f3n y posteriores ventas, tienen la seguridad que obtendr\u00e1n mejores ganancias.\n","en":"The members of the Rinc\u00f3n Portada association sell their products in the well known 16 de julio fair, which is located in the zone of the same name (city of El Alto).

Las Rositas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Las Rositas es un grupo de 10 socias que viven en la comunidad de Ingapirca, aproximadamente media hora fuera de la ciudad de Cuenca en el sur de Ecuador. Es un grupo que reci\u00e9n se form\u00f3 hace menos de dos a\u00f1os, pero las socias han sido muy cumplidas y responsables y el banco casi se maneja solo, sin mucha ayuda de su promotora de cr\u00e9dito. \n\nSon se\u00f1oras muy c\u00e1lidas y cari\u00f1osas, y est\u00e1n muy animadas con ser uno de los primeros bancos comunales de la Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR para entrar a Kiva. La mayor\u00eda de las socias se dedican a la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda. \n\nPor ejemplo, la se\u00f1ora Maria tiene 25 a\u00f1os y vive con su pareja y su hijo de 5 a\u00f1os. Ella trabaja en la casa cuidando a su hijo y criando cuyes y gallinas; actualmente tiene 40 cuyes y 36 gallinas. Est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito de $150 para poder construir peque\u00f1as casas para sus gallinas, porque si no se las cuida bien se mueren o ya no ponen huevos. Su meta para el futuro es construir una casa para su familia; actualmente est\u00e1 viviendo en la casa de sus suegros. Ella nunca hab\u00eda sacado un cr\u00e9dito antes de conocer a la Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, y dice que no conoce ninguna otra instituci\u00f3n que ofrece pr\u00e9stamos en su comunidad. \n\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria Asunci\u00f3n tiene 35 a\u00f1os y es casada con un hijo de 5 a\u00f1os. Ella siembra hortalizas como zanahorias, cebollas y ajo, y tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda animales. Actualmente tiene 30 cuyes, 15 gallinas y una vaca. A veces vende sus verduras en el mercado de Cuenca; viaja cada dos semanas a la ciudad para vender. Ella est\u00e1 pidiendo un pr\u00e9stamo de $100 para invertir en la compra de semillas de zanahoria y cebolla y la compra de abono para sus terrenos. Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con su banco comunal, y dice que entr\u00f3 al grupo porque le conviene, como su promotora viene al pueblo mismo para hacer las reuniones y entregar los cr\u00e9ditos. Su meta para el futuro es poner una cr\u00eda de pollos con pollos de la ciudad (en vez de pollos del campo, los cuales est\u00e1 criando actualmente). Los pollos de la ciudad son un poco m\u00e1s complicados para criar, nos cuenta, porque son m\u00e1s delicados, pero crecen r\u00e1pido y son de mejor calidad, por ende ganar\u00eda mas al venderlos. \n\nOtras socias usar\u00e1n sus pr\u00e9stamos para comprar abono para sus terrenos y para comprar cr\u00edas de chanchos. El grupo est\u00e1 muy comprometido con pagar este pr\u00e9stamo de manera puntal y responsable. \n\n","en":"The Las Rositas Communal Bank is a group of 10 members who live in the Ingapirca community, about a half hour outside the city of Cuenca in southern Ecuador. The group formed relatively recently less than two years ago, but the members have been very reliable and responsible. The bank practically runs itself without too much help from their loan officer.<br> \r\nThey are very warm, kind-hearted women, and are very eager to be one of Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR\u2019s top communal banks to join Kiva. Most of the members work in agriculture and cattle farming.<br>\r\nFor example, Maria is 25 years old and lives with her partner and 5-year-old son. She works at home, looking after her son and raising guinea pigs and chickens. She currently has 40 guinea pigs and 36 chickens. She is requesting a $150 loan to build a chicken coop because if they aren\u2019t well looked after they die or don\u2019t lay eggs. Her future goal is to build a house for her family; she currently lives in the house of her in-laws. She had never taken out a loan before finding out about Fudaci\u00f3n ESPOIR and says that she doesn\u2019t know of any other credit institutions in her community.<br> \r\nMaria Asunci\u00f3n is 35 years old and married with a 5-year-old son. She grows vegetables like carrots, onions and garlic, and also raises animals. She currently has 30 guinea pigs, 15 chickens and one cow. She sometimes sells her produce at the Cuenca market; she travels to the city every two weeks to sell there. She is requesting a $100 loan to purchase carrot and onion seeds, and fertiliser for her land. This is her third loan with her communal bank. She says that she joined the group because it suited her well and her loan officer comes to the town to run the meetings and distribute the loans. Her future goal is to raise a flock of chickens from the city (instead of the country chickens she currently raises). The chickens from the city are a little more difficult to raise, she says, because they are more delicate, but they grow quickly and are better quality, and therefore more profitable.<br> \r\nThe other members will use their loans to purchase fertiliser and pigs. The group is very committed to being punctual and responsible in repaying this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva

C. is from the village of Santa Cruz, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 26 years old. Sheryl is married and has three infant children. To make a living, Sheryl owns & operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Sheryl has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sheryl joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sheryl is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell to expand her product offering. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Sheryl from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Santa Cruz, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 29 years old. Whirlen is married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, Whirlen owns & operates a fruit stand. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruit in the local community. Whirlen has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Whirlen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Whirlen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. Whirlen is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Whirlen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 52-year-old rice grower with three children. In the past, Enriquita worried about how she was going to afford her huge family expenses. However, her partnership with Kiva partner, Community Economic Ventures, Inc. (CEVI), gave her capital to sustain her one-hectare farm. CEVI also helped Enriquita start up a sari-sari store (convenience store) business. \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, Enriquita wants to apply for a loan of 8,000 PHP from CEVI. She will use the loan to buy good-quality rice seeds as well as fertilizers.

She works as Education Representative in the Santo Tomas municipality. She has 3 grown-up children who live with her and help out with household expenses. Yamileth's work schedule is from 8:00 to 5:00 p.m. during normal times, but usually she doesn't have a set schedule.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting her first loan to replace the roof of her home.
