She has raised three children. Her two daughters are married and live separately. Her son, 20, serves in the army. <P>\r\n\r\nNurjan\u2019s husband works as a director of rayon\u2019s movie directorate. As for Nurjan, she is a housewife. However, even staying at home and doing her regular housewife\u2019s duties; Nurjan manages to earn some money by selling milk. She sells up to ten liters daily, which allows her to make fifty dollars a month. It is a sizable amount of money, considering that they once invested just seventy dollars in buying a cow. And taking into account twenty years of a housewife\u2019s life, it is largely due to these humble earnings of hers and of course her husband\u2019s serious job that they have been able to refurnish their house, buy new domestic equipment, give their children a proper education and build a building opposite their house. <P>\r\n\r\nNurjan has decided to diversify her daily routine by keeping sheep. She intends to fatten them and resell them.  To do this, she is in need of a loan. Among her near-future plans is to marry off her son and build a new house. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nKamchybek, 37, is engaged in cattle breeding. He has a wife and three children. Even though his wife sells milk and thus contributes to the family\u2019s budget, Kamchybek\u2019s earnings are barely enough to support the whole family. He hopes to get a loan to buy materials for building a new shed. <P>\r\n\r\nKalima, 57, is a mother of three children. Her spouse is a math teacher at school. Ten years ago, they bought a calf. Since then, Kalima has been selling milk. Kalima\u2019s long-time dream has been to have a new bedroom suite. As Kalima earns a little, this loan might enable her dream to come true.<P>\r\n\r\nAsylkul, 52, is married. She has brought up four children. Currently she sells milk, making 85 dollars a month and otherwise stays at home. Her husband is a driver. Several years ago, she bought two lambs. After selling them Asylkul bought a calf and raised it.

Gunjilmaa is 41 years old and lives with her husband and three children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.  In 2000, she moved her family to the city in the hope of finding better opportunities and improving their life. In her previous home of Govisumber province in southeastern Mongolia, Gunjilmaa worked as a salesperson at a local grocery store. Upon settling in Ulaanbaatar, she and her husband started a clothes selling business out of a stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in the city. Since then, their business has grown steadily and they have used their profits to open a second stall at the market. Today, their business has capital that exceeds 1.5 million tugrugs (approx. $1,036 USD) and operates with a profit margin of 30-40%. In the future, Gunjilmaa hopes to provide her children, who all currently attend  secondary school, with a quality education.

As any wife, living in rural area she keeps a household and busies herself raising two sweeties. She has experience in keeping cattle. In the past they kept some cattle, but had to sell the livestock as they needed money to make a repair on their house. Then, on one of their daughter\u2019s birthday their relatives made a present: gave them a calf. <P>\r\n\r\nCurrently, they are engaged in making a repair in their home. They have already bought new furniture and routine repairs are about to be over. However, there is a problem for almost every family living in Kyrgyz village. Last year,  the drastic reduction of water levels in the Toktogul reservoir led to failure in capability of the Toktogul hydropower station to provide sufficient electricity for the population. The Government cut off 3-phase current for all households around the country, and people living in houses had to heat their homes with coal. Meerim\u2019s family was among them.<P>\r\n\r\n This year they are planning to stock up on coal in advance, since the situation with allowing usage of 3-phase current is still uncertain. Meerim needs a loan to purchase three tons of coal and with the rest of the loan buy an armored door. As a matter of fact, Meerim and her husband have many plans ahead: finish repairs, buy two cows, a car and build a building and a shed for cattle. <P>\r\n\r\nMeerim's partners are Aiganysh, Mairamkul, Tamara, and Eliza. Only Eliza is 22 and single. The rest of them are in their mid 40s, married and have two to three children each.  Eliza works in a TV station as a manager. She needs a loan to buy sand-blocks for building a fence around her house. Aiganysh needs a loan to buy fireboard and chipboard for her ceiling. Mairamkul needs a loan to buy plastic windows and hay for cattle. Tamara needs a loan to buy hay and a refrigerator. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

In the process of gaining experience, she already had a firm determination to open her own office. It took her many years of hard work, perseverance and patience until she was able to save US$ 1500. At last she accomplished that and opened a dental office and even bought necessary appliances and equipment. <P>\r\n\r\nSo, for three years, she has been her own boss. Now she makes US$ 500 a month. Since any loan is a quick access to get what you need, Ainura has decided to get a loan to buy photo-filling equipment.  Ainura has some far-reaching plans for making her dental room one of the best in the local area by creating service system for clients and buying high quality materials for dental treatment. <P>\r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s partners are: Dilbarbyu, Syinat and Nargiza. Dilbarbyu, 47, is divorced. Her three daughters and son being married live separately and little daughter goes to school. To make a living she sells cigarettes, mineral water and apples. Dilbarbyu needs a loan to purchase more goods and increase her turnover. <P>\r\n  \r\nSyinat, a widow of 44, has two daughters. She has her own office\/shop, where she provides minor services: opening foreign pages, loading units for cell phones, Xerox. Syinat needs a loan to buy a computer. She wants to provide typing and other computer services. <P>\r\n\r\nNargiza, 23, is married, a mother of one child. She raises sheep and sells milk. Her husband is an odd-job worker on a construction site. Nargiza hopes to get a loan to buy a milch cow. She wants to earn more money from selling milk to save it for building a new shed. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

M. is from the village of San Simon, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 60-years old and married with five adult children. Josefina owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Josefina has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Josefina joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josefina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Josefina is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Y. is from the village of Pob. Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She is 55-years old and married with two adult children. Nelma owns and operates a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general clothing services to local community members. Nelma has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 7,000.00 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Nelma joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000.00 PHP from PMPC. Nelma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional equipment and tools such as needles and threads. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Nelma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nThe Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Rebecca joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be her fifth from HSPFI. Rebecca plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income and support her children's education. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

The main source of income for the business comes from hauling junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Frankilino has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Frankilino joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Frankilino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. He is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional waste and junk material to sell. This loan will be his third from HSPFI.

R. is from the village of Labo, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 65 years old. Florajaida is widowed and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Florajaida owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Florajaida has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Florajaida joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florajaida has successfully repaid a previous loan  from GDMPC. Florajaida is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Florajaida from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":373444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a 41-year-old businesswoman who lives with her family in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. Her three oldest children are university students and the youngest is a secondary school student. Doljinjav  operates a mobile retail trading business in her town. With the help of her husband, who is a driver, she uses the family car to travel throughout the countryside selling goods to local farmers. In addition to her mobile business, Doljinjav also purchases dairy products from the farmers to sell at the local market or sometimes in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city. Doljinjav started her business in 2000 and has achieved success. Since she started, her business capital has increased to more than five times its starting amount. She uses the business' profits to pay her children's university tuition, which is very expensive for the average rural family in Mongolia. Doljinjav is a very hard-working and open-minded person and says, \"My dream is to one day have my own grocery store.\" She is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug (approx. $690 USD) loan to purchase more

Her husband works as an agriculture specialist for the province governor's office, her middle son and daughter are university students, and her youngest daughter is a high school student. She also has a son who currently lives and works in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city. \r\n\r\nDulamjinkhuu operates a dairy trading business from a rented stall at the local market in her town. She purchases the dairy goods from local farmers in the countryside and sells them at her stall. \r\n\r\nDulamjinkhuu started her dairy business in 1992 with capital of 200,000 tugrugs (approx. $138 USD). Due to her hard work,  she has made her business very successful and has used the profits to greatly improve her family's quality of life. Today, her business capital exceeds 2,000,000 tugrugs (approx. $1,380 USD). Dulamjinkhuu's dream is to provide her children with a quality education so that they can become smart and improve their lives. In the future, Dulamjinkhuu said, \"I always dream of owning my own comfortable work place.\" \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 3.5 million tugrug to purchase more goods for her dairy business.

is living a simple life in Sto. Domingo, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya with her family. He just graduated from high school in March 2009 at the age of 30. He believes that one is never too old enough to pursue his studies. However, he could not continue on to college due to lack of financial resources. Instead, he will help his parents cultivate their rice field and vegetable farm. He wanted to save for his future family. But, in the meantime, he will help his parents to earn a living. \r\n\r\nThey get their major source of income from farming. At the moment, Ryan is now cultivating their farmland twice a year by planting rice and a variety of vegetables. He is now asking for a loan of PHP36,000 from Kiva lenders.

is a 55 years old, retiree, who lives with her two adult sons in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. From an early age her sons took much interest in automobiles. They both learned how do drive and became skilled in auto repair. In 2007, taking advantage of her sons' skills, Tsend opened a tire repair service shop with them. Currently, the boys operate the tire repair shop during the day and drive taxis in the evenings.  Over the last two years, business has become very stable. They have developed a good reputation in their community and have many regular customers.

C. is a business manager of her own. Since she lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines, she is in the fishing business. She is hardworking and full of energy in her search for a better life. She is married to Binedicto who is 37 years old and a passenger boat driver.  She is mother to three princesses; all of whom are still dependents.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2006 her dream of escaping poverty led her to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the hope of having access to capital for her business. Previously, she was involved in producing bamboo products such as sets, sofa and other products. But that was laborious and the raw materials were expensive. That experience had driven her to shift her business into fish farming. Since she is living on the island, they are surrounded with water and the major source of income of the villagers is fishing. The village is well known to other towns as a source of fish.\r\n<P>\r\nFor two years Carolina has been running the fish farming business and she is happy to say that the business brings her enough proceeds to sustain her family. She is happy to see her business growing. Now on her 5th loan, she is asking for  25,000 pesos to pay for 2 bundles of fish nets, 100 pieces of bamboo, nails, and fingerlings; everything needed for a fish cage.\r\n<P>\r\nShe hopes that her business will grow and is looking forward to having additional fish cages and sending her children to school until they can finish college and find jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":373579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To make and stock

Veronica is a 37-year-old mother of three boys, and she is happily married to Teofilo, who is a 43-year-old fisherman. She lives in a remote island village outside the town of Binangonan, in the province of Rizal in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband is a fisherman and has a meager income, and she wants to help him grow his income.  In 2007 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines.  She hoped for access to capital to start a business, and ASHI provided her loans.  She carefully used them as capital on her fish cage business, and her husband has also partnered with her.\r\n<p>\r\nThe business provides good income for Veronica and her family.  Now on her fourth loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos to pay for 2 bundles of fish nets, nails, bamboos, assorted fingerlings, transportation, and labor expenses.  They will cultivate the fingerlings in her fish cages until they are ready to harvest.\r\n<p>\r\nVeronica believes that her business will grow.  She dreams of expanding it to construct additional fish cages, and of sending all of her children to school until they finish college.  She believes that with the poor situation of the Philippines, the wealth that she can leave to her children is knowledge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":373634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

They found it to be profit -sounded.\nNow on her  4th loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish cage business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for  2 bundles of fish nets, 60 pieces of bamboos, fingerlings, transportation and labor costs.\nThe fingerlings will be cultured in the fish cage until it will be ready to harvest. They will sell fishes in the market and sometimes will go directly to their fish cage to buy fish.

She ihusbandzs happily living with some of her children and with her husband Napoleon who is a fisherman and is 52 years of age.\nShe dreams of getting out from the spiral of poverty. In 2006, she joined ASHI(Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines with hope of having access to capital to start a business. Before, she and her husband are partners in their business the bamboo set making. But considering their age, the business is quite tiring and laborious. When she received her first loan from ASHI, she constructed a fish cage in the lake. That was four years ago already. Now her business is getting bigger and brings her good income.\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 18,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish cage business. The loan will be used to pay for 2 fish cages, renovation and repair of her other fish cages, 30 pieces of bamboos and labor expenses.\nShe is looking forward that with the trend of fishing as main source of income in the island is in demand; her business will grow and will bring her enough income for her family. She dreams of sending her younger children to school until they finish college.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":373648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for 2

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Kanoat is spoken of by her clients in a very caring way. She is married and has a child. Some years ago, she decided to dedicate herself, in an ambulatory way, to selling foodstuffs and opened her grocery near her house. Due to the large demand for her typical foodstuffs, she wishes in the future to open a cafe, which will offer better and more comfortable service to the population and increase the quantity of clients. \r\n\r\nAll of this would allow her to generate a larger income for her family, with the aim to elevate their quality of life and education. In order to carry this out, she is proposing to solicit a loan of 4,500 Somoni that will be invested in purchasing more foodstuffs for her grocery.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sharofat is 53 years old. She is married and the mother of three children. Sharofat is doing all she can to ensure the best future for her children. That is the reason that she has been running her own business for 17 years already. She has a place in the central local market for selling foodstuffs such as rice, macaroni, oil, sugar, spices and other items. She works from 8:00 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. The business is stable and that allows her to improve the level of her family's living conditions. Now Sharofat needs a loan for increasing the range of goods she sells. For this purpose, she requests 4,800 Somoni. Sharofat and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She hopes to be able to boost sales, and will only be able to do so with the help of this loan, which will allow her to purchase a greater amount of ingredients to increase pupusa production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":373742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Zacatecoluca, departamento de La Paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2009-08-21T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":637,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T12:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86990332,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T13:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96902688,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103741913,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110629700,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118026648,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123865515,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128898342,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136626515,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144660581,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":63.7,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151845023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-21T02:46:40Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:19:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":130857,"name":"Quadri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Quadri sells spiritual items that are used in praying, like incense, oils, crucifixes and so on.

She has 3 grown children who have their own families. One of her daughters lives with her. <p>\r\nShe stated that she has always liked retail and that she used to have a general store at home that was well-stocked and had many customers. Her husband helped her with the income at the time, buying and selling fruits and vegetables throughout the neighborhoods of Lambar\u00e9, Asunci\u00f3n, as well as other places further inland. He had a truck to do this work. <p>\r\nShe went on to say that she had to close her general store due to the fact that her husband became very ill and she had to attend to him since he was hospitalized for a long time. <p>\r\nShe currently has the support of one of her children who works selling and buying merchandise, and seasonal fruits and vegetables. She states that this line of work requires a lot of sacrifice because she has to leave her house very early in the morning to shop for products, then travel throughout the Chaco zone because there are few suppliers who visit the small businesses there. <p>\r\nShe also likes to sew in her free time, which is why she works with a company who provides her with the raw materials needed to make different types of towels. These two sources of income are helping her, and little by little, she is investing in home improvement. <p>\r\nShe likes to work with microloans because they allow her access to greater benefits when purchasing merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

Second-hand shoes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These shoes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. <P>\r\n\r\nBeatrice works at the business for 13 hours per day, 6 days per week. Beatrice currently earns about 80 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy more shoes in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>\r\n\r\n One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":373811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more shoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105928,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023039,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868280,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757476,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146570,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984715,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T00:56:15Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":130905,"name":"Las Cari\u00f1osa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201clas Cari\u00f1osas\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Petrona y conformado por 16 socias las cuales van cursando ya su segundo ciclo demostrando honestidad, responsabilidad y  sobre todo ganas de salir adelante; la mayor\u00eda de sus miembros se dedican a la venta de comida, pan, dulces en porter\u00edas de colegios, leche y a actividades como la confecci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir, carpinter\u00eda, transporte de pasajeros y a la m\u00fasica.

Her picture was taken during a later visit). They are small-scale businesspeople in Magburaka town and have benefited from previous SMT loans. Previous SMT loans have made a lot of improvements in their lives and businesses. As a result of such loans, they were able to improve their businesses, make better sales and profit and consequently improve their standard of living. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are again requesting a new loan of Le 4,200,000 to further strengthen their businesses.\n\nMemuna L. (in the middle) is the leader of this group. Memuna is approximately forty years of age. She was born in Lunar, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married in Magburaka town to a businessman and they have five children together.

When it comes to managing her business, she doesn\u2019t follow a set schedule and she is her own boss.  She tells us that she started with 300 soles to buy 3 packs of sodas.  She did very well, so she gradually invested more into her business.\r\n<p>\r\nHer business continues to operate and she is well-known by her customers in the neighborhood and from elsewhere.  With her loan of 1000 soles, Rosa Graciela will buy more beverages such as sodas of different flavors, sizes, and brands, as well as mineral water (both carbonated and non-carbonated).  She will also use some of the money to buy ingredients such as cornmeal, sugar, and cloves to give a rich flavor to her beverages.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa Graciela has many goals ahead of her and she is motivated to meet every one of them.

What follows are details of the activities they have achieved.  \r\n\r\nMs. LEYLA DEL CARMEN M. has been selling cosmetics for four years. She carries out the majority of those sells on the street. Leyla decided to go into business to support her companion in covering some of their family expenses. Leyla lives with her partner and has 3 children who depend on her.

From the earnings her business has generated, she is able to cover 100% of her personal expenses. \r\n\r\nMrs. JULIA AMPARO O. has been selling food for 8 years. Her regular clients are policemen. Julia made the decision to do this business because next to her house is a dining room open to everyone. But 8 years ago this business was closed and a lot of people had been going there to eat regularly. This made putting the business there a good idea since she practically had permanent customers. Since that time, Mrs. Julia has been selling food to the policemen. She is married and her husband works in agriculture.

V. is from the village of Biasong. She is 32 years old. Analyn is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Analyn owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Analyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Analyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Analyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

(ASHI) and started her own business buying and selling salt to augment her husband's income. At the start, profit wasn't really enough to sustain her business and supply her family's needs. Nevertheless, Laila used her income wisely so she was able to repay her loan on time, so that she would be able to take out a bigger loan in order to grow her business. Her business has done so well that Laila has been able to use her profits to purchase a motorcycle for use in her business. She also has been able to start another business, hog fattening (pig raising), in order to augment her profit from her other business. With hog fattening, a pig can be raised in four months, and the selling price is double the price of the piglet.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her business success, Laila wants to to take out a bigger loan from ASHI to expand her business and make it more stable in preparation for her children's education and future.

is 66 years old. She has been farming rice for seven years. She used a loan from well-off people in her village to start her rice farm. Although the local loan had a high monthly interest rate, Erlinda had no choice but to take it, despite the risk, because she needed her own business to meet the needs of her two children, especially their education. \r\nErlinda's husband is a farmer, so it was not a problem to find someone to look after and work in the rice field. \r\n\r\nWhen Erlinda joined Ahon Sa HIrap, Inc. (ASHI), she was able to get a low-interest loan for her business that was easy to pay, because the mode of payment depends on her ability to pay. She then stopped borrowing from usurious money lenders in her village. Since then, the woman's business started to earn larger profits. With her business profits, she has been able to expand her business and send her two children to college (one has already graduated), and she has started another business raising livestock in her back yard.\r\n\r\nErlinda is still an active member of ASHI and has maintained her good track record of repayment and attendance at weekly center meetings. She wants to borrow a larger amount to expand and improve her business. She wants her rice production business to become stable and profitable so she can help needy people and relatives in her

H. is a farmer in Srae Boeng village in Takeo province. She owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Uch Kimsay, is a hard working man who has been hired by the villagers to use the electric cow for plowing on the field. Now this couple has a problem because they need some money to buy fertilizer to support the rice field and to fix electric cow. In order to solve this problem, Mrs. Kim ChH.

In the dry season, the weather in his village is quite hot and the plants turn yellow. The road to enter the village is unsealed and bumpy, and it is about a 1 hour drive from the TLM Baun Branch Office to this village.\r\n\r\nMatias leads a group called Mekobaun A1 Group; the group has 7 members. Matias is 34, married and has been blessed with 3 little children: Musa H. - 5 years old, Ibrahim H. - 3 years old and Alfred H. - 2 years old. \r\n\r\nTo fulfill his family\u2019s daily needs, Matias works hard  cultivating his farm. There are coconuts, bananas and beans and corn planted on the farm. He usually starts his day at 7.00 am and works until 12.00 pm; he returns home to have lunch and rest for 1 hour and then goes back to work until 05.00 pm. He usually takes public transport to sell his agricultural products at Oeba Market. It costs IDR 15,000 per return trip. By selling his agricultural products Matias is only able to generate small income of about IDR 50,000 to IDR 150,000 per week; it depends on which crops he can harvest from the farm. Even though Matias only generates a small income from his farm  he always tries his best to supply his family needs every day. \r\n\r\nMatias has a plan to renovate his house, to better meet his family needs and provide a better future for his children. For this reason, Matias is interested in joining the TLM Cattle Fattening Program. He is requesting a loan amounting IDR 3,400,000 to buy cattle to be fattened over a twelve month period. He hopes that he will be able to generate profit that can be used to buy building materials to renovate his house. The other group members of Mekobaun A1 are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened. All of them hope to have a better life.

Bokong Village is situated about 27 km and a two-hour drive from Kupang City. The community in this village, including the group members, leans on agricultural products to support their family lives. They also depend on animal husbandry (pigs, chickens and cows) when meeting family needs for a particular moment (e.g. they could sell their livestock to pay a child\u2019s education fees or when one of their family members is unwell).\r\n\r\nMost of community in Bokong Village has a background in farming. They usually sell their agricultural products, such as bananas, coconuts and beans, at Inpres Market. The challenge that the community faces in running their businesses is the lack of public transport to reach Inpres market as it only available three days a week, whereas the local market in this area only operates on Tuesdays. \r\n\r\nMekobaun A2 Group is led by Petrus A., a 60-year-old farmer. Petrus is respected by the group members as he has the ability to lead and also has constructive thoughts. He was born and grew up in Bokong Village. He is married to Agustin and they have five children: Jumlina A., who is 33, graduated from University and married; Sarce, who is 29 and working in Malaysia; Becy A., who is 26 and a senior high school graduate who spends her days helping her parents on the farm; Julianus A., who is a 24-year-old junior high school graduate and motorcycle taxi driver; and Welem A. , who is 22 and in the third semester of the university.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill his family's daily needs, Petrus plants cassavas, corns, bananas and beans. His family is relying on the agricultural products and this is the reason why Petrus should work hard. Currently, Petrus has to finance Welem\u2019s education at the university. Petrus also raises pigs and goats to be sold so he can pay his son\u2019s education fees. Petrus' wife, Agustin, also helps him to generate more income by weaving cloth to be sold but the income generated by Petrus and Agustin is not enough to meet their family's needs.     \r\n\r\nPetrus got information that TLM Foundation provides loans to assist poor farmers like him. Together with the other community members who are interested in joining the program, they formed a group to receive a loan so they can buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. Petrus is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle.

So when her parents who previously owned the farm supplies store she now operates decided to pass on the business to her, she had mixed feelings - excited because it had the potential of providing a steady income, enough to support her family, and at the same time she was doubtful that she could make a go of it, especially as she did not have the necessary working capital to buy stock for resale.\r\n\r\nSo when a friend told her about NWTF-Project Dungganon, she grabbed the opportunity to join and gain access to a credit line that she badly needed to make her business survive. She also admits that the discipline of paying back her loans made her realize the importance and value of good financial management.\r\n\r\nNow on her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anecita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to enable her to buy more stock for resale in her farm supplies shop.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example. Mahmud has worked in farming for 20 years, and is very happy with the support of IMON International, as thanks to the loans he has received he has been able to plant more crops. His plans for his family are to improve their living conditions and well being. Mahmud started this activity on his own. He plans to be able to diversify his crops. With the proceeds of the loan he will buy supplies and fertilizers for his fields, in order to obtain better production and ability to sell at a better price. Be an important part of the growth of Mahmud\u2019s business.\n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Azimjon says he comes from a humble family and from a very young age, he helped his father in the fields, which is why he never finished his studies. Despite that, he grows grapes on his farming land. Azimjon comments that he is very thankful for what he has and thanks to the dedication and support from his family, he can have a dignified life and give a better life to his children. At this time, Azimjon is applying for a loan in order to buy more raw material such as: seeds, insecticides, fertilizers, chemical products, etc. that help him cultivate more.    \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
