Only one child is under 15 and some are in school. She lives in Ntasen, an area in Bamenda, in the north-west region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nHer major challenges in life has been the difficultly of her children dropping out of school and inadequate capital to start a business for herself before joining GHAPE. She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan, she plans to buy pig feed, firewood, medicines for the animals and to pay for the maintenance of her pigsty and the transportation of her newly bought piglets to their rearing site. \r\n\r\nGrace knows her business is going to succeed because she has acquired some basic training in financial management and pig rearing from GHAPE. She has also chosen to diversify her income by investing some of her capital in a firewood business and she has the land to support a successful business. The loan, if granted, will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper rates, providing firewood to her neighbors. She joined GHAPE in 2006 and has since successfully borrowed and repaid loans four times.\r\n\r\nShe will reinvest her profits back into her business and use part to it to care for her family. She will also use the proceeds to finish a construction plan she earlier started, building two new rooms. Her children\u2019s school needs will also be taken care of.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan she plans to buy Irish potatoes, cocoyams, yellow yams and local plums.

She joined GHAPE in 2008, since then she has successfully borrowed and repaid loans two times.\r\n\r\nShe will plough back some of her profit into her business and use part to care for her family.

He lives at Mile 90 Nsongwa, a quarter in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon. He is a farmer. He cultivates crops for sale. \n\nHis activity was hindered by insufficient capital to buy his farm inputs, but since he joined GHAPE in 2005 there has been mutual support through the loans he obtains from GHAPE.\n\nWith his activity he is able to provide food, especially vegetables, in his community. This will go a long way to improving their diet. Also, he sells cheaper than others since he is the one who cultivates the items himself. Also, people will buy from him and resell in markets which will help provide employment. \n\nGiven this loan he intends to expand his farm with the cultivation of rice at Wum which is located also in the North West region. He will pay for labour; buy fertilizer, chemicals, potato seeds, and manure. He will also continue his gardening around his home. He hopes his business will succeed because he has been doing this business for a long time which has enabled him to gain a lot of experience.

ceremonial center.  It is said that not long ago there were deer here, but as of a few years ago they were gone.  \n\nDo\u00f1a Angelina has a group that calls themselves \"Las Artesanas del Fresno\" (The Artisans of Fresno).  They are so named because the 8 members are artisans who know how to do embroidery and sewing, and they are from El Fresno.  It is for this reason that they are named this way.\n\nDo\u00f1a Angelina works buying fabric by the meter for making bedspreads, blankets and waistcoats.  She has 15 years of experience and knows how to embroider very well.  She tells us that there are several things that hinder sales.  For example, she tells us that in hot weather her embroidery does not sell; as her waistcoats are made from wool it is difficult for a person to want to buy one.  She also says that making sales is a gamble.  To be able to go out to make sales, she needs to bring everything she has made \u200b\u200bso as to educate her customer about her work, but while she may sell some items, she needs to return with the rest, which is why she tells us it's a gamble.  Another thing that makes it hard is carrying the items, as they are very heavy together which makes it very difficult to carry all her items.

The group is comprised of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro, who will use this loan to buy food for raising <i>mojarra<\/i> [a type of fish]; Ms. Mar\u00eda Fidela, who will buy pigs, sheep and bulls; Ms. Felipa and Ms. Mar\u00eda de la Luz, who will buy soap, sugar, milk and eggs; Ms. Patricia who will buy food for fattening her sheep; Ms. Mar\u00eda Mercedes who will buy pigs to fatten; and Ms. Virginia, who is going to buy vegetables and meat to make her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirgina is 51 years old and studied until the second year of primary school. She is married and has seven children, five of whom are grown up and working. Her two younger children are a 15 year-old boy who is in secondary school and a 9 year-old girl who attends primary school. Virginia sells steak, sausage and tripe tacos. She is requesting a loan to buy one burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat to prepare her tacos. She will also use part to install a floor where she sells her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirginia started her business 25 years ago because, with her husband out of work and her children still young, she lacked the necessary economic resources. She obtained a loan with her brother-in-law to put into her business and started to sell her tacos. Her business is important because it brings in profits when she's selling well. Virginia remembers once when her granddaughter was sick and she came up with 500 pesos to bring her to the doctor and to pay for her medicines. It was the profits from her business that made it possible for Virginia to pay.\r\n\r\nShe feels proud that the families who are her customers prefer her business and is proud when they say that her tacos are delicious. She reinvests her profits to buy ingredients to continue selling. Her daughter and her husband help her with the business, preparing and selling the tacos. Virginia's hopes and dreams are to make her business larger and for her youngest children to reach professional careers. She is happy to receive this loan because it's not just anywhere that you find people who help others unselfishly.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you very much for having confidence in us. We will not fail you, so that you will continue helping more people with their businesses and families.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro is missing in the photograph above."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":840329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat for preparing tacos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Fidela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201970,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807562,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618656,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572898,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T10:19:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":325700,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Teresa  de Jes\u00fas  tiene  treinta y ocho a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica  a la venta de  quesos desde hace siete a\u00f1os y a la venta de comida  desde hace tres  a\u00f1os.\nEsta muy contenta  por tener su propio negocio  y ver el fruto de su esfuerzo  ya que le va muy bien y obtiene muy buenas ganancias.\nElla estudio hasta la  primaria terminada, tiene  dos hijos una mujer Karina de  doce a\u00f1os de edad   y un var\u00f3n Gilberto de  quince a\u00f1os de edad  quienes le ayudan a  hacer los quesos.\nEsta muy agradecida  con fundacion realidad  por el apoyo  que le  dio cuando mas lo necesitaba  y con su esfuerzo ya cuenta con un local donde realiza sus  quesos y los vende. \nElla pidi\u00f3 el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar los materiales que necesita para la elaboraci\u00f3n de  quesos  como son: tinas, aros   y molino.\nEs una persona  con muchos sue\u00f1os para  sus  hijos como;   seguir ayud\u00e1ndoles para  que terminen sus estudios y tengan m\u00e1s oportunidades en la vida. \n","en":"Sra.

They both love and take care of their three young children.  Giovana and her family live in a rented house in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  Her days involve hard work.  Some time ago, she began selling candy, beverages, and food at a local school cafeteria to earn a good income.  Her business was the only one that catered to all of the students and teachers.  In addition, she weaves colorful and vibrant wool sweaters.  Thanks to her creativity, Giovana began selling to local brokers who sold her woven articles in the city of Oroya.  Her handiwork is well-received because of the cold weather.  She also receives the support of her husband, who transports vegetables, potatoes, and fruit all over the country with a truck.  Her husband has done very well in his job, so he plans to save enough money to buy a vehicle of his own.  \r\n<p>\r\nGiovana is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de San Pedro\u201d (Heart of San Pedro) and this will be her first loan with MFP.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is supporting her children on her own and tries to provide them with everything that they need because she does not want her children to feel the absence of their father.  This is why she has been involved in buying and selling women's fabrics and sewing for over five years.  She has orders for uniforms for school children, kindergartens and the like.  She has several apprentices who help her.  Shahlo wants to obtain a loan in the sum of $2500 for the purchase of fabrics for sewing school uniforms because schools start in September, and the demand for uniforms

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

David's parents are old and not capable of working anymore to make a living on their own. Last cropping season in May, he produced a good crop and earned about 40,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to provide for his family and live in a healthy environment, he began a small business dealing in household goods and appliances. Fourteen years ago, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was a salesperson on the streets and imported goods from nearby regions. Gradually, he was able to build up his business and started renting a sales point. Muazzan wants to expand the business and maximize his profits. He's requesting a loan of 2000$ in order to purchase household goods and appliances. He thanks all of his lenders in advance for their support and charity.

known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She really wants to raise her kids into well educated and conscientious adults. Iroda would like to borrow 1000 USA dollars to purchase school uniforms for sale in her store for the starting school season.

B\u1ea9y has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6.000.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, B\u1ea9y joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. B\u1ea9y has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8.288.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. B\u1ea9y is now requesting a new loan of 9.184.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory & provide working capital.  The will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.

With profits from his farming, Felicien wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":845459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support labor costs during rice production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2011-08-15T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicien","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":315000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":315000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T00:21:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":325822,"name":"Lourgen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourgen is 46 years old.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gulshan has been reselling jewelry for the last 12 years and has started her business with a tiny amount of money, expanding slowly. She is raising her children on her own so it is hard for her to provide for them and she always needs support. Every morning Gulshan leaves home and comes back late at night. The money which she makes is only enough for day-to-day spending and it's hard for her to save for the future. For this reason Gulshan would like to take out a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase more jewelry in bulk and expand her business, increasing her profits and improving the living conditions for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":351.2,"image":{"id":845518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase new jewelry inventory for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulshan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":201.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":226.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":228.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":227.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":246.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":245.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":253.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":267.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":277.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":286.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":299.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":303.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":313.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":321.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":334.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":343.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":353.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.31,"local_amount":201.46,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":204.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227339777,"comment":null},{"amount":48.79,"local_amount":226.95,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T08:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":230.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233368429,"comment":null},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":228.93,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":232.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238643562,"comment":null},{"amount":49,"local_amount":227.93,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":231.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244598000,"comment":null},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":247.3,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811998,"comment":null},{"amount":53.05,"local_amount":246.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":250.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257220687,"comment":null},{"amount":54.67,"local_amount":254.29,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":258.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T12:40:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":325849,"name":"Leonida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" \r\nA tricycle operator for almost seven years, Leonida, 60, did well enough to send her three children to school.

She lives in military housing with her family and also supports two granddaughters by sending them money to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe left Gaza on work assignment. She has been a nurse at the medical post for military headquarters for more than 34 years, and she earns 9,000 meticais per month.

He is married and has four children between 9 and 21 years old. He finished ninth grade and quit school because of financial problems. Horacio lives in his own house with his family and also supports two cousins who live with him.\n\nHe has never left Maputo. For more than 18 years he has worked in agriculture and has an income of 10,000 meticais per month. He uses the money for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\n\nHoracio has never had loans from other banks. He learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a customer, and this is his third Hluvuku loan. He is asking for 20,000 meticais, which he will invest in his agribusiness (agriculture) to buy seeds, compost, fertilizer and other items to increase his income. The first loans were for 11,000 meticais and 13,800 meticais, both for the agribusiness.\n\nHoracio dreams of buying a tractor to expand his business. To do so, he intends to ask Hluvuku for more loans.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":301.39,"image":{"id":856848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to invest in his agribusiness (agriculture) to buy seeds, compost, fertilizer and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Horacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2286.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232827448,"comment":null},{"amount":43.06,"local_amount":1111.11,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1143.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238639425,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2286.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250807572,"comment":null},{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2286.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263354240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-01T21:14:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":325864,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is from the village Gvara, Kobuleti District, Seaside of Georgia.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Due to his family situation he was not able to go to college after finishing (high) school. However, since he was little, his father and grandfather have been raising cattle and he has always helped them. Akbar has learned a lot from his family and is very knowledgeable in taking care of livestock. He has been taking care of his own herd for the last 4 years and his cattle sale business is doing well. The herd is also the sole source of income to support his own family and Akbar would like to take out a loan of 1000 US dollars to purchase more calves and expand his

She is married and has four children; three of them go to school. Florinda finished third grade and quit school because of financial problems. She lives in her own house with her family and supports her grandson, who lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe left Tete to move to Maputo in search of a job. Florinda receives a pension and has farmed for her family's consumption for 20 years. She has an income of 5,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses. She also saves some money in her bank account with the help of her pension.\r\n\r\nFlorinda has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a customer, and this is Florinda's second Hluvuku loan.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kurbon has a business selling women's clothes and children's shoes at the local market. In the past he has also sold office supplies: pens, pencils, notebooks and color paper for the school children.

the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She learned of Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client and this is her third loan from Hluvuku for the amount of 13,000 MZN, with which she intends to purchase products (peanuts, beverages, rice, beer and others) to increase her stock. Her previous loans were 9,600 MZN and 15,000 MZN and had the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe intends to expand her business in order to obtain more profits and for this she plans to solicit more loans from Hluvuku.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":346.57,"image":{"id":845645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase

She is married and has two children - the oldest is 28 years old and the youngest - 27. Her husband works as a master cabinet maker in the locale furniture factory. Larisa's older son is married and lives with his own family and the youngest son is working in Russia. Since 2002 Larisa has been managing her own business: she sells women's and men's shoes and clothes in a rented market stall at the Kapan's city market.

She has been working in this business for many years now, and thanks to God and her hard work, has managed to keep herself busy. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her business flourish, and become a place where many people can come and enjoy her delicious pupusas.  For this, she needs to buy a greater quantity of ingredients, to be able to have a larger supply, in order to meet and satisfy a larger demand.

She joined GHAPE in 2004 and has received and repaid Empowerment credit four times.\r\n\r\nShe plans to invest in her dressmaking and groundnut selling business.

Her loan will help the community in that it will enable her to make the cloths and groundnuts readily available for local buyers at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nShe will reinvest some of the proceeds realized from this business venture and use the rest to pay house rent, her children\u2019s school fees and to provide medication for her family.\r\n\r\nShe prefers a GHAPE loan because of the low interest rate, because no collateral security is required, because the money is repaid in installments and also because of the training GHAPE gives its members.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.
