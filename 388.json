She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). When she left school in 5th grade (a fundamental year in the Mali education system) she started to get interested in revenue-generating activities with her mother. Hawa opted for the preparation and sale of soft drinks, such as fruit juices. She enjoys a large customer base and a good reputation.\r\n\r\nIn order to make her juice she uses 2kg of sugar, six large sachets of juice powder and six sachets of valine sugar. All this is placed in a bucket of 15 litres of water.\r\n\r\nAs she needs to have new equipment in order to cope with customer demand, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. Having already had three group loans and two individual loans, all of which were repaid on time, she is now on her third individual loan, which will be used to buy a refrigerator locally in S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of men and women.

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and children in the Bagadadji district of the town of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). A matron by profession, she began trading when she was working in a municipality. When the women from this municipality wanted to organise a large festive ceremony, they sought her help. Since then and for the past ten years she has been carrying out her business and she now enjoys a large customer base and a good reputation. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her clothes. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of coping with an order from Niger, where her clothes are much appreciated, she has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. Having already had six group loans and two individual loans, all of which were repaid on time, she is now on her third individual loan. She is planning to use this to buy 15 pieces of \"pagnes wax\" (West African highly decorative and colourful fabric). She gets her supplies in Bamako and sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up exclusively of women. She envisages making a monthly profit of 140,000 FCFA which will allow her to pay for carpets and a freezer for her daughter who is getting married. \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to buy a house to live in.

Sauda\u2019s produce and wholesale business in 2003, somebody laid a bet that her business would not see the light of day after a month\u2019s course. The skepticism was a no-brainer to her, as she had set out her objectives to succeed by then. She had to bring her guts and determination to bear in the face of such low expectations from some of her disparaging friends.\r\n\r\nWith huge reserves of optimism and with a desire to prove her detractors wrong, 35-year-old Sauda embarked on her mission \u2013 to get established in the business genre of her preference, to wit: a produce sales and small commodity wholesale business. She went out of her depth to fight off the early financial quagmires that had reared their heads and were making her chances of success hang in the balance.\r\n\r\nSauda started getting into her stride when she began selling rice, groundnuts (peanuts), beans and millet. When her prospects began improving, her down-the-line attitude got even better. As a consequence, all her three children, who were hitherto not going to school, began attending school.\r\n\r\nSauda\u2019s customers are mostly small retailers. In a month, she says she earns to the tune of 600,000 shillings. She is also a counselor within her locality. With this loan she wants to buy some produce she has not sold before like coffee and cotton. She also wants to buy more matches, textbooks and tea leaves for her wholesale stock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":527519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops such as coffee that she has not sold before and also some wholesale stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sauda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salongo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salongo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yona","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abudu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Harriet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7750000,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734004,"comment":null},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767318,"comment":null},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662336,"comment":null},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T19:53:19Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194572,"name":"Jappo Liggey (Asf) N\u00b011 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Jappo Ligguey (asf)  est une association mixte compos\u00e9e de plusieurs personnes microentrepreuneuses.

It has been created in 2009 by a group of women who wanted to bring together all their peers in the district of Angle Serigne Fallou (ASF) under the slogan \u201cmutual aid for doing work.\u201d The group is lead by Mrs. Marie N. Diouf and is organized into multiple sub-groups of five, as advised by the agent of the Moda Kane credit union, so that all members could better benefit from U-IMCEC services. Thus several sub-groups have requested a loan of 500,000 West African francs, which will be divided equally among the members. Jappo Liggey # 11 is managed by Mrs. Penda C., who has been selling breakfast foods in front of the local school since 2002. She also sells jewelry, honey and palm oil. As regards her choice of trade, Mrs. Penda Cisokho says the following: \u201cI never had schooling in all my life, and when I wanted to find a useful occupation, commerce was something I could deal with as I kept an open mind and told myself that very often commerce is simply about networking, which was easy to do in the place where I live.\u201d And so with her part of the loan Mrs. C. would like to boost her budget for restocking.\r\n\r\nMrs. Aida T. is the treasurer. She has been selling breakfast and dinner foods in Grand Thi\u00e8s for six years. The other members are Mr. Thierno Nidaye, a street vendor selling onions, clothing, socks and shoes at different markets in Thi\u00e8s, Mrs. Khady Diagne M., who sells second-hand clothes and dinner foods in Randoul\u00e8ne Nord, a modest district of Thi\u00e8s, and Mrs. Aissanta D., who sells bowls, plates, fabrics and incense. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova,

She hopes to use the new profits from her business to reinvest back into her business.\r\n\r\nTo prepare her locally made palm oil, she gets her palm nuts from the farmers on the farm. She washes them and boils them for about 40 minutes until they become soft and tender. The cooked fruits are strained, put into a big mortar and gently squeezed with a pestle, avoiding damaging the nut but only to peel the pulp covering the nut. Water is then added to it. The juice obtained is strained, separating the nut and taking out the chaff with the hand. (The chaff is sometimes used by the local people to light charcoal fire). The juice is boiled again and as it boils, the fresh oil will be seen floating whilst the water keeps boiling beneath. The scooped oil is left to cool and later bottled or preserved for sale. Fresh oil from palm fruits are traditionally used in eating roasted yam or plantain in Africa, especially on the farms after a hard days work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":527552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a palm oil extractor to be able to extract more oil to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.283333 -1.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adjoa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":100,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-18T07:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":17.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136656145,"comment":null},{"amount":12.51,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-13T07:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":17.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144688763,"comment":null},{"amount":25.01,"local_amount":33.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":35.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872214,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":16.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-27T08:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":17.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612094,"comment":null},{"amount":12.48,"local_amount":16.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T10:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":17.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166826279,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-21T10:37:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-17T10:11:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194582,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 28-year-old single man living with his family in Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon.

He lives in Bambilor. He is married and the father of two children (one and four years of age). Mr. N. has been working in tailoring as well sewing  ready-to-wear clothing for more than ten years. After he had left school, his father sent him to study the tailoring trade. This is how he started his progress to the point where he is running two tailor shops. What interests him most is the creative aspect of this business, as well as the financial aspect permitting him to support himself and his family. He is borrowing 150,000 West African francs in order to purchase fabrics for sewing ready-to-wear clothing for sale. This credit will allow him to increase his revenues and better manage his everyday budget.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

He is 41 years old and dedicated to his business selling lunches and occasionally fast food.  His family consists of his wife and three children between the ages of 4 and 14, who are the reason why he strives in his work to get ahead.  This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he has requested the amount of 1,300,000 COP.  He plans to buy a table and ingredients for preparing lunches and fast food such as rice, oil, margarine, meat, chicken, cheese, sauces, and sausages.\r\n<p>\r\nAlirio is from the Department of C\u00f3rdoba, which is located to the north in the part of Colombia facing the Caribbean Sea.  This area is known for its swamps, livestock fairs, festivals (such as the one celebrating the donkey), pageants, and fertile soil.  Here he started his business five years ago selling soups and lunches.  He continues his business in Barranquilla and has since added fast food such as hot dogs, hamburgers, stuffed \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a>\u201d (corn bread), skewered meats, and kernelled corn.  Alirio has an assistant who help every day preparing lunches for his customers and on the weekends sells his famous hot dogs, hamburgers, and cold cuts.  Since he operates his business out of his home, his family is well-known in the community.  His main goal is to be well-organized, so he provides his customers plenty of chairs and tables to make them more comfortable.  Alirio prefers it this way because it allows him to provide better service to his paying customers.  His greatest challenge is not having enough capital to run his business with the necessary tools so that he can provide excellent service.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":525608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase a table & ingredients for preparing lunches and fast food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-04-22T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alirio Jos\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50335},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61314},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62592},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63896},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65227},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66586},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":67973},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69389},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":70835},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72310},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73817},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75355},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76925},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78527},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80163},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81833},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83538},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99385}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.29},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.03},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.14,"local_amount":50335,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51053.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895828,"comment":null},{"amount":31.83,"local_amount":61314,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":62188.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636156,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":62592,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63484.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850253,"comment":null},{"amount":584.53,"local_amount":1125759,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1141818.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T12:52:59Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194655,"name":"Hillary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hillary is a youth aged 26 married to a peasant wife and together they have three children aged 7, 2 and 1 years of age.

He has a domestic partner and three children. He lives in his own house, which is located in the Peruvian jungle in the Palmapampa community.\r\n\r\nWith vigorous effort and in spite of many obstacles that crossed his path, he focused on his goal to have his own farm dedicated to the production of cocoa and coffee. He usually works by himself, but during the harvest he hires some workers to help him with the work.  His regular working hours are from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm.  He sells his products at the community\u2019s collection centers and his prices vary according to the quantity he sells. This situation is not satisfactory for him, so he wants to open a store for farming products. Most of his clients are farmers in needs of products such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. for their farmland.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he is committed to making his payments on time.  He congratulates his communal bank for forming such a responsible group.  He will use this loan to maintain his farmland hoping to prevent any damage to his cocoa plantations. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rina Paguaga, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":527745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Cocoa plantation maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-22T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154031,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-22T12:37:51Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194690,"name":"Anh's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Anh T.

They live in Palmapampa, which is in the Peruvian jungle, and they have their own home.\r\n\r\nFor Mariza nothing is impossible. Her next goal is to make an addition on her grocery store. In order to reach this goal she is working constantly. This has helped her increase her sales over the course of several months. She thanks her father for her success because he gave her good advice when she left home and became independent. \r\n\r\nShe has extended her business hours over the last year and is now open from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM.

She resides in the beautiful Ayacuchana forest, located in the Palmapampa locality, where she has her own home.  She barely finished primary school due to her family's economic resources and the instability caused by terrorism in her area.  Years later, she was able to establish herself in her community.  She got married and had children, but she went through many years of turmoil and challenges before she successfully opened her grocery store.  Nowadays, she is happy with what she has accomplished.  Her experience taught her to visualize the opportunities when confronted with problems.  Well-established in her business, she hopes to expand her shop by obtaining new products but in larger bulks, in order to sell more at a cheaper price.  Her store is located in the same locality where she lives and on occasion she receives help from her children, whom are the reason for why she continues to work hard.

G. chose 12 years ago in order to have more free time to spend with her family.  She studied pastry and confectionery when she retired from a company in 2001 where she was a worker. She made pastries, cakes, small meat pies and catering for parties and banquets.  \r\n\r\nThat is her background and it's also what she does today in her store in the Los Angeles de Soledad neighbourhood, where she lives with her spouse. They have 3 children between the ages of 23 and 28.  They are all professionals now, thanks to the efforts and persistence of everyone in the household.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her 12th loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, and she is requesting $2.000.000.  She will add it to the money she has been saving since 2009, and buy an industrial mixer and a motorcycle to use for her deliveries.  Victoria says that since she invested in this organization, her business has changed due to the fact that with the injection of the new funds, she has been able to make a more diverse range of products, adapt them to the demands of the market, and positively impact it.  In so doing she has made new contacts, which has grown her business and increased her orders.  Her goal now is to formalize the business and continue to expand it because that is a great challenge.  \r\n\r\nVictoria is a very well known woman in her neighbourhood and she benefits from the environment of her community, whose festivities' patron saint is St. Pancracio.

She lives with her husband and 4 children in her own house.  For more than the past 10 years, she has worked raising guinea pigs.  The pen is installed in the patio of her house.  This is very profitable already as it does not require much capital expenditures as she has alfalfa fields that serve as fodder for the animals that she herself cares for and harvests alfalfa to feed them.  In this way she lives and has time to care for her children.  Each 15 days she sells her guinea pigs in large numbers, as many of her clients are commercial.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, she needs to get male guinea pigs to be stud animals in order to increase her production.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  She is very responsible with her repayments, and also considers that this contribution will be very useful in the progress of her business.  With the loan that she is asking for, she will invest in the purchase  of land next to her house so that she can install a larger guinea pig farm, by which she will be able to repay a part of the total cost, and the rest she will pay with her own funds.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":527766,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy land to raise more guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-22T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449312,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-23T16:50:59Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194708,"name":"Hanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Hanna A. is married to a taxi driver and lives with her four children.

Thanks to the help of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she has been able to build a house and improve the lives of her three children, who are currently between 26 and 30 years of age. She has had to do this alone, as she is the female head of the family.  Her greatest dream is to leave a business to each of her children so that they might not depend on her, and with this goal two of them are studying in SENA (a Colombian vocational college).<br

Another one of this dreams is to have aqueducts in 100% of his pens.  For John summer gives him his biggest challenges for his crops of yucca, corn and millet don't do well, and these are the main foods needed to fatten the animals.

Al momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo ella se siente entusiasmada porque desea ser autosuficiente por muchos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s y considera que este proyecto se lo permitir\u00e1.

This group is from the community of San Pablo Huantepec in the town of Jilotepec, State of Mexico, in Mexico.  The members of the group are photographed at Marisol\u2019s snow cone stand.  She started her natural snow cone business a year ago.  Marisol is requesting a loan to buy containers and ingredients that are needed to make her product.  She says that she currently has a limited supply of materials; therefore she only offers a few flavors.  With this loan she hopes to diversify her product and attract more customers.  However, she needs these items to maintain her business.  Her customers consist of travelers, which explains why her stand is located on the side of the road and constantly changes location since she looks for strategic areas where she can improve her sales.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Mar\u00eda de los Santos M. S. is Marisol\u2019s mother.  They have been working together making snow cones for three years.  Just like her daughter, Mar\u00eda started her working so that she could gain experience.  She now wants to start her own business and live independently because she believes there may come a time in the future when her children won\u2019t be able to support her financially.  Mar\u00eda thought it would be best to have her own small business so that she could save and build up some assets for when she is not able to work so that she and her husband can continue to live decently.  Upon applying for this loan, Mar\u00eda was very excited because she wants to be self-sufficient for many years to come and believes this project will help her do that.  She is 46 years old, married, and has four children (three daughters and a son).  Mar\u00eda has a sixth grade education.  She will use her loan to buy snow cone cups, ice chests, glasses, scoops, spoons, and raw materials needed to start her business.  She expects to generate income gradually so that she can save for a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nMaricela S. M. is the group president.  She is 22 years old, married, and has two daughters who are both 3 years old.  Maricela completed her education through the third year of high school.  She started a pizzeria a year ago.  Maricela is requesting a loan to buy a screened door for her business so that her shop stays clean.  She wants to provide her children with the opportunity to study.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group consists of 12 members.  This is the first time they have requested a loan from CrediCom\u00fan.  The other members are as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n- Sandra Saray P\u00e9rez H. (sells shoes through a catalog)\r\n- Rosa Ana C. Garc\u00eda (sells bedspeads through a catalog)\r\n- Lesli L. C.

This is why they chose her as the representative of the bank. \r\n\r\nAll of the bank members are very thankful to Emprender [the Kiva field partner] and to Kiva for the confidence shown in them by granting this loan.     \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":527807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristhian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio Cesar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18461.54,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1170.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1447.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1471.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1495.4},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1519.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1544.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1569.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1595.52},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1621.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1648.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1674.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1702.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.76},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194739,"name":"Charles Kimani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a 58-year-old farmer.

She has three daughters, one of whom lives near her and currently helps with her business.  Rosa has been earning her own income by farming, raising animals, and selling products for human consumption for more than 15 years.  Her daughter, who is married and independent, later joined her in her business venture.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the mornings, Rosa leaves for the fields so that she can survey her farmland.  What she is able to harvest she sells either at her store or to wholesalers in the city.  At the same time, she also takes her cows and sheep to the open spaces where they can graze on fresh grass that keeps them healthy and vigorous prior to being sold.

He has been farming for 10 years now and this has enabled him to feed, clothe and provide shelter for his family since his wife is a housewife.\r\n\r\nDaniel was introduced to KADET by a KADET client and this will be his first loan with KADET, a Kiva partner. He is planning to use the entire loan on his farm by buying three bags of fertilizer worth 7,500 Kenyan shillings and maize seedlings worth Kshs 2,750. He will use the rest for plowing.\r\n\r\nDaniel is also a mason in addition to farming.

They live together in their own home.  Elena has been selling athletic shoes upon request for four years.  Her work involves offering different designs and brands of athletic shoes through a catalog to potential customers based on their personal tastes and delivering the merchandise to those who decide to order them.  Elena enjoys her work greatly because it gives her freedom.  She usually offers her products in the morning and then collects payments in the afternoon from people who have already received their merchandise, since she extends credit to some of her customers.  Her husband Sa\u00fal Jos\u00e9 is also in the same line of work selling athletic shoes, except he is employed by a company.  In the future, both of them want to open a large vending post at one of the busiest markets in the area where they live.\r\n<p>\r\nElena is a long-time client of MFP and has demonstrated great responsibility with her payments throughout this period.

She lives in the Cumbe parish locality, filled with natural rural scenes that offer spiritual peace, far from the bustle of great cities.  Its people are kind and warm with the tourist, no matter your origin.  Here most adults, including women, dedicate themselves to cultivating the earth, while most young people have migrated in search of a better future.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Guillermina is 58 years old, married, and has produced 7 children, 3 of whom are married.  Two of these live independently while the 3rd shares the parent's roof and helps with household expenses, as do the remaining 3 single brothers as well. Besides providing for expenses they also help with university costs for their younger brother.  Mar\u00eda's husband has his own brass works shop, and despite everyone's efforts, they still can't count on their own home \u2013 they live in a rental house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has worked with her communal bank for 12 years, maintaining excellent links with her fellow members.  She sells meals at the cattle market each Wednesday, as well as on weekends in the center of Cumbe.  The remaining days she sells coffee with tamales on the streets of her community.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting, she will buy pots, tableware, plates, as well as rice, sugar, salt, and other products necessary for preparing these meals.  Her goal is to finally have her own house in the future not too far off.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":527713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"BUYING POTS, TABLEWARE, PLATES, RICE, SUGAR, SALT, ETC., FOR SELLING MEALS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mar\u00eda Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674864,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709056,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892355,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632720,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846760,"comment":null},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":183.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113283,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-27T21:22:20Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194774,"name":"Cruz Del Pilar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nDo\u00f1a Cruz del Pilar es una mujer activa, de edad de 55 a\u00f1os, durantes estos a\u00f1os logro tener su propio negocio, una sastrer\u00eda el cual aprendi\u00f3 el oficio junto a su esposo ya que era sastre.

When you take care of them from infancy, you are living all their first experiences with them. Some that are now grown still come to visit me.\u201d \r\n\r\nAna\u2019s own children are also grown. Her son lives nearby and helped her to make a website for her business, but her daughter and other relatives live in Peru.  Ana loves that she is able to visit her family each year for the holidays. Before opening her daycare she held a number of jobs, and her schedule was determined by the needs of her bosses rather than her own. \r\n\r\nShe began taking Child Development classes and discovered that it was something she not only was passionate about, but also could turn into a profession. After receiving her certification as a childcare provider, she established her in-home daycare business in 2004. \u201cEvery child has their own history and needs help to come out of their shell. Every day I can hug and pay each one special attention. Preschools are bigger, and they just don\u2019t have the capacity to provide such close care.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis will be Ana\u2019s third loan from Opportunity Fund since 2007.  The financing has helped her to install new recreational equipment, including a swing set in her back yard, and to hire an employee to help her with the children. With an $8,000 loan, Ana will continue to make safety improvements to her facility and upgrade the education materials she uses each day.

D. M. is 49 years old.  She lives in the Department of San Vincente, where she lives together with her husband, who works as a businessman, and her two children who are 20 and 15 years old.  Her children are studying.  Guadalupe has a business selling basic grains, disposable plates and silverware, coffee, and many types of basic household goods.  She sells these in her stall, which is located in the municipal market in San Vincente, both wholesale and individually.  This business provides the large part of the household income and allows her to maintain stability.  It is for this reason that she is asking for a loan, with which she would be able to buy larger quantities of merchandise and in this manner achieve larger profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

As a matter of fact, she joined ASHI in 2008 wanting to partner with her fisherman son to grow his business. The loans she has been requesting and is requesting now is her source of capital to achieve the desire of her heart. \r\n\r\nDespite her old age, Enriquita is still capable of selling the fish caught by her son to people around their village. The profits she earns provide her family with simple things they really enjoy; though for Enriquita, those things they have may not be enough. Her sons still have some desires for their lives kept in their hearts, yet she has never heard them complain about the kind of life they have. Through ASHI, Enriquita hopes that one day her business will flourish and bring improvements in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":527990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a

M. is from the village of Antipolo. She is 28 years old. Charlyn is married and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Charlyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Charlyn has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Charlyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional construction materials for house improvements. Charlyn is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used for house completion. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Charlyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

from being poor, Rosalia M., all by herself, faces the challenges of supporting the needs of her only child who is studying in college until she graduates. Her husband, who works abroad hoping to improve their lives by providing her enough financial support, left her for another woman. Despite that painful event in Rosalia\u2019s life, she has never thought of giving up her dream for her child. Instead she became tough and determined to face challenges in achieving her goal. \r\n\r\nRosalia had started her own small variety store in 2008, financed by a loan through Kiva's field partner, ASHI. Since then she has her own source of income for supporting her needs, and most especially her child\u2019s. Though sustainability has been a challenge for her because income is not yet liquid for supporting her family\u2019s entire needs, Rosalia still clings to her dream of making her store profitable and successful. Because of that, she is now requesting a much larger loan through ASHI. \r\n\r\nAlthough Rosalia fails in her love life, she still has a lot of things to feel fortunate about in her life. She enjoys her career as a business woman and being a mother to her only daughter, Louela Jean.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":528021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

To make a living, Nena owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.

Nena has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nena is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.

P. is from the village of Taguitic, Kapatagan, Lanao Del Norte. She is 44 years old. Eudesa is married and has 1 adult child. To make a living, Eudesa owns & operates a manufacturing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing & selling bamboo items and also weaving mats for 'nipa' (palm frond) huts. She also sells them to local community members. Eudesa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eudesa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eudesa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Eudesa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This will be the second loan taken out by Eudesa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

This loan of 15,000 Php is to help her buy fishing nets to increase her stock to match her customers\u2019 demands in the local community.\r\n\r\nTeresita thinks that commercializing her business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and enable her to pay school fees for her children and cater for other family needs. With access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete college degrees will be achieved.\r\n\r\nTeresita\u2019s

Nh\u01b0 is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Th\u00f4n nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\nNh\u01b0 is married and has 1 infant child.  To make a living, Nh\u01b0 owns & operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Nh\u01b0 has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nh\u01b0 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 5.152.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Nh\u01b0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Dilorom tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. Dilorom has requested a loan of $1500 USD to increase her product inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gulbahor is an enterprising woman with a big desire to improve the quality of life for her family. She is married and has 4 children. Twenty years ago, Gulbahor started offering her services as a seamstress to her neighbors and acquaintances. She began this business because she did not have a job and she needed to find an activity to help her husband with family expenses. Gulbahor works in a tailoring shop where she produces national dresses for women. Now all of her children are going to school. She wishes for her children to continue with their education. That is the reason that she needs to continue growing her business. Gulbahor asks for a loan of 4500 Somoni that will be invested in buying supplies to increase her production and to cover her customers' demands. Help this family with improving their quality of life by contributing to the growth of Gulbahor\u2019s business. They will sincerely thank you for it.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Gulmurod is 55 years old. He is married and has three children. Gulmurod is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the raising large livestock and their sale at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises the heifers with the help of his wife and young son. He then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Today, Gulmurod is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $1200 USD in his business. In order to receive this amount, Gulmurod has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.    \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and he will also make some investments.  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and children in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Having never been to school and coming from a family of traders, she began her revenue generating activities at an early age with her mother, who sold clothes and shoes. After several years as an apprentice with her mother, she understood and was able to assimilate the mechanics of the business, which she has now been running alone for ten years. She enjoys a large customer base and a good reputation.\r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her business in order to meet customer demand, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has had relations with this institution for the past 60 months. After four group loans and three individual loans, all of which have been repaid on time, she is on her fourth individual loan. She is planning on using this loan to buy ten pieces of \"pagnes-wax\" (highly decorative and colourful West African fabric), five pieces of embroidered \"pagnes\" and two pieces of rich damask fabric. She gets her supplies locally from wholesalers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Assan H. sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women and men. She envisages making a monthly profit of 60,000FCFA, which will allow her to consolidate her business. Her ambition is to build a house to live in. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":528243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-23T07:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779221,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961425,"comment":null},{"amount":56.81,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699543,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913441,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180614,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476587,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613371,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751850,"comment":null},{"amount":56.81,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606087,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917746,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":27775.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T05:09:07Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":194963,"name":"United Family Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wesseh T. is the leader of a group of five borrowers called United Family.

She made it through seventh grade. She buys bananas to make wine with and then sells the wine in the suburbs of  Kanyosha. This is the business she has always done well at, even before she got a loan through Turame. \r\n\r\nMonique is the mother of seven children, four girls and three boys, and five of them are married, whereas two others attend secondary school. She struggles so that her children will be able to attend school and graduate with success, but also so that each will be able to have his own house in town and live comfortably. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the Kiva loan to buy more bananas and produce more wine to sell to her customers. She hopes that this increase in working capital will lead to a lot more profit. That way, she will be able to resolve certain of her difficulties with daily expenses and paying school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nShe is one of the members of the \u00ab VUGUKURI  \u00bb group;
