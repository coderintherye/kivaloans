G. is 50 years old and married to Vicente G. who is presently managing the boarding house that they own. The couple is blessed with 2 children who have already graduated from college.  The older, 28 years old, is a teacher while the younger is 26 years old and works with the  Coastguard. The family lives in the village of Sitio Serena, Brgy Enclaro, Binalbagan Negros Occidental. <P>\r\n\r\nIt was always Amalia's dream to be able to send her children to school so they would have their own jobs, and to help her husband pay for their household expenses -- and she has done all this with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon.<P>\r\n\r\nAmalia joined NWTF-PD in January 1995 and used the first cycle loan to start a general or \"sari-sari\" store. Since it was in a good location, she was able to earn a good income, and she used her subsequent loans to continue improving the operations of her general store. Later, they started taking in boarders, and her husband took care of managing the boarding house. She was able to earn a net monthly income of PHP 6,000 from her businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the help of her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, plus her own efforts and the support of her family, she was able to send her 2 children to school until they finished their college education, a fulfillment of one of her most cherished dreams. She has also acquired a few productive assets such as a refrigerator for her general store, and she had electricity and water pumps installed in her boarding house. <P>\r\n\r\nNow Amalia is helping some members of her extended family by supporting the education of her nephew, paying tuition and providing him with an allowance so that he will have some spending money while in school. <P>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Amalia borrowed Php 19,500 which she used as additional working capital, using part of the income to support her nephew's education. Now she is borrowing for her 14th loan the amount of PHP 23,000, again as additional capital for her general store. She intends to use the income to continue supporting not only her immediate family but she hopes to also improve the lives of other relatives so that they too will achieve their potential just like her own children. This is her way of practicing being \"Dungganon\" (honorable)<P>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: <P>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but of thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":409864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives with her mother, two sisters, and her 25 year old son who works and supports her.  For a year, together with her son, she has rented a space next to her home where she has begun a business selling office supplies and operating an internet caf\u00e9.  Llerme decided to go into this business because in the area where she lives there are several law and accounting offices, and the people who work there are her principal customers.  This is not her only work, however.  She also works in an ice cream parlor, serving the public for 11 years.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it is located near her house.  In addition, she likes giving good service to her customers and having pleasant conversations with them.  Furthermore, she considers her activities profitable because the first is her own business that provides her with daily income, and in the ice cream parlor she obtains secure pay on a monthly basis.  In the future, Llerme hopes to have a clothing shop.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she is pleased with her communal bank because they don\u2019t have problems.  They work well and are responsible with their payments.  With the money that she is now applying for she will buy more office supplies in order to increase the stock of her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":410133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase of inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T15:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Llerme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":226.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":234.02},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":243.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":255.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":275.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.34,"local_amount":226.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":228.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843064,"comment":null},{"amount":161.25,"local_amount":460.7,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":463.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734641,"comment":null},{"amount":5.95,"local_amount":17.02,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124047,"comment":null},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":255.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":257.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959724,"comment":null},{"amount":92.52,"local_amount":264.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":266.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992571,"comment":null},{"amount":96.36,"local_amount":275.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T22:53:18Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":145862,"name":"Ebenezer 1 & 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is the coordinator of her group Ebenezer and her story is representative of both the members of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated from the DR to Haiti)  more generally.

On average, they are 39 years old and have three children. They live in the neighborhood of Bozo in the city of Diamarabougou Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The group members know each other through professional or family links; they are members of the same traditional association of women from Bozo, which has existed for over ten years. They have repaid without difficulty their previous four group loans and are now applying for their fifth group loan with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<p>\r\nThey will use this loan to buy 12 boxes of smoked fish and 800 kg of fresh fish. The fish will be sorted and then either sold fresh or fried, smoked or dried. They get their supply of smoked fish in Macina (Mignon and Diado) and of fresh fish on location in Markala on the banks of the River Niger, near the bridge, in the fishery zones of Markala and in Niono (Dora). The fish, whether fresh, fried, smoked or dried, will be sold in Bamako, at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and on location in Markala, for cash and seldom on credit, to a clientele made up of women and men. They have at their disposal in their backyards traditional specialized ovens and dryers to smoke and dry their fish.\r\n<p>\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 83,500 CFA francs (US$191). They will save this money to buy freezers, to help their husbands to buy fishery material, to take part in social events (baptisms, weddings and funerals) and to pay small household expenses, in particular soap and clothing. Their ambition is to buy, each of them, a freezer to bring down their expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":410163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pah          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosso                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabiata                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873761,"comment":null},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763483,"comment":null},{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152299,"comment":null},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991153,"comment":null},{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021420,"comment":null},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746223,"comment":null},{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778819,"comment":null},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":93750,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94412.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961079,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T16:48:53Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":145873,"name":"Be Strong Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"'Be Strong' is a group of 5 borrowers led by Gayduo K., 38 years old, a widow  with 3 children aged 5 -12 years old.

He lives alone in a rented room, and what he wishes for the most is to live out his old age peacefully.\r\n\r\nBecause of his high quality workmanship and reasonable prices, Leoncio\u2019s carpentry business is one of the busiest in the city of Juliaca.  He decided to go into woodworking as a youngster, to make items that people can utilize.  This drove him to learn how to be one of the most well-known carpenters in the city.  What he enjoys most about his work is transforming a piece of raw wood, and he has been in this line of work for 20 years.  He considers one of the most difficult aspects of his business the carrying of heavy large pieces of wood, since he is not as strong as he once was.\r\n\r\nFor the future of his business, he would like to buy new machinery to compete with other larger carpentry workshops.  This is Leoncio\u2019s second loan with MFP, and he is committed to making all his payments on time since he doesn\u2019t want to create any problems for the other members of the cooperative bank where he is well-liked.

She saved a little of the money her husband gave her for groceries and used it to prepare and sell ceviche, chicha and fruit from her yard.  These sales would generate small profits that she used to supplement her husband's income thereby contributing to household expenses.  A year later her husband and herself decided to use their savings to sell groceries so, together with the loans Violeta got, they set up a well-stocked grocery store.  Unfortunately, she had to abandon this activity because the owner of the vending stall she used decided not to renew her rental contract, apparently due to the success Violeta was having.  This was not a barrier to continue working, however.  The first thing she did was improve a small part of her little house to sell her merchandise there.  She also managed supply meals to the employees of a firm which was located near her home for a few months.

Her business is doing well due to a steady clientele that orders embroidered skirts and blouses (a native clothing of Cuenca). Rose also raises chickens, guinea pigs, sheep, pigs and cattle, and sells the animals in her community.\r\n <p>\r\nRosa has spent four years working with the loan foundation and says that the new loan that you submit to the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir will be invested in buying materials to build a house for her son.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa's goal is also to buy a car for her son who works and studies in Cuenca so he can get home at night.\r\n<p>\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Dolores C. is another member of the Saint Vincent community bank. She is 39 years old and married with four children ages 12, 14, 16, and 19. Her eldest daughter is a knitting aid, the second works in a carpentry workshop, the third son helps with the care of the family's animals at home, and the youngest son is studying in school in Portete del Victoria. The family lives in a house that was built by Mar\u00eda's husband, who works in construction.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda works in the family business and has fourteen years of embroidery experience. She tells us that she has a steady clientele that brings work to her home and that she is also engaged in raising and selling livestock, such as chickens and guinea pigs, and selling milk obtained from cattle dairy delivery trucks. The family's animals are for consumption and for sale at Cuenca's open air market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's fourth loan working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir. She will use her livestock to obtain new loans that she will invest in the purchase of grass for her livestock. Because of drought, there is not enough grass for nutrition. The money will also be used to cover some costs of their home.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda's goal is to a build a new home and buy a car. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Bryce Holland, Kiva

Along with her children, she makes clothing for young girls \u2013 dresses, shirts, nightgowns, and anything else that the customer requests.  She manages the shop with much enthusiasm and energy, despite suffering from a leg impairment.  She hires seasonal help for the embroidery of the garments, especially at the end of the year when she has the most requests and sends her garments abroad.  Juan Sebastian Curiti is her right-hand man since he sews the garments in the industrial sewing machines with agility.

B. is from the village of Danao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Dioso has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dioso joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dioso has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. Dioso is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Dioso from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<P>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Altyngul solidly stands on her feet and intends to continue developing her business further.  Currently, Altyngul needs a loan, which would enable her to purchase a new stock of bedding.  She wants to buy a new selection of bedding sets because it will help increase goods turnover and attract a larger quantity of customers.  According to Altyngul, she is doing all this in order to provide her daughter with higher education.  She dreams of opening another business location and grow her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAltyngul has partners in this group:\r\n<p>\r\nMeerim is twenty-three years old.

E. is from the village of Lacapp, Acad Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur in the Philippines.  He is 37 years old, married, and has 7 school-age children.  To make a living, Quirwin owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector.  Specifically, he buys and sells \"uling\" charcoal to local community members.  Quirwin has been engaged in this business for over 3 years, and he earns approximately 10,000 PHP per month from these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Quirwin joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services and to thereby improve his living situation as well as his ability to engage in business activities.  Notably, Quirwin has already successfully repaid a prior loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.  Quirwin is now requesting a second loan from GDMPC in the amount of 6,000 PHP ($150), which will be used to expand the business.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of this loan to improve his family's general living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

J. T. is a 45-year-old married man from the village of Bliss, Aurora Zamboanga del Sur, in the Philippines.  He has 4 school-age children. To earn a living, Uldarico owns and operates a business venture in the food sector.  Specifically, he runs a \"carenderia\" -- i.e., a mini restaurant.  At the carenderia, his income is primarily derived from serving a variety of different meals to customers from his local community.  Uldarico has been engaged in this business for over 2 years, and he earns approximately 5,500 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Uldarico joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services and to thereby help improve his living situation as well as his ability to engage in business activities.  Notably, Uldarico has already successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC in the amount of 20,000 PHP, which was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.  Uldarico is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 20,000 PHP ($450), which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the mini restaurant.  This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Uldarico from GDMPC.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated as a result of this loan to improve and expand his business and to pay for his children's school tuition. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.  It has four branches and three unit offices, covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental.  Its membership is mostly comprised of farmers, fishermen, and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":410456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Burulcha raised three children.  Right now, her oldest daughter is twenty-seven years old.  She works overseas in Dubai.  The middle son is twenty-five.  He works in Kyrgyzstan and lives separately.  The youngest, twenty-one-year-old daughter lives with the older sister in Dubai.  Despite her age, Burulcha is actively involved in increasing livestock headcount, and thus can provide herself with all the necessities.   Two years ago, her daughter sent her money in the sum of six thousand som, and Burulcha was able to purchase livestock.   She liked breeding livestock so much that she fully devoted herself to this entrepreneurship.  With time, Burulcha could increase livestock headcount, having sold which, she decided to give her son a car right away.  Currently, she keeps a cow and a bull for her domestic needs and is also involved in increasing headcount of cattle.  Burulcha sees a wide spectrum of opportunities in this business because the environment in Kyrgyzstan is very conducive to breeding livestock.  This is precisely the reason why Burulcha decided to request a loan in order to purchase bulls and send them to a village, where her mother lives.  After raising livestock there for half a year, Burulcha would want to sell all of the purchased livestock and buy soft furniture for home.  Burulcha\u2019s plans also include varying her entrepreneurial activity and opening a tire vulcanization shop, where her son would work.  In the future, Burulcha also wants to build a big house for herself and her son.  For this, she is ready to sacrifice her time and effort.\r\n<p>\r\nAlong with Burulcha, this group includes Guliya, Gulnara and Myskal.\r\nGuliya is fifty-seven.  Her husband and she are retired.  Their children are grown and live separately.  Together with her husband, Guliya keep cows and have been involved in small-scale pastoral farming.  They were able to increase livestock headcount and build a house.  Guliya needs a loan in order to buy more livestock to increase headcount.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara is a mother of five children.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Gulnara is involved in animal husbandry.  Her husband provided Gulnara with the starting capital and helped her in other ways in her new business.  Gulnara is happy with her business and requested a loan in order to purchase a cow and then sell milk.\r\n<p>\r\nMyskal is forty-five.  She is a widow and a mother of three children.  Myskal makes a living from animal husbandry.  She decided to get involved in this business on her own.  None of her children help her with the business.  Myskal decided to request a loan in order to purchase a bull, raise it and then sell it.         \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

D. is from the village of Pwerta, Lurugan Valencia City. She is 33 years old. Margie is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Margie owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, operating a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal products such as bags and some clothing wear in the local community. Margie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Margie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Margie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. Margie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Margie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<p>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Militar, Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 28 years old. Jerlyn is married and has two young children. To make a living, Jerlyn operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) retail store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Jerlyn has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jerlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jerlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jerlyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Jerlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":410449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables. T. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, T. joined SEDA in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.142.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. T. is now requesting a new loan of 4.142.000 VND, which will also be used to expand the business. The loan will be her 8th loan from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA: \r\n\r\nSEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) provides microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nT.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is from the village of Purok 4, Valencia City.

Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luzviminda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her food products. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Luzviminda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Habib is a 47-year-old farmer, who lives with his wife and three children in the Northern part of Tajikistan, in Spitamen. Habib has two milk cows and sells dairy products to the local traders. He has five years of experience in raising cattle and selling dairy products. Habib's dairy products are in very high demand in his village; however the milk from two cows is not enough to meet demand. Habib is therefore applying for a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase an additional cow and fodder. Habib is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his standard of living through this loan.\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p.\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

H. is from the village of Bangko, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 54 years-old and married with eleven adult children.  Mila owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling coconut branch wood related products in the local community. Mila has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Mila joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand the business. Mila is requesting a fourth loan of 2,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated  to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb (10102110027) is a 28 year-old woman living in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, D. works in a family member's business providing construction services to local community members.  D. has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000,000 Vietnamese dong (about $224 US) a month from these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2006, D. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business.  D. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,142,000 dong from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to expand the business.  D. is now requesting a new loan of 5,014,000 dong which will be used to expand the business.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  D. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n<P>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n<P>\r\nD.

Th\u1ecb (10114140003) is a 38 year-old woman living in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.  Nhung is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Tu\u00e2n L\u1ec1 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\nNhung is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, Nhung operates a family member's business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  While not the only sales, the daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste are the largest selling items to the surrounding community.  Nhung has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 2.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Nhung joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Nhung has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.724.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.758.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Nhung plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

She is 51 years old, married and the mother of six children, aged 11, 16, 20, 28, 29 and 31 years.  Of these, the three youngest go to school.  She got her grade eight and was unable to continue with her studies due to financial conditions.  She lives in her own house with her family and two of her husband's relatives.\r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane in 1980 with her husband to look for work.  She lived in a rented house after getting married.  She began construction work on her own house (which is still under construction) where she presently lives with her family in the district of Boane.\r\n\r\nShe has been a businesswoman for 14 years.  She learned to do this with friends from the neighbourhood where she lives.  She has no employees.  Each month she manages to get an income of about 15,000 MT.  From this amount she manages to save some with her friends through a traditional savings system (Xitique).\r\n\r\nShe has never worked with other credit institutions.  She got to know about Hluvuku through Mr. Francisco Zandamela, one of the clients of this institution.  This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 20,000 MT, with which she plans to buy sand, stone, cement and other items.  The previous loans were for 10,000 MT, 15,000 MT and 20,000 MT, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to ask for more loans from this institution in order to finish her construction work and purchase furniture for the house.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

He has a maid, and sometimes is able to save around 2.000.00MT per month.\r\n\r\nNarciso had already requested a loan from the BIM commercial bank for the amount of 29.000.00MT to begin construction on his home.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are clients and after an analysis, decided to take out loans through Hluvuku.  This 25.000.000MT loan is his third with Hluvuku, and will be used to purchase doors, cement, stones, sand, etc.  The previous loans were for 15.000.00MT, 20.000.00MT and 35.000.00MT, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to take out more loans to complete his home and to purchase a car, as a way to provide more comfort and convenience to his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

She did this to augment the meager income from the operation of their motorized tricycle.  She now earns close to P14,000 a month, especially during peak months nearing the Christmas season.  From her profits, she was able to purchase a brand new washing machine for the family and she was able to renovate their kitchen sink.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She is applying for a loan in the amount of P12,000 so she can purchase more items to sell.  \r\n\r\nShe is working hard to help her husband cover their basic daily needs.

Her oldest son is now 31 years old and youngest daughter is only nine. Nurbubu and her husband are farmers. They breed small cattle in specialized sheds for keeping cattle which are known as \"kashars.\" Their kashar is in the suburb of Balykchi. Nurbubu is happy that she has grown so many children. Because all of them are actively helping their parents and by that contribute to their family business. They started with just keeping the cattle at their home. In a short period of time they managed to increase the headcount of cattle and they soon need a large space which they successfully found. Animal husbandry has become a golden niche for Nurbubu because thanks to this business Nurbubu and her husband have significantly improved their quality of life. Firstly, they have married their son without any difficulties, celebrated his wedding and bought him a car. All the expenses were covered by the profit made from selling cattle. Nurbubu is fifty two years old, but even now she works very hard every day and gives her soul to the growth of their business. Their starting capital included around fifteen thousand soms. Right now they can already make the third of this amount in one month. Nurbubu has decided to ask for a loan with the purpose to buy fodder for the winter time. This will allow her to successfully feed the cattle until the spring. Nurbubu very much wants to pay off the kashar in the next two years. She is ready to do everything she can to achieve it. \r\n\r\nNurbubu's group partners are: Abdykadyr, Aigul, Bermetkan and Anara.\r\n\r\nAbdykadyr is sixty six years old. He is married and is a father of two children. To feed the family he breeds small cattle in the kashar. Abdykadyr needs a loan to prepare the fodder for the winter.\r\n\r\nAigul is forty eight years old. She is a mother of two children. Aigul is a housewife. Her husband transports and sells coal. He also works as a driver on the glass factory every fifteen days. Aigul needs a loan to pay her daughter's college tuition.\r\n\r\nBermetkan is forty nine years old. She is has an only daughter. Bermetkan breeds small cattle and her husband works in construction. With the help of the loan Bermetkan plans to buy fodder for the cattle for the winter.\r\n\r\nAnara is forty years old. Four years ago Anara decided to start a business. She started selling gum, seeds, nuts and tobacco products. Her husband is already involved in her business. Anara needs a loan to increase her circulation of merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

When she is asked how it was that she got into this kind of business, she relates that her husband is a mechanic and many of his customers who would come in for repairs often wanted to buy new motors or better models of the ones they currently owned.  So, she decided to sell motors and, not only that, but replacement part, too.  She remembers that with her first loan she purchased piston rings.  With time, her husband got a new job so she could no longer count on his expertise in the motor buying and selling business so she began a new enterprise:  the sale of tennis shoes which she sells at the 16 of July Fair (Market) in the city of El Alto.  It is for this new activity that she needs this new loan.  Like Julia, her partners have different and varied activities such as the sale of salchipapa (a dish made of potatoes and fried sausage), transportation services and skirt making.<br

A laborer earns a very small salary and is sometimes not enough to sustain the family's needs especially with five children.  Four of their children are adults and one is still attending school. Rosendo also receives a small pension because he is over 60, but continues to work in the sugarcane plantation to earn a living. Virginia dreams to be able to pull her family out of their current situation, and is doing her utmost to earn more.\r\n \r\nSeveral years ago, Virginia was looking for a good opportunity to help her husband, and then decided to start her own business. In 2002 she was able to become a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and borrow enough capital for her proposed business, for a general store. She was able to earn a good income that helped in defraying household expenses. Sadly, the general store was in trouble and she had to shut it down. But she was able to borrow enough capital to open a computer gaming shop which was very popular among the youth. The two computer workstations earn her an average of PHP 2,500 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan she borrowed PHP 8,000 to do some maintenance work on her equipment and for additional working capital. She fully paid her loan on time and in full without any delays. And now for her 14th cycle she is borrowing Php 10,000 that she intends to use to buy an additional computer box and as start-up capital for a mini grocery store, and \"batchoyan\" (an eatery that sells the ilonggo noodle dish). In the picture Virginia in shown posing in front of her computer gaming place.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Renato is the 5th child of twelve siblings and he is taking care of his mother.\r\n\r\nTo support his parents and prepare for his future, Renato engaged in a pig-fattening business, and he has two productive sows today. All the piglets of the two sows were sold and the income he obtained was used to buy additional pig feed and even vitamins for the sows. It was also used to help support his family expenses, and most especially his mother.\r\n\r\nRenato found out that he needed additional capital to expand his business and to support the needs of his business. In 2004 he became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and was able to obtain a loan for his business needs. His business improved because of the loan and he was able to add more piglets to raise and sell. And, as the amount he could borrow increased because of his good credit record, he was able to improve his business facilities and was able to earn PHP 4,000 per month, which was enough to sustain his business, support himself and his mother, and set aside some amount for his future family.\r\n\r\nFor his previous loan, Renato borrowed Php 14,000 which he used as additional working capital for his business. The said loan amount was repaid in weekly installments and was fully repaid on time and without any delays. That\u2019s why he is planning for his 10th loan to borrow the same amount. It will be used to purchase additional livestock to raise and to sell and whatever income arises from it will be used to improve and expand his business even further.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.
