T. is a widow who lives in Ruiz Street, Brgy. Libacao, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 businesses:  pig fattening and e-loading. Mercedes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercedes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th  loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to pay for more pigs so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Mercedes T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Tinago, Brgy. Doong, Bantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her seaweed culture, fishing and dried fish businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. \r\n\r\n<p>Rucelinda is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and seaweed equipment.  This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its  term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Rucelinda hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This loan will be a great help for making their dreams come true and little by little her business selling of spare parts will become a full shop soon. For six years as a member of ASHI she has been trusted with loans that have improved their standard of living. Elma is also a good mother and a good adviser. Even at this young age she motivates her children to finish their studies through college because education is the only thing she can give that other people can\u2019t steal.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that through her loans from ASHI in partnership with KIVA; someday she will be able to save money for their future. Along with the business success she is dreaming about is the hope to see the graduation of her children through college with degrees and to see them find a steady job.

Her husband Mario V., who is 40 years old, works as a laborer in Hacienda to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nBernadina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bernadina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 16,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for electronic reloading and charcoal, so that she could continue to save up for future to send her children to school and expand the business. Photo was taken during the center meeting. Bernadina V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Sitio Buragwak, Brgy. Manghanoy, La Castellana, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, arucera (rice mill), and buy and sell businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,500.\r\n\r\nRachel is now borrowing PHP 49,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 40,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rachel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is Nena P., 32, resident of Commonwealth, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Angel P., and mother of three children, two of whom are enrolled in elementary while the oldest child is in high school. By the grace of God, Nena has managed to support her older child's schooling up to high school level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send them all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Juanita, as she herself has been a college undergraduate, and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNena operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNena dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":590854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

L. is from the town of Sto. Ni\u00f1o. She is 41 years old. Diana is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Diana owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Diana has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 50,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Diana joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Diana has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Diana is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Diana from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

portions of the loan for different purposes.  \r\n\r\nThe members  have selected Mrs. Norn C. as the village bank president. Mrs. Norn C. is 50 years old and a widow with a child who is a seamstress in a garment factory. She works as a farming laborer and she is also a pig breeder who can earn large amounts of money to support her family.

D. is a resident of Kant, a small pleasant city near Bishkek. Chynara is 46 years old and she is married. She has two sons and a daughter. The daughter studies at school and the sons sell household appliances in a pavilion. Four years ago, Chynara started to sew blankets and sell them to make money. She started with the initial investment of 3000 soms. She also sells curtains, and in this way she makes 15,000 soms per month. That profit made it possible for her to start repairing her house and purchase a vehicle. \r\n\r\nChynara applied for the loan because she needs money to purchase fabrics and materials for sewing curtains.

She is married to June G., a security guard, and mother to an elementary school-aged child. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college--a dream for most Filipino parents like Ma. Mernaly as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMa. Mernaly operates a rug-making business and at the same time is a fabric dealer. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMa. Mernally dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B., is married and has three children: Karla, 9; Erick, 7; and Yuliana, 5. Two of the kids are in primary school and the youngest is in preschool.  Carmen embroiders napkins.  She will invest her loan in supplies, including calico cloth and thread so she can keep making napkins.\r\n\r\nCarmen decided on this business because she had learned how to make napkins from her mother when she was a child, and because it\u2019s a way to gain success for her children so they can have a better life and want for nothing.  She can also help her husband out with household expenses and the education of their children.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very pleased because, she says, business is going well.  She is enjoying a great deal of success selling her napkins, since they are handmade and attract a lot of attention, mostly from the tourists, who are her best clients.  Sales have gone up quite a bit and her income has improved considerably.\r\n\r\nThe members, Carmen tells us, are very hardworking people who want to succeed and fight for a better future for their families.  Above all, they are responsible with respect to their obligations, which she can say because she has known them for a long time and knows that they won\u2019t fail in their ventures.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very grateful to the Kiva donors for the help they\u2019re providing.  Thanks to their support she has been able to maintain and better her business, increase profits, and help her family improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s dream is to be able to grow her business even more; she wants to put in a sewing workshop so she can teach and give jobs to anyone who wants to learn to embroider and those who really want to make it.  She also wants to keep supporting her children with their education so they can have good professions and better lives.  \r\n\r\nThe group members and their professions are:\r\n\r\nJacinto G.

The members of the group selected this name because they consider themselves to be extremely hardworking women who want to succeed and move forward so that they can provide a better future for their families.\r\n<p>\r\nThe description will focus on Sra. Francisca Felisa N. G., one of the members of this group of women entrepreneurs who want to excel.  She is 61 years old and has been a widow since she was 40.  Francisca has two children. Miguel is 27 years old and works to help his mother with the household expenses.  Jes\u00fas is 23 years old and studying for a law degree while his brother and mother support him.  Francisca earns a living by making embroidered blouses and gowns, as well as candles.  The loan she will receive will be used to buy more fabric, thread, and other materials needed to continue making these traditional garments.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca says she decided to pursue this business activity because she learned the skills from her mother when she was eleven years old.  She started this business 30 years ago.  Since the death of her husband, she needed to find a way for her children to get ahead.  Francisca is very pleased with the results of her business.  She has had great success with the number of customers she has gained and it continue to grow since she travels to different states in the republic, where she sells traditional clothing along with her fellow group members.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Francisca says that neither she nor the other members have failed to make their loan payments.  These women are hardworking, responsible, prompt, and trustworthy.  Over time they have gotten to know one another since are from the same community.  This is not their first loan with FRAC.  In fact, they have taken several of them and have not had any problems.  \r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca is extremely grateful for the support and the trust that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva lenders have given to her and her fellow group members.  She is thankful that they will be able to get ahead in their businesses and help their families improve their quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca dreams of being able to support her children.  She wants to help her younger son finish his degree so that he can find a good job and not have to suffer like his brother by having to work in the fields, work at jobs with low pay, or go through stretches of time when no work is available.  She also wants to either build or buy a store where she can sell traditional clothing so that she does not have to travel in order to generate better income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group and their business activities are as follows:\r\nSof\u00eda G.

O. since she is one of the group leaders.  She is 38 years old, married and has three children.  One child is in high school, one in middle school and the youngest is in elementary school.  Tomasa sells bedspreads, tablecloths and sometimes tarps.  She says that the loan she\u2019ll get will be used to buy more bedspreads, sheets, drapes and tablecloths to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nShe decided to go into this line of work because one of her girlfriends recommended it because she said good profits can be made and because she wanted to find a way to help her husband meet household expenses and pay for their children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because she says she is doing very well with her business because her sales have increased much.  She now has more customers than she had before thanks to the good service and treatment she provides, aside from the excellent prices.  This is why her income has increased notably.\r\n\r\nTomasa says that she\u2019s never failed to make her repayments on time.  Neither have her fellow members because they are all responsible, punctual women but above all, very hard working.  They have known each other for a long time and this is their 3rd loan with FRAC.  They trust each other and don\u2019t want to disappoint those people that support them and believe in them.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and the donors because without their help she would have not accomplished all she has so far like improving her quality of life and that of her family as well as being able to continue with her business and continue to invest in it.\r\n\r\nTomasa\u2019s goal is to have her business grow and prosper even more than it has to date.  She wants to build a locale to install her linens shop so that she doesn\u2019t have to continue to sell door-to-door.  She also wants to continue to support her children\u2019s education so that they may complete higher education and have a good profession.\r\n\r\nThe group members and their activities are as follows:\r\n\r\nTomasa L.

They live in the brow of the Peruvian jungle located in Quimbiri where she has her own home.  Casilda has always enjoyed listening to advice from her family and through them she began agriculture, specifically cultivating and selling coffee and cocoa.  She remembers starting with coffee crops but in a short time she noticed that her product had a lot of demand and she continued her job but as the years passed, she decided to introduce a new crop, cocoa, so that she can have more customers.  Today her agricultural business is her main source of income and it gives her very good revenue, she has a good status in her area since her products are of very high quality and her potential customers are satisfied with the products that she offers.  A little while ago she opened a small store where she sells beverages for her compatriots.  Casilda usually works with her partner and they make a good working team but during harvest season the farmhands are in charge so they help extract the final product.  The crops are usually sold in areas where people gather.  Her daily routine is to leave at 7:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening.  Her plans for the future are to expand her beverage business by introducing new products like basic household goods.  This is Casilda's second loan with MFP (Kiva\u2019s field partner) and she is committed to pay the quotas during the established time periods as she enjoys her communal group.  With the loan, Casilda plans to buy merchandize and manure so that she can give the proper care to her cocoa and coffee crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva

Ram\u00edrez.  This is her story: she is a single mother who struggles daily to support her 4 children who are between the ages of 13 and 23, since they are all in school.  She is a dressmaker, and with the loan she received she is going to buy zippers, thread, fabric, needles, and other materials that she needs to continue with her work.\r\n\r\nClaudia Francisca decided to go into this line of work because she learned to sew a number of years ago since her mother taught her these skills. Also, she needed to find a way to support her children so that they would have a better future, since she did not have anyone to support her economically.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that the sales in her business are going well.  Now that the children have returned to school she has had a lot of work because she had a large number of orders for uniforms for the elementary, secondary and pre-schools.  Thanks to this work her income increased substantially.\r\n\r\nShe wants to give thanks to FRAC and to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to them she has been able to continue with her business and continue supporting her children in their studies.  She has also substantially increased the quality of life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nClaudia Francisca dreams of being able to buy 4 sewing machines to put in her sewing workshop.  In this way she could employ women like her who are single mothers and need work to support their children.  In addition, she wants to continue to pay for her children's education so that they can finish their professional degrees and have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nThe members of the communal bank \"Las Guerreras\" and the activities they carry out are the following:\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa M.

She lives with her partner and has a 6-year-old daughter, Ciomara. They live together in their own home in the town of Quimbiri, located in the lovely rain forest of Cusco. Since she was a teenager Rene has enjoyed contributing to her family. Every morning they would go to their main source of income, the cultivation of cacao, where she worked and sowed the land. For this work her parents gave her pocket money for personal expenses. \r\n\r\nCurrently she produces and sells cacao and coffee. She stresses that all the knowledge she acquired during her adolescence has carried over into her agricultural business and is yielding good economic results. The product she offers is of the highest quality and is reasonably priced. In general she works with her partner and together they make a good working team, but at harvest time she's in charge of her workers and aims to facilitate the extraction and transfer of her agricultural products to the town's commerce center to sell to customers and improve her quality of life. This is her second loan with MFP and she's committed to meeting the payment time line. She's grateful for her communal bank for the solidarity that prevails. With this loan she's requesting she hopes to invest in the purchase of supplies and fertilizers to adequately maintain her cacao and coffee crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate

She has just finished a course in Business Administration but didn\u2019t complete her thesis so doesn\u2019t have the official qualification.\r\n\r\nShe lives in Cochabamba with her mother--her father left them many years ago--so her mother had to raise her and her siblings alone. Gabriela works as a cashier in a bank in Cochabamba. The family lives in rented accommodation as their house is being built. The loan will be used to buy construction material so the house can be finished. Then they can move into their new home, stop paying rent, and all live more comfortably.\r\n\r\nAmong Gabriela\u2019s dreams and goals is the wish to become properly qualified and then take her master\u2019s degree in finance. In this way she would be able to help her mother to pay the household expenses and her siblings to complete their education.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

The loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a hard-working group with a common goal of improving the standards of living in their individual homes as well as their community at large. All these women are motivated to contribute in a meaningful way to the family income. The group is formed of family members and friends who know one another on a deep and personal level, having lived the majority of their lives in the same, tight-knit community. In this particular community, the density of communal banks is high. This is due to the reputation Fundacion Mujer has garnered with community members over the years, and the subsequent promotion of our lending model through word of mouth. \r\n \r\nThe women of this group are engaged in various agricultural activities, on which they rely as a source of income to support their families. This loan will be used for general investments in agriculture, which will improve crop yields or support the rearing of animals. Many of the group members, including Shirley, Ada R. and Digna, produce bananas and plantains. As a result, this loan will be used to invest in the purchase of seeds, nutrients, vitamins, and hired labor in order to perform physically strenuous tasks, such as harvesting and the transport of produce. The bananas and plantains produced by these women are either consumed or sold to members of the community as well as exporters who travel to Shiroles in order to purchase in bulk. With respect to the rearing of animals, some of the group members are in the pig rearing business. For these members, the loan will be used to invest in animal feed in order to ensure a quality pork product to customers in the community. \r\n\r\nGrace R. H. is the treasurer of this group. She lives with her husband and son in Shiroles. Grace will use this loan to purchase nutrients to feed her pigs. A busy entrepreneur; Grace organizes her day in the following manner.  She wakes up early in order to get a head start on household chores (preparing her son for school, cleaning the house, preparing breakfast etc). When those chores are finished, she feeds the pigs and after that, she goes to work. Grace's goal is to increase the production of pork. She wants to increase her income from pork sales in order to achieve financial independence and be able to dedicate more resources to her family.  Grace says that a major obstacle she faces is the high prices for animal feed combined with the low market price for pork meat. Grace has also found it difficult to secure a constant buyer for her produce.\r\n\r\nGrace says that because the members of this group are all family or neighbors from the same community, they can learn from each other and support each other in their businesses. She says the name of the group signifies that God is at the center of everything the group takes part in and is \u201calways with us.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":591290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase animal feed and nutrients for bananas and plantains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Shiroles, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-08-28T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sugey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Anicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1950000,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3875,"local_amount":1950000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1951837.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-28T22:13:51Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226913,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victoria, de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene seis hijos en su haber.

From age 15 he had been an employee of a small company, doing the same thing, but the owner  wanted to invest in maintenance, as the machines were deteriorating, so rather than invest, she offered Freddy a partnership.  This allowed him to keep 50% of the profits from the service.  Over time, the owner lost interest in the business and left it to John Freddy, who, given the difficulty of the preventive maintenance, decided to learn it and now does it all himself.  He is very careful with his machines and cares for them very well.  John Freddy has one assistant and 30 machines in two different locations.  He also has two tricycles that he uses to deliver the machines to where the customers request.\r\n\r\nHe would like to continue with his education, but his wife is currently in school and he needs to wait until he is better organized, because they must also care for their five year old son.

His partner, with whom he has 5 children, helps him.  Eduardo started the business working, with his brother for 17 years, then striking off on his own by investing his savings in a similar business.  He started with just two tables but, over time, the business has grown and he now has two food stalls.  Among other things, he sells hamburgers, hotdogs, sausages and grilled chicken, to which he adds his own special sauce.  He operates the business from 5:00pm to 11:00pm during the week and from 5:00pm to 1:00am on weekends.  This is Eduardo's fifth loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, a bank that has long supported him.  He says that he always saves for slow periods of the year and that the bank has helped him buy tables and chairs which have helped him to improve the business and make it more comfortable for his customers.  He will use this loan from Kiva to buy tables and chairs and ingredients for the food he makes.  Although this Eduardo's only business, it has allowed him to support and improve the lives of his family.  Now he hopes to set up a similar business in his home \"departamento\" of Cordoba so that he can continue to expand it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Thu\u1ef3 is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 058 - Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.7.058 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng ).\r\n\r\nThu\u1ef3 is single and has an adult-aged child. To make a living, Thu\u1ef3 raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Thu\u1ef3 has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 500,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Thu\u1ef3 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Thu\u1ef3 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1963500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 4248000 VND, which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Thu\u1ef3 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

It\u2019s part of the Valle parish, which has a cold climate.  Farming and raising livestock are its people\u2019s traditional occupations.  Most of the population goes out in the mornings, to work in the city of Cuenca, to work various trades, and returns in the evening.  Our associates work different trades, but with the same goal; to get their families ahead and offer them a better future.\r\n\r\nCarmen Isabel C. lives in the Conchan del Milagro community, which is a part of the Valle parish.  This will be her third loan through the foundation.  The prior ones have helped her small business.  She is a seamstress who learned this trade five years ago when one of her friends taught her.  She now works out of a small workshop in her home, alongside her husband who also works in this trade.  They do all sorts of sewing and repairs.  They don\u2019t have a regular schedule, but they work Monday through Saturday.  Sunday is a family day.  Carmen is very young, barely 23.  She is married and has two children, one is two years old and the other is four months old.  They don\u2019t have a house of their own yet, so they live in a house that her mother loaned them.  She will use the money from this loan to invest in a new sewing machine that they need.  Her goal is to complete her collage education, now that she has completed five [out of six] years of study.\r\n\r\nRosa Aurora Q. lives in the Maluay de Curiquinga community, which is a part of the Valle parish.  She is 49 years old, is married and has 10 children.  Her three oldest are married and on their own.  Her single children are 27, 17, 15, 13, 11, 10, and 5.  Her 27 year old daughter and her 13 year old son work in the home and help with the chores.  Her 17 and 15 year old sons work and help with the household finances.  Her three youngest attend the local school.  Her husband stays home, now that he is of old age.  They were able to have their house built by working together.\r\n\r\nRosa works the trade that her parents gave her; farming.  She works her own land, where she grows corn, potatoes, etc.  Some of her harvest is for her own consumption and some she sells.  She also raises hogs and Guinea pigs, which she sells to people in her community.  This will be her second loan from the communal bank and she is happy about the loans that she has benefited from in her home.  She will use the money from this loan to buy a cow.  She wants to continue to stay in good health.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":591333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"Sewing machine \/ Cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-29T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Sandra                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narcisa Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ubaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janneth Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Consolacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3520,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":352},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":352}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":352.5,"local_amount":352,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":352.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113569,"comment":null},{"amount":705,"local_amount":704,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:14Z","rounded_local_amount":705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407293,"comment":null},{"amount":352.5,"local_amount":352,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":352.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388396,"comment":null},{"amount":352.5,"local_amount":352,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":352.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388397,"comment":null},{"amount":352.5,"local_amount":352,"processed_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":352.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388398,"comment":null},{"amount":705,"local_amount":704,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682846,"comment":null},{"amount":705,"local_amount":704,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-30T03:34:53Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226942,"name":"Ma.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Food Vending (bananaque),  a general store and e-loading. Her husband, Francisco T., who is 46 years old, works as an electrician to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 16 years old. Ma. Lina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Lina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for the general store and bananaque (fried banana on a stick) so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Lina T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

hardworking entrepreneur, Nancy D. C. has run a fishing and fish trading business for almost 10 years from the village of Nauring, Pandan in the province of Antique, earning her a reasonable monthly profit. Nancy\u2019s main challenge is her small amount of stock because she only has a small amount of working capital to put into her fishing business. \r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI, a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2003 and is very grateful for secured access to capital and other services such as savings and insurance. Now Nancy wants to request a larger loan for their growing fishing business. Nancy will sell the fish her husband catches in their village and to some people wanting to sell fish in the market. She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and cater to the other family needs. With access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Nancy is hopeful her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete college degrees will be achieved. Nancy\u2019s wishes to give her children a brighter future fuel her commitment to her fishing business. \r\n\r\nWith all of her plans for the growth of her business, Nancy would be happier if her children are able to achieve their personal dreams and have their own life out of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":540,"image":{"id":591341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Additional

She lives in Hda. San Ramon, Brgy. Poblacion, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts by working hard in her general store and hog raising businesses.  She is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,000 PHP. Maria Flor is now borrowing 19,500 PHP to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria Flor aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have been running this business since 2003 and have three sewing machines at the moment. One corner of their living room is fitted as a tailoring workshop. \r\n\r\nThey have their own customers and make around 40 to 50 dresses and accessories a month. They also sell them at \"Narantuul,\" the largest local outdoor market in Ulaanbaatar city. Nowadays, the traditional national dress is a very fashionable item in Mongolia. People wear them on special occasions, like wedding ceremonies, school graduations, during national holidays and so on. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, they took a loan from the bank and bought a small house and paid it off recently. The reason they are requesting this loan is they want to buy building materials and make some modifications and repairs to the house. Mrs. Tumendelger's future plan is to extend her business, to repair the house and to have their own family car one day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":591344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Building materials to make some modifications and repairs to the house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2010-08-28T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tumendelger","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88950},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109459.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":111644.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":112775.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":113215.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":131333.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125144.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134089.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136462.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140888.1},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147184.06},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148853.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.89},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.36},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.3},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":88950,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90650.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177388040,"comment":null},{"amount":1105.32,"local_amount":1411050,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1438024.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182526185,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-29T14:52:45Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":226948,"name":"Praeng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village loan group consists of thirteen people who live in BoE.

They wanted to help their granddaughter pursue a career; that is why they have kept on working and earning. Also, the couple is getting older and they want to enjoy a better life and save in preparation for their retirement. \r\n\r\nFor almost five years, the couple has been engaged in managing a variety store. Aside from the income of her husband, the profit from their store helped the family by providing for a good education among their children. This has continued to be their second source of income. \r\n\r\nAve wanted to apply for another loan to buy a boat for her husband to use in fishing, a bicycle for delivery, a parcel of land for farming and additional grocery products to display in the store. She will also buy two sacks of sugar and ten sacks of charcoal. They also want to help their community by providing employment to people, and they will continue to support their family. \r\n\r\nThey are hoping ASHI and KIVA will always be there to support their dreams in life. Ave R. is a very good member of Ahon sa HIrap, Inc.(ASHI)-Rizal Central Branch, a partner Micro-finance Institution of KIVA in the Philippines.

The official name of this borrowing group is Elsie B. Group.\r\n\r\nElsie is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Elsie owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 2800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elsie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Elsie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate translation by Kiva.

Alomina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lelit A., 40 years old and married, is a resident of Ba\u00f1adero, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental.  Lelit is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lelit A.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\n<p>Lelit is blessed with 7 children; 3 of them are now working and the rest are school-aged.  Lelit sells HYPO, a chemical used to remove stains and molds. She is also employed at Naomi\u2019s Botanical Garden as a maintenance worker and receives support from her husband, Eddie, who is also a maintenance worker and gardener at the same workplace. After 5 years selling HYPO, Lelit is able to maintain the business and the couple now earns an average monthly net income of at least PHP 1,200, which is very helpful to their family income. \r\n\r\n<p>Lelit joined the cooperative just this year upon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a microfinance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she has successfully repaid a loan of PHP 3,000. She is now requesting a loan of PHP 5,000 as her 2nd loan to be used as additional capital for her HYPO business. The future income from this loan will be used to improve her family's living conditions, to meet their basic needs, to repay loans to PMPC and for savings, insurance, the children\u2019s  education and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n<p>About PMPC:\t\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Janechit is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Janechit R.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\n<p>Janechit is blessed with 2 school-aged children.  She is involved in operating a sari-sari (variety) store and selling longganisa (sausages).  Janechit  receives support from her husband, Marcelino, who is an automotive painter. After 3 years of operating the store and selling longganisa, Janechit is able to maintain the business and the couple now earns an average monthly net income of at least PHP 6,000, which is very helpful to their family income. \r\n\r\n<p>Janechit  joined the cooperative in 2009 upon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a microfinance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she has successfully repaid a loan of PHP 7,500. She is now requesting an amount of PHP 10,000 as her 3rd cycle loan to be used for additional capital for her existing businesses. The future income from this loan will be used to improve her family's living conditions, to meet their basic needs, to repay loans to PMPC and for savings, the children\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been engaged in this kind of fruit and vegetable vending activity for 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lucina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucina is an active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP Program, a microfinance program that reaches out rural communities, and has already successfully repaid a loan of 5,000 PHP. She is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP as her second loan, to be used as additional capital for her fruit and vegetable vending business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, especially to meet their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, insurances and possible business expansions. \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She has three children: her elder daughter is nineteen, her elder son is sixteen and her younger daughter is twelve. Her elder daughter studies at the institution of higher education and her son and younger daughter go to school. Her husband is carpenter. Elmira sells honey. It was suggested by her aunt that she start selling honey in order to increase her income. Twenty years ago, Elmira bought honey and all necessary business supplies for 8,000 KGS and she earns about $195 monthly. She applied for a loan to buy a 200 liter kettle for the honey-making process. With the profits from selling honey, she plans to give her son a higher education and buy furniture for her house.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nMarvarhan K. is the treasurer of the group. She is forty two and a widow. She has four children: her daughters are fifteen, thirteen and six and her son is ten years old. Her elder daughters and her son go to school and her youngest daughter is at home. Five years ago, Marvarhan received a loan from the micro-finance company \u201cFINCA\u201d in the amount of 5,000 KGS and bought honey. Then she resold that honey at a higher price. Now she gets about $175 monthly from selling honey. In order to increase her turnover she is applying for a loan because she doesn\u2019t have enough funds. \r\n\r\nSonaiym C. is forty-seven and married. She has four children: her daughters are twenty-three, twenty-one, and eighteen and her son is fourteen. Her elder daughter is a recent graduate and now is in search of employment opportunities. Her second and third daughters study at an institution of higher education, and her son goes to school. Her husband is a taxi driver. Nineteen years ago, Sonaiym was selling clothes when her friend suggested she switch to selling convenience goods. She bought some convenience goods for 30,000 KGS and started selling them. Now, she makes about $320 monthly. She has been able to buy an area already planted in a crop and to give her children an opportunity to study at the institution of higher education on the profits from her business. She is applying for a loan in order to get necessary funds for increasing the assortment of goods she sells. In the future, she plans to expand her business and buy a shop for her convenience goods. \r\n\r\nAizada A. is twenty-two and married. She has two sons: the elder is one year old and her younger son is eight months. Her husband is a computer administrator in a computer club. Aizada sells convenience goods at the local market or from home. In 2009, her neighbor offered her the chance to help in selling convenience goods, and then start selling on her own. She started with a purchase of goods for 25,000 KGS. Now she gets about $195 a month as an income from selling convenience goods. She is planning to increase the assortment but she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds; therefore, she is applying for a loan. In the future, she is planning to build a shop near her house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing  24,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more addtional capital for stocks of rice and feeds to resell so that she could continue to save up for the future to have an additional business (a grocery). \r\n\r\nGina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
