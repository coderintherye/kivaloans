In the future she wants to move her business to a safer area and have more people working for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":514284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Uniform fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucrecia Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":114.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":120.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":123.29},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":126.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":129.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":152.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.32},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.47,"local_amount":94.47,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":94.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708329,"comment":null},{"amount":108.7,"local_amount":108.7,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":108.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891525,"comment":null},{"amount":112.28,"local_amount":112.28,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":112.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631774,"comment":null},{"amount":114.32,"local_amount":114.32,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":114.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845660,"comment":null},{"amount":117.23,"local_amount":117.23,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":117.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111937,"comment":null},{"amount":120.75,"local_amount":120.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":120.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405343,"comment":null},{"amount":123.29,"local_amount":123.29,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":123.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543829,"comment":null},{"amount":256.41,"local_amount":256.41,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680592,"comment":null},{"amount":152.55,"local_amount":152.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":152.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378939,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T14:13:40Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189045,"name":"Salinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salinah S., 45, is married to Benjamin Ossen who is 54yrs old and an employee of Kuda (Kerio Valley Development Authority).

M. is 65 and married with 65 children.  She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Malia has 6 years of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Malia joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Tumema's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 42 and married with 2 children (ages 8 and 12).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Tolfi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tolfi needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Tolfi joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tolfi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 73 and widowed with 10 children (ages 20 - 50).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taamu for sale.  Maria has 4 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\n\nIn 2008, Maria joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 38 and married with 6 children (ages -month - 21).  She owns a business venture, raising cattle for sale.  Tetee has 4 years of experience in this business.  Tetee needs a loan of WST $1500 to expand shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\n\nIn 2007, Tetee joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tetee's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 40 and married with 5 children (ages 4 - 18).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting cocoa for sale.  Selepa has 4 years of experience in this business.  Selepa needs a loan of WST $2250 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support extended members of her family.\n\nIn 2006, Selepa joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Selepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is an entreprenuerial woman who manages two businesses simultaneously: selling various merchandise like clothes, quilts, and bedspreads on one end and selling fish like bocachico, snapper, and tilapia on the other.\r\n\r\nAt age 25 she came to Barranquilla from her hometown San Onofre in the department of Sucre.  When her first daughter was born she felt the need to make more money.  As a result of her five years working as a maid and in restaurants, she was able to begin selling merchandise brought from Valledupar in Cesar and from Maicao in Guajira.  This is how she began selling sets of sheets and towels, which she did over ten years.  In 1998, she began selling fish that her sister bought for her.  She built up a solid customer base with more than 25 to 30 clients from different neighborhoods like El Recreo, Las Delicias, and Boston.  Her two businesses complement each other well, generating income through credit and cash, as is the case with the fish. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with the Foundation.  The loans have impacted her business environment positively, by allowing her to make higher-volume purchases and respond to the needs of new customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to have a small store where she can sell her merchandise.  She wants a boutique since her business has been going well and she has an exclusive customer base that she has chosen over the years.  They are professors and employees who she gives credit to and they pay her every fifteen days.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":514393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying merchandise like towels, sheets, dresses, and fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88349},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98314},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100362},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102453},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104588},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106767},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108991},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111262},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113580},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115946},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":118361},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":131027}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":88349,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88567.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712302,"comment":null},{"amount":51.05,"local_amount":98314,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":98557.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895803,"comment":null},{"amount":52.11,"local_amount":100362,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100610.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636129,"comment":null},{"amount":53.2,"local_amount":102453,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":102706.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850225,"comment":null},{"amount":54.3,"local_amount":104588,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":104847.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116990,"comment":null},{"amount":55.44,"local_amount":106767,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":107031.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410858,"comment":null},{"amount":56.59,"local_amount":108991,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":109261.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550515,"comment":null},{"amount":57.77,"local_amount":111262,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":111537.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688117,"comment":null},{"amount":58.98,"local_amount":113580,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":113861.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427363,"comment":null},{"amount":189.69,"local_amount":365334,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":366239.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000773,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T00:48:32Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189070,"name":"Seydy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Seydy M.

Suarez is a 30 year-old woman.  She is a signle mother who lives with her 10 year-old son in a community named Santa Fe located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province.  The community is known for being a mountainous zone near the northern border of the country.  Her principal economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the planting of basic grains, sugar cane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nA year ago, Ms. Seydy decided to start her own business, so she opened a boookstore.  She thinks it was a good idea because there was no bookstore in her community and the local students had to travel hours on bike to get their materials for school.  She assures her business improved the quality of life for her and her son.  She believes it is time to move forward and enlarge her store.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs a loan of \u00a2665000 (six hundred sixty-five thousand colones) to buy more books to stock her bookstore.  This will allow her to offer greater and better services that will be able to satisfy the needs of the community, particularly the students.\r\n\r\nMs. Seydy is a member of the community bank Manantial in Santa Fe, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan and with it she hopes to grow on a personal and economic level.  She also stresses that thanks to these types of organizations and means of facilitating loans can help many single mothers be successful small businesswomen.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

L. is 25 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Vaomau has 2 years of experience in this business.  Vaomau needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 180 talas or US $75 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Vaomau joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaomau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

es un padre de familia de 25 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y a su menor hijo en el sector El Imperial del distrito de Olmos, en la provincia de Lambayeque, ubicado a una hora y cincuenta minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde que era muy joven se dedica a brindar servicios de transporte de carga y pasajeros en una mototaxi, empez\u00f3 su negocio alquilando unidades m\u00f3viles para trabajarlas y poco a poco fue ahorrando el dinero que necesitaba para comprar la suya. Actualmente se vale de su veh\u00edculo para brindar servicio de transporte en la ciudad de Olmos y tambi\u00e9n en los caser\u00edos y anexos de la zona. Cabe mencionar que el distrito de Olmos tiene una alta concentraci\u00f3n de poblaci\u00f3n en caser\u00edos y anexos, considerados como zonas rurales.\n\nEl continuo uso brindado a su unidad m\u00f3vil y los caminos accidentados que recorre diariamente brindando su servicio, han hecho que su unidad empiece a sufrir algunas fallas mec\u00e1nicas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para su correcto funcionamiento, por ello Natividad se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en el mantenimiento y reparaci\u00f3n de su veh\u00edculo.\n\nNatividad es un joven responsable y trabajador, es un padre muy entregado a su joven familia y es muy estimado por las personas que lo conocen, ellos lo consideran un muchacho de confianza y servicial. Su sue\u00f1o es seguir creciendo como empresario y adquirir otra mototaxi.\n\n","en":"     Natividad is a 25-year-old father who lives with his wife and minor child in the Imperial Section, in the Olmos District, in the province of Lambayeque. This is located an hour and forty minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n     Since he has been very young he has worked transporting cargo and passengers in a motorcyle\/taxi. He started his business renting mobile units and using them for work. Little by little he saved enough money to buy his own vehicle. Actually, he uses his vehicle to provide transportation services in Olmos City and also to the farms and outskirts of the city. He would like to explain that the district of Olmos has a high concentration of population that live in farmhouses and in the outskirts, which is considered the rural zone.\r\n     He uses his vehicle on roads that experience accidents each day in order to provide services to his customers. This has caused his vehicle to begin to experience some mechanical failures that require urgent attention in order for the vehicle to function well. This is why Natividad has seen the need to ask, for the first time from \u201cEdpyme Alternativa\u201d, for a loan of 1000 new soles.

Luis est\u00e1 justamente ubicado  en las afueras de uno de los escenarios de futbol mas importante de Colombia: el estadio Metropolitano; \u00e9l es pionero en su actividad y trabaja junto a su esposa (a su lado en la fotograf\u00eda) durante mas de 12 horas diarias de lunes a domingo; sus clientes son los peatones, recomendados y los seguidores del  Futbol, inclusive provenientes de otros estadios del pa\u00eds; tiene una gran competencia pero se sostiene porque es innovador, consigue precios buenos para sus clientes  y diversifica constantemente el surtido que ofrece. En la actualidad solicita un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $1.300.000 para comprar art\u00edculos deportivos al pormayor  y de contado, especialmente de cada uno de los que exhibe como souvenirs, camisetas de diferentes equipos, banderas y afiches.\nSus cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n siempre han sido para incrementar el surtido y en alguna oportunidad con ellos pudo  salir de deudas onerosas con los paga diario. Su meta principal es pasar de la informalidad a la formalidad y convertirse en mayorista  y es que estos son precisamente sus desaf\u00edos.\n","en":"Luis Enrique is 56 years old and a die-hard Barranquila soccer fan. This was his main inspiration when stopped selling fruit and started his current business in the 20 de Julio square, in Barranquilla. He has been selling sportswear such as jerseys, pants, socks, accessories, key chains and flags since 2000 and, for him, this has been more profitable than his previous business in that market. \r\n\r\nLuis's business is located just outside one of Colombia's most important sports arena, the Metropolitano Stadium. He is the pioneer in his activity and works along with his wife (pictured by his side) for more than 12 hours a day, from Monday to Sunday. His clients are pedestrians, people referred to him and soccer fans, including from other stadiums in the country. He has a strong competition but he is able to stand out for being innovative, having good prices and diversifying the inventory he offers. \r\n\r\nHe is currently asking for a loan in the amount of $1.300.000 to buy sports articles wholesale and in cash, especially the ones he offers such as souvenirs, jerseys of different teams, flags and accessories. \r\n\r\nHis loans with the bank have always been aimed to increase the variety of his inventory.

G. is 40 years old and lives with her husband and four children, who are between the ages of 9 and 19, in the neighborhood of La Paz in Barranquilla.  This neighborhood is known for its religious festivals, such as the Festival of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and the Holy Week processions.  \r\n<p>\r\nMuriel\u2019s business consists of a mini-grocery store where she sells rice, oil, sugar, milk, bread, salt, and coffee.  She also has household products in stock such as soap, shampoo, and other items.  Muriel started her store four years ago when she quit her clothing by catalog order business.  She always enjoyed working and wanted to start another business.  Now her customers include her friends, relatives, and neighbors.  She goes to their homes to boost her sales by advertising whenever she has new products.  However, she considers her greatest challenges to be the location of her business because it is not visible from the outside, the lack of space, and insufficient capital.  To resolve these issues, her goal is to have a larger store in her main room that provides more space and is more visible from the street.\r\n<p>\r\nMuriel is currently requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP.  Half of the money will be invested in the purchase of products for her business.  The other half will be used to improve her home by raising the ceiling because it is quite low.  Although this is her second loan, her husband has been associated with the Foundation for several years.  During this season, the two of them plan to acquire more supplies, attract more customers, and continue making more sales.  In addition, they hope to build a kitchen and add another room to their home.  Later on, Muriel dreams of completely remodeling her house and also providing her children with an education so that they can finish both high school and college.

Guti\u00e9rrez, 46, lives in Barranquilla\u2019s El Pueblo neighborhood, a popular, cheerful, high-spirited neighborhood in the southwestern part of the city which, sadly, is infamous due to flooding during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has three children, the youngest of whom are a 17-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter.  Bertilda makes snacks like deditos (little finger-shaped pastries) and turnovers.  She sells the larger deditos in stores and the smaller ones are ordered by people for parties and other special events. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a $1.800.000 loan to buy ingredients like wheat flour, cooking oil, sugar and cheese so that she can increase production and add more stores and schools to her distribution points list. \r\n\r\nBertilda started her business 8 years ago when she moved from her mother-in-law\u2019s house to a different neighborhood, El Pueblo.  She learned from her mother, \u201ca woman who knows how to do everything,\u201d and passed it on to her children.  When the need arose to help her husband with household expenses, she turned to the manufacture of snacks.  Her husband delivers door-to-door and sometimes helps her take the product to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe has been associated with the Fundaci\u00f3n for about 4 years and she states that she is better off financially because she\u2019s been able to improve her house: she tiled the kitchen floor and considers this to be very important to her business because it\u2019s more hygienic and attracts more customers.\r\n\r\nShe says that her greatest challenge is the lack of capital and remembers that there was a time when she had the opportunity to sell her products to casinos but lack of capital then kept her from doing so.\r\n\r\nDespite drop in sales during this season, she knows that everything will improve the next few months.\r\n\r\nShe wants to attract more customers in order to progress and reach her goal of helping her children become professionals so that they can live better.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

M. is a 33 year old gentleman who lives with his mother in the small community of La Trinchera de Pital in Alajuela Province. The main activities of the region are livestock production and agriculture, with an emphasis on the cultivation of pineapples that are sold primarily to international markets. For this reason, community development has increased in recent years and has generated more demand for goods and services by providing more job opportunities.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Alexander is a farmer.  At the moment he is devoted to growing cassava, a tuber that has a pleasant flavor and is rich in nutrients. Agro-industrial processing of this crop has increased because demand is great in Costa Rica and in other countries. \r\n<p>\r\nDon Alexander is currently requesting a loan of 400,000 CRC to increase his harvest.  This will help with preparing the land for planting by purchasing seeds, fertilizers, composts, and other supplies that are necessary to ensure an optimum output. With this investment, he hopes for a good harvest that produces a product with the appropriate features that will command a higher sales price. The start of a successful project will allow him to help his mother because she is solely dependent on him and very ill.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Alexander is a member of the Communal Enterprise of the Successful Women of La Trinchera de Pital, one of 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and financially. He also actively participates in his local credit organization.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in her own home with her 2 youngest daughters, for whom  she wants to provide a better life.  \r\n\r\nThe beautiful countryside of the Villa Visca village has been, for Maria, a good place to start a family and see it grow.  From the time she was very small her parents taught her to work on the farm, and now she has her own lands on which she works with a lot of care and sacrifice.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is to cultivate peas, potatoes and corn.   She has been doing this for 26 years, and what she considers most difficult is to transport her products to the place where they are sold in the market in the city.  With time, she hopes to have a small stall in the market, since she feels that she loses out  a lot by selling her products at wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is the 5th loan that Maria has taken from MFP.  She knows that she has the responsibility to make all of her payments on time, and she is ready to do this.  Within her communal bank she is always aware of all of the agreements that they have reached as a group.

H., 59, lives in the canton of El Amate, located in San Isidro in the department of Caba\u00f1as.  She lives with her husband, who works in agriculture, and their two grandchildren.  Cruz has a business selling clothing for men, women and children.  She also markets skin care products and cosmetics.  Her business is located in a small commercial center which is located at the entrance of San Isidro.  This is a place that many people pass  through, as there is public transportation there, which benefits Cruz because her business is seen by all of these people.  Cruz also works as a street vendor selling clothing in various cantons in her area.  This assures her greater earnings, which is a great help to her family's economic welfare, as she and her husband are supporting their grandchildren.  For this reason she is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL, which she will use to invest in her business, buying more clothing and cosmetics, and stocking her business with other products such as shoes, underwear, and more.  One of Cruz's main wishes is to be able to take advantage of the Semana Santa (Easter Season), since at this time the sales rise, and this would be a great benefit for her.  <br

Una de las principales razones de estos es porque Laura ya posee 10 a\u00f1os de tener este negocio, por lo que es muy conocida en el lugar siendo recomendada por muchas personas. Laura solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a Integral por medio del cual pueda comprar toda la materia prima necesaria para poder elaborar mayor cantidad de comidas y de esta forma extender el men\u00fa, entre los ingredientes que ella m\u00e1s necesita est\u00e1n: granos b\u00e1sicos, sodas, frutas, verduras, golosinas y pan.

Her place of business is located across from the offices of the San Miguel Region Attorney General\u2019s office; most of her sales are to employees of this office, who are regular customers that consume her meals daily.  One of the main reasons this is so is that Laura has been in this line of work for 10 years so she is very well-known and highly recommended by many people in the area.\r\n\r\nLaura is asking for funds to buy all the raw ingredients she needs to make a larger quantity of meals so that she can expand her menu.  Among the most needed ingredients are: basic grains, soft-drinks, fruit, vegetables, snacks and bread.\r\n\r\nThis fills Laura with much enthusiasm because she is a hard-working woman who is always looking for ways to get ahead in life and provide for her two children, who are completely dependent on her.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is 55 years old. Teresita is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTeresita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. \r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the second loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Melonne has 3  more other children at her care. The couple live together with the children. Together, Melonne and her husband bear the expenses of the family. To contribute to the family expenses, Melonne runs a hairdressing salon at home and sells hair extensions in the salon through the same opportunity.\r\nIt is in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin that Melonne gets the products that she needs for the smooth running  of her salon. Melonne has been doing this business for  about eight years and has already got a loan from ALIDe that she repaid. Melonne wants to extend more her hairdressing salon and to beef up her working tools in order to meet the demands  of her customers. This makes her to request a second loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Cletus Kuunifaa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":514802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of  beauty products and hair extensions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-28T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melonne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653370,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835577,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575974,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954488,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056145,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":33216.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347680,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617561,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11072.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779670,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-31T21:41:33Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189252,"name":"Los","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Los V., 24, is married and resides with her husband and three children in Kampong Chnang Province, Cambodia, an area known for fishing and palm products.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells sugar cane juice for an income of about USD 2.5 per day.

Their principle is to be creative and keep on trying.\r\n<p>\r\nSeyilbubu O. is the leader of this group. By the age of 52 she had raised 4 sons. Seyilbubu is divorced and she successfully overcame the ordeal of being a sole provider for the family as her eldest son is married already and started to help support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nAs to Seyilbubu\u2019s occupation, she offers seamstress\u2019s services. She makes handycrafts to order. She used to produce handycrafts for domestic use only. However, afterwards she started receiving orders from her acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nThis activity has allowed her to lead a relatively independent life. Her monthly income amounts to about 60 USD. She thriftily saved money and was able to send her kids to school and provide them with school supplies and clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nNow Seyilbubu dreams about buying new household appliances and a new sewing machine. Before doing that she needs to make new handycrafts for sale. She is in need of a loan to purchase a hundred kg of wadding and fabric.\r\n<p>\r\nSeyilbubu\u2019s partners are:\r\n<p> \r\nBermet M., 39, is a mother of three children. Her husband works in construction. Bermet breeds cattle. Two of her children go to school. Bermet needs a loan to buy a cow. Bermet\u2019s dream is to provide her children with education.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnaz B., 34, has three children. Her eldest son, in spite of being just sixteen, already earns his own living. The other two children go to school. Gulnaz is a seamstress. She needs a loan to purchase fabric.\r\n<p>\r\nAinura E. K., 41, breeds cattle and sells milk. Her husband is a policeman. He works in a crime detection department. In his free time he helps his wife look after the cattle. Ainura hopes to obtain this loan and buy a cow for breeding.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>Where Did This Loan Come From?\r\n<\/em><p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Sometimes a staggering success awaits us just some steps ahead and we just have to move a stone which prevents us from seeing the path. Nabat S. is the leader of this group. She is fifty years old. Nabat\u2019s husband works as a security guard. As for Nabat, she offers sewing and tailoring services for local people. Besides this, she has mothered six children: five daughters and a son. Her elder daughters are married and live with their own families. The little daughter is a college student. As for her son, he has gone to Russia in search of work.\r\n\r\nWhether it is being a security guard or a seamstress, these occupations are not among well paid activities. However, years of tireless labor have allowed Nabat to buy a house and a car. Nabat\u2019s sister, who actually taught Nabat sewing, could not imagine that this favor of hers would have provided for Nabat her entire life. Nabat\u2019s monthly income is just $115. Nabat has applied for this loan and hopes to buy fabric for making bed linens and towels as she has secured some large orders. \r\n\r\nNabat\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nParizat C., 45, is a widow. She is engaged in trading in cattle. Parizat has four children. Three of her children work in Russia. Her little son is a school student. Parizat hopes to obtain this loan and buy sheep.\r\n\r\nGulzat K., 37, is a cattle breeder\u2019s wife. They have two children. Both Gulzat and her husband are engaged in breeding cattle. And Gulzat also sells milk. Their monthly income is around $180. Gulzat is in need of a loan. She hopes to buy construction materials for construction. \r\n\r\nKandalat S., 43, has four children. Her husband has gone to work in Russia. Kandalat keeps sheep and her monthly income is just a little over ten dollars. Kandalat hopes to obtain this loan and build a new fence, which would allow her to keep more sheep.\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

On one hand he is happy as he has started his business earlier than he thought. If he were to have got this leave later, the opportunities would not be as abundant as this time.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nMore about IMON International\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and money shortages never defeated Barno, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation. She is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 43 years old, married, and the loving mother of four children.\r\n\r\nBarno started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family expenses. For more than fourteen years she has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s shoes. Her store is well known and people love to visit it because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nBarno hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more shoes to sell. With this purpose in mind, Barno requests 8,000 Somoni. She promises to repay the loan on time and thanks everyone supporting her.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The client is involved in breeding and sales of small livestock.  Aydan started this business 20 years ago.  She had good conditions for breeding livestock, so she decided to give it a try, and the business went uphill.  Now she has 20 goats and a stable income.  Besides this business, Aydan is also involved in growing grain and vegetable crops.  She needs a loan to buy 250 kg of goat feed in order to feed the goats.\r\n\r\nUrpiya is 36, divorced.  She has two children.  She works as a notary public and also sews national goods at home.  Her grandmother used to sew such goods when Urpiya was a child.

She wants to use the loan to buy a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nZalayho, just like Mukaramkan, is involved in sales of porcelain dishware.

is 25 years old and he is still single.  Emmanuel is known as a proven entrepreneur baking breads, cakes, and some other pastries for sale.  This is his third successful year in this business.  He employs 17 people in his business and the hours of the business are from 6 am to 6 pm every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Emmanuel has been in this business for about three years, his seed money is still too low to satisfy all his customer's needs.  To end this, Emmanuel is requesting a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company.  With this loan, he hopes that he will satisfy all the demands of his customers and hopefully his profits will increase.

is 37 years old, married with two children and she takes care of two dependents.  Vestine is commonly known as a wholesaler in her business area.  The goods, which she wholesales, are cosmetic goods like body lotion, toothpaste, flour soap etc.  She has been in this business for about two years and the hours of her business are from early in the morning until late in the evening hours.\r\n\r\nVestine needs to request a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company so that she can expand her business by adding more cosmetic goods for wholesale.

is 54 years old and is married with four children who are 16, 18, 21 and 23 years old. Dina is a proven entrepreneur dealing in the sale of clothing items: mainly fabrics for clothes and some other items needed in sewing various styles of clothes.

M. is a native of San Jacinto, Bol\u00edvar. She is 45 years old and lives in the Blas de Lezo neighborhood in the city of Cartagena. She's married and has two children aged 13 and 7 who are students. She loves them with all her heart; that is to say, they are her reason for living. For the past several years, she has had a beauty and hairstyling salon where she also sells the types of merchandise her customers ask for in city neighborhoods. This is her first loan and she requests a loan of 2,000,000 COP. She would invest  it in outfitting her beauty salon and in buying products for her store such as jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts, blouses and other products requested by her customers. With this loan, she hopes to increase her customer numbers and continue with the process. When she opened this location, she wanted to offer her children a better quality of life so she can see them be happy and be professional, which she considers the best inheritance she could leave them. She also hopes to own her own home and and one day be recognized in her city as a great Columbian businesswoman.\r\n\r\nShe's had these two businesses for quite some time because her husband's job at Ecopetrol stops involves long periods of layoffs. Even though he earns a good living at this job, during certain times, her businesses are the ones that support the home. When that happens, he helps her sell the merchandise and perfume. She started the beauty salon because she needed income for the family. She's been doing nails since she was very young and she's always seen it as a source of employment. She took courses and little by little was able to buy her tools until she began her own beauty salon. Her customer base has grown significantly, but the majority of her customers demand more. Due to these demands, she's looking for a microloan from Fundaci\u00f3n because up until now, she has not felt it to be necessary. \r\n\r\nMarly thanks god for her family and for having given her the chance to improve each day with her position which she's been doing for so long with so much love. This has also allowed her to offer her family a better future. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Raquel Perez-Lopez, Kiva

He lives in his own house and is willing to work very hard with the aim of getting ahead in life. \r\n\r\nStill having a lifetime ahead of him, he knows that he has to put all of his effort into earning a steady living through his labor. He works growing potatoes, corn and peas, and when harvest time comes, he takes them to sell in the city's wholesale market. His clients (merchants) are familiar with the quality of his crops, and so they buy them up quickly. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is protecting his fields from pests. He has worked in farming for 10 years, and he thinks the hardest part is taking his products to the market where he sells them, since the sacks he carries are very heavy. For the future, he would like to buy more land in order to increase his agricultural production. \r\n\r\nThis is Nazario's eighth loan with MFP, and he knows that he needs to make his payments punctually if he wants to have access to another loan later. He is a very active participant in his communal bank. With the two thousand Peruvian new soles he is requesting, he will buy potato and pea seeds, as well as fertilizer and insecticides. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":515066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying seeds, fertilizer and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153961,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-27T19:45:13Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189421,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanne is 28 years old, married with two children as well as two dependents that are between 2 and 18 years old.

With these profits, he will sustain his business and in addition will start building his own house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":511429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying charcoal in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyarugenge Kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eric ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760512,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022938,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781981,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709882,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037236,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308943,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616541,"comment":null},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622750,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-12T05:17:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":189423,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence A.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Sesilia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sesilia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 36 and married with 3 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Perise joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Perise's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \n\nAiga wishes to join the program to assist in her business development.  In 2010, Aiga Silafai joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.

S. is 23 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Rosalina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Rosalina needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Rosalina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Rosalina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

N. is 44 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Victoria has 1 year of experience in this business.  Victoria needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nVictoria wishes to join the program to assist her business.  In 2010, Victoria joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Victoria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 27 and married with 4 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Sina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Afiafiese needs a loan of WST $2450 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nAfiafi wishes to keep her business development on going as she requests for another fund to support and assist her family financially.  Afiafiese joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Afiafiese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 31 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Fulisia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Fulisia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fulisia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fulisia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 38 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Ivo has 3 years of experience in this business.  Ivo needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Ivo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ivo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 42 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Noumea has 4 years of experience in this business.  Noumea needs a loan of WST $2000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\n\nThis is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Noumea's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 29 and married with 3 children.

Fofo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fofo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 39 and married with 3 children.

Feviiai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nThis is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Feviiai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ionatana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

is a 56-year-old mother of four. She lives with her husband, their two children, two grandchildren and the wife of one of their sons in Alajuelita, a region located in Costa Rica\u00b4s central valley. Angelita is an experienced client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Over the past 16 years, she has received numerous loans in various amounts to finance her sales business. Angelita plans to use the current loan to purchase clothes, shoes and perfumes, which she will sell to her clients in different parts of Costa Rica. The majority of her clients are women, though she offers products for men as well. Angelita does not drive; her main method of transportation is the public bus system.  \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Angelita performs domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and overall house maintenance. After lunch, she heads out to either purchase new products, collect on repayments from clients she has sold to on credit or to sell her products. Twice per month, Angelita travels 3 hours by bus to an area named Guapiles to visit her clients. \r\n\r\nAngelita says that the apartment her family lives in is small for seven people.

She is a hardworking woman who started her own sewing business with the funds provided by her husband from his work in an auto repair shop. Together, Leticia and her husband support their five children, providing them with a better education. Three of their children are working. \r\n\r\nTo increase her income, Leticia also sells chicken and eggs. The sales are brisk; hence Leticia's need to purchase a freezer. Right now, she only has one refrigerator and doesn't have the space to stock enough chicken. She also has a variety of other products, and thus she plans to buy a freezer which will be used for the sale of chicken. \r\n\r\nShe is happy about this investment since it will greatly improve her business. In the future, she plans to do renovations in her house; she would like to replace a wooden partition with a concrete wall.

M. is 38 and married with 6 children (ages 12 - 20).  She owns a business venture, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Tenisi has many years of experience in this business.  Tenisi needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Tenisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tenisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Ah K. is 49 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, raising pigs for sale.  Malae has 5 years of experience in this business.  Malae needs a loan of WST $2000 to expand shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 talas or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Malae joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 35 and married with 6 children (ages 5 - 10).  She owns a business venture, selling plant seedlings & young crops to local farmers.  Eterine has 2 years of experience in this business.  Eterine needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional agricultural equipment to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Eterine joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Eterine's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 30 and married with 1 child (1 year-old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tamalika has 2 years of experience in this business.  Tamalika needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Tamalika joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tamalika's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:
