P. is a resident of Talic, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental, Philippines. She is married with one child. She was engaged in \"suman\"-making (a traditional Filipino rice cake) at the time she got married. Her mother-in-law is the one who owned the business. As a newly-wed couple, their family entrusted them with assisting in running the business. <P>\r\n\r\nThe business is known to be one of Misamis Occidental\u2019s favorite spots for traditional delicacies. A lot of prominent people in the province place orders for traditional delicacies on special occasions and give them to their visitors as a sort of \"pasalubong\" (homecoming treat). Some foreign visitors bring the products to Las Vegas, Japan, Hongkong, and the United States of America.<P>\r\n\r\nDue to the high demand for their products, the couple needs more financial assistance to produce the supply needed. One day, a customer who is also a member of Paglaum MPC told Lyn about the program and services Paglaum MPC offers. On the following day, she attended the training and became a full-pledged member. In November 2003 she received her first loan amounting to three thousand pesos only. Now she is on her 11th loan cycle, amounting to fourteen thousand nine hundred pesos. <P>\r\n\r\nIn one way or another, the family considers that Paglaum MPC is behind their business successes. As of now, not only are the couple members but their parents are, too. Recently, the parents got a motor-vehicle loan to be used for the business. <P>\r\n\r\nThe family's future plans for the business are to acquire machinery to be used in the operation instead of manpower, to have their own house, and send their child to school. \"All of these plans are possible due to realization through the help of Paglaum MPC,\" Mrs.Lyn D.

Luzvilla S. is a bonafide resident of Lower Langcangan, Oroquieta City, province of Misamis Occidental, Mindanao, Philippines. She has been a widow since 1993 and has four children. Hard work and determination are the only weapons she had at the time her husband died but she managed to send her children to school. She is the only one who supports the family through snack vending in offices, also having a part-time job at the hospital as a janitress. \r\n\r\nChange of governance was the cause for which she was terminated at the hospital where she worked for two years. Afterwards, she decided to have a small sari-sari store (general store) with a starting capital of two thousand pesos. In September 2001, a friend told her about Paglaum MPC: its program and services rendered to the members. She did not hesitate to join Paglaum MPC; she attended the membership seminar and became a bonafide member, too. \r\n\r\nFrom that time on, she requested loans as additional working capital for her sari-sari business.  As of now she is on her 26th loan amounting to Twenty thousand pesos. For the past loans, her good performance in repayment is highly appreciated. In such a way, she was able to send her children to school so that they have successfully finished their studies and have their respective jobs now. Lately, her daughters got married. Only one son and one daughter are still living with her. Future plans for the family are to have a decent house to live in, a bigger sari-sari store building, and adequate savings for her old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":230390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional grocery items for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2008-11-26T19:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzvilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.02,"local_amount":1,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5343528,"comment":null},{"amount":32.66,"local_amount":1537,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5343529,"comment":null},{"amount":304.09,"local_amount":14310,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":14898.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14881402,"comment":null},{"amount":17.83,"local_amount":839,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":873.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53000751,"comment":null},{"amount":70.4,"local_amount":3313,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3449.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63222787,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-27T10:41:06Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T17:33:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76173,"name":"Hom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hom U. is 25 years old.

Yalcou\u00e9, age 40, lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and seven children (four boys and three girls) in Banconi, one of the outlying districts of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having tried several kinds of work without success, she opted to become initiated eight years ago in the commerce of 'Wax' pagnes (highly prized cloth in West Africa), embroidered fabrics, bedsheets, and 'Super'  basins.  She works at the marketplace of her district in Sikasso where she is in high demand by her customers, thanks to the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After five solidarity loans (group loans) with a women's association of her district (Association Benkadi de Banconi), she is now on her fourth individual loan.  All of the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy:  10 lengths of 'Wax' pagnes, 10 sets of embroidered fabrics, 10 sets of sheets, and 10 sets of 'Super' basins.   She gets her supplies in Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso from wholesalers by special order.  She sells her goods, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed essentially of women.  Concurrent to this principal commerce, she works in the service sector, specifically dressmaking.  She sews clothing for her neighbors and customers, who provide her with revenues that cover her main expenses. \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 120,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":230438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy 'Wax' pagnes, embroidered fabrics, bedsheets, and 'Super' basins  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hadiaratou Yalcoue","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974115,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889491,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440284,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135652,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033453,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620820,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T07:20:16Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76203,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen N. is 43 years of age and happily married to Romulo, a resident of Macalibre Alto, Lopez Jaena.

stay up very late. \r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 100,000 which will mainly be used to increase her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn,

In order to catch more fish, Mrs. Sokkhorn R. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets for her husband\u2019s business. Mrs. Sokkhorn R. is 24 years old and the mother of two children, ages 2 and 4.\r\n \r\nFour members of this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with end-of-term (EoT) loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. These loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She lives in the house of her late husband with their children (three boys and one girl) in Mancourani Natien, a busy neighborhood of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali\u2019s third administrative region).\r\nFrom a very young age she became involved in income-generating businesses, particularly the buying and selling of dried fish from Senegal commonly known as \u201cyayi boyi.\u201d She has been doing this for 20 years now.\r\nYayi boyi is a very prized fish which is used in West African cuisine. In addition to her main business of buying and selling \u201cyayi boyi,\u201d she runs a business buying and selling incense.\r\nShe operates out of Sikasso\u2019s main market where she is much in demand and appreciated due to the quality of her products. \r\nTo satisfy her ever-increasing clientele, she decided, just five months ago, to rejoin the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is on her first individual loan. \r\nShe plans to use this first loan to buy 4 metric tons of \"yayi boyi\" dried fish in Dakar (Senegal) from wholesalers who sell to order.\r\nShe makes her own sales for cash or on credit to a clientele made up of women (from the city and especially stall holders). \r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 100,000 which will mainly be used to increase her working capital, contribute towards the family expenses and pay the interest on the loan.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 42-year-old Kisa Kasanga from Mbeya. She is single with two children, ages 3 and 6. <p>\r\n\r\nKisa has been running an ice cream business since 2001. Selling ice cream is big business in Tanzania as the temperature here is HOT HOT HOT!!  There is no typical type of ice cream stand in Tanzania.  You will find people selling ice cream in little trolleys on the beach and along the streets, in deep freezers in convenience stores, and right inside people\u2019s homes.  However, they all offer a wide variety of delights from smoothie popsicles to chocolate dipped ice cream, some local and some brand names.  No matter what or where you purchase these tasty treats, they always bring a smile and a sense of relief from the constant Tanzanian sun.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week. Kisa currently earns about 134 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD to purchase a deep freezer in order to keep her ice cream cool. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Kisa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":230463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Edna D., 32 years old and married, originally lived in Macalibre Alto, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. At present their family has moved to Miputak, Dipolog City and started up their \"lechon\" (roasted pig) business.  \r\n\r\nAs they are blessed with 5 children, their income can hardly meet the demands of everyday living. \"Lechon\" is well-known among Filipinos because of its delectable taste and can be served for all occasions. These are the very reasons why they took up the \"lechon\" business. Beating the odds like no existing clients and new to the community, the difficulty of obtaining capital is truly a mountain to survive.  And so, aside from \"lechon\" orders, they also cater \"lechon\" roasting where customers only pay for the labor.\r\n\r\nEdna joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative in 2005 at the Plaridel Branch and later on transferred her membership to the Dipolog Branch because of their desire to start up their own business in the city. They rented a space for PHP 3,000 monthly and crossed their fingers that their \"lechon\" business would be a success. Paglaum MPC serves to help them access additional capital.  Recently, they have requested PHP 14,000. \r\n\r\nMrs. D. plans to acquire land for a business site and expand their \"lechon\" business into other areas. She also wants to see her children finish their

He lives with his family, which includes six children. As many people in rural areas do, he practices agriculture. For 11 years his family's primary source of income has been growing wheat.

She has been living in this city for the past 33 years. She is the mother of five sons. Her elder son is a painter of doors and windows of houses, the next son makes jewelry boxes, the next works in an army, and her younger sons are in 8th Standard. Parveen baji\u2019s husband has a wood selling business. He has been selling wood for the past 10 years. Parveen baji herself has a thread selling business. She gets thread from old warm clothes. First she pulls the thread out from sweaters and then washes and dries it. At the end she makes a roll of that thread and sells it in shops for profit. She doesn\u2019t care about the pain she takes in the process of thread selling because she focuses only on the profit that she wants to earn. She successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy more warm clothes and sweaters in order to sell more thread. \r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan group by a few more members. Bilquis baji wants a loan to buy wood to resell. Sheeman baji wants a loan to buy scrap (plastic bottles and waste papers) for her scrap business. Shakeela naz baji wants a loan to buy iron for her scrap business. Farzana baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

His monthly net profit is about $ 300. Today, Razzok is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni (1200 USD) for the term of 12 months to increase his stock. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. One of his dreams is that his children progress in their studies. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.

Because she buys apricots wholesale, her prices are lower than regular market prices. \r\n\r\nShe offers a wide assortment of dried apricots for clients. All this allows Mamlakatjon to make her business quite successful and it brings a consistently stable income for her family. Today, Mamlakatjon requests 2000 Somoni (600 USD) for the term of eight months. She is going to spend the loan to purchase dried apricots and to process them and to sell.

The main activity is fishing. However, being fishermen by trade, we are confronted with different difficulties to carry through our activity. The scarcity of fish, to name one among others, is forcing us to go further and further from the coasts to fish.  This requires high quality equipment. This state of affair brings on poverty that in turn engenders illegal immigration, emptying our village of its youth. The goal of this loan is to equip ourselves with a dugout canoe in order to have better and more adequate equipment  for our work. This by the same token would give permanent employment to the young fishermen of the group. The activity is fishing and the sale of products from the sea. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva

Since she was a very young girl she has worked in agriculture, when she finishs her activities in the field she works in crafts, making tapestries, blankets, etc. What she likes most is agriculture, which is why she does not stop cultivating, and above all she sees potato sales as very profitable.  This time she is planting 20 sacks of seed and in lesser quantities grows \"olluco\", \"oca\",  and other products. But the potato is for what she obtains greater earnings.  The difficulty is the increase in the price of fertilizers and without them her fields do not produce as they should.  This is her loan number 7 with MFP, she has been punctual in all of her installmentes.With the quantity that she has requested she will buy fertilizers such as nitrate, potassium and 18, which will cost her 1.800 soles.

Norma is a schoolteacher, but she is not paid enough to live on, so she also sells dry goods (rice, sugar, flour) at the local Sunday market. When she first started it was tough, since people gossiped about her having to have two jobs, but she says she has gotten past that. In the beginning, her husband didn't want to let her go out to the market to work as a vendor, but once he realized she was earning money he started to help her. Today, Norma says that her business has grown a lot since she started working with FINCA, and her husband is now very understanding. She has developed a better relationship with her family, too. Norma is requesting a loan of 600 soles (US$200) to buy a wider variety of merchandise to sell at her market stall. Norma's dream is to buy a car and for her children to graduate with professional degrees. \n\nMartina is married with two children who are 18 and 12 years old. Martina sells lamb soup and chicken soup in local markets, and also sells at meetings of the \"Juntos\" program. She has increased her sales since she started selling soup at these meetings, since she used to just work at markets. Martina is requesting a loan of 600 soles to buy more lamb to make soup to bring to other local markets. She says that FINCA has taught her good values and how to be responsible with herself and her family.

Valle Hermoso Ccayarpachi is currently in its fifth loan cycle with FINCA. The group members live in the Ccayarpachi community in the province of Huamanga, in central Peru. The community is on the right hand siD. of the Cachi River, in a warm climate. The region produces many fruits and vegetables; many locals also raise large and small animals like cows, pigs, and guinea pigs (a delicacy in Peru). \n\nTeodosia and Hermelina are two members of Valle Hermoso Ccayarpachi. \n\nTeodosia is married with four children, who are 11, 9, 6 and 4 years old and are all in school. She runs a small store, which she opened by gradually saving up the money she earned from selling the animals she raised. Teodosia now hopes to open up a larger store in her own home, which she recently finished building. Teodosia is requesting a loan of 800 soles (US$275) to buy a variety of merchandise to sell in the store she plans to open. Teodosia says that loans from FINCA have helped her expand her business. In the future, she hopes to raise her own pigs and guinea pigs in addition to running the store. She also wants her children to study in the city of Ayacucho, where the schools are higher quality. She says she is saving money in her FINCA account in case her family ever has any trouble or emergency situations. \n\nHermelina is married with five children who are 28, 25, 18, 14 and 13 years old. She sells chicken, fish and vegetables in Ccayarpachi, and has been in this business for the past 15 years. Hermelina is requesting a loan of 400 soles (US $150) to buy more merchandise to sell so that she can earn more.

prices.\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy 2 quintals (one quintal is 46kg) of sugar at US$30 per quintal, 2 quintals of flour at US$50 per quintal, 2 cases of butter at US$25 per case, 2 cases of shortening at US$30 per case, 1 drum of oil at US$35 per drum, 10 sacks of charcoal at US$3 per sack, 2 cases of yeast at US$35 per case, 100 coconuts at US$0.20 per coconut, and an industrial stove costing US$20.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

Cayara Village Bank is part of FINCA Peru\u2019s Project Wari, an effort to bring micro-loans to rural communities in central Peru. The group is maD. up of 18 members from the Ayacucho region\u2019s Cayara community, who are together requesting loans of $2025 (6200 PEN). The town is located an hour from Huancapi District, on the highway to Southern Ayacucho. The community has three different elevations: a low part suited to growing fruit, a middle ground suited to growing grains, and an elevated section suited to growing tubers, namely potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nDina, Reyna Marta, and Eufemia are three members of the San Juan Bautista D. Cayara Village Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nDina is married but separated with two children who are 6 and 12 years old and currently attend school. Dina sells dry goods from a small stO., and would like to expand her businesses and sell ground grains. She is requesting a loan of $65 (200 PEN), which she plans to use to buy grains, whole and ground, to bring to the Canaria Mine to sell. She is grateful to work with FINCA; she says it provides a good opportunity to save and to continue to expand her business. Her goals for the future are to proviD. her children with a good education, improve her business, and get ahead in life. She is saving for her children\u2019s education. \r\n<p>\r\nReyna Marta is married and has three children who are 7, 9, and 12 years old. Reyna sells sweets outsiD. several local schools. She also sells lunch to teachers and to workers who are installing an irrigation canal in her community. She is requesting a loan of $65 (200 PEN) to buy mO. sweets to sell and start running her lunch counter from a kiosk in the town\u2019s main plaza. Reyna\u2019s dream is to move her family to a city with mO. opportunities and open up a business in the city of Huamanga. FINCA has helped her save money for herself and for her children. Like Dina, Reyna is saving up for her children\u2019s education. She says her husband plans to start saving, too. \r\n<p>\r\nEufemia lives with her partner and their three children, who are 1, 4, and 9 years old and are all in school. She is involved in Cayara\u2019s local government, and also runs a small stO. and sells household supplies. She is requesting a loan of $200 (600 PEN), which she will use to buy mO. products for her stO. and to help jump-start her savings. Eufemia says that when she first heard that FINCA was coming to Cayara she didn\u2019t believe it, but it did indeed come, and is helping community members to save, which she likes. Eufemia says that her businesses are doing well, and she knows she will get ahead in life. Eufemia dreams that her children will go to college someday. She wants to leave her village to proviD. her children with a better education. Like Dina and Reyna, she is saving up for her children\u2019s education. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":230711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy grains, buy sweets and open a lunch counter, and buy household supplies to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Primitiva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6200,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.29},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.29},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.29},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1033.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":337.49,"local_amount":1033.29,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932861,"comment":null},{"amount":337.49,"local_amount":1033.29,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932862,"comment":null},{"amount":337.49,"local_amount":1033.29,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215127,"comment":null},{"amount":337.49,"local_amount":1033.29,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396840,"comment":null},{"amount":337.49,"local_amount":1033.29,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088517,"comment":null},{"amount":337.55,"local_amount":1033.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981954,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T17:44:08Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76379,"name":"Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" La se\u00f1ora  Cristina, es una mujer joven y bonita que se dedica a vender  ropas y calzados adem\u00e1s de algunos electrodom\u00e9stico.\n\nYa van varios a\u00f1os que se dedica a este oficio por lo que ya tiene su propia clientela formada.

Now that his parents are old, they are thinking about leaving the bread shop to him so that he can carry on the family tradition. However, he has demonstrated little interest to take on this task because he has liked to fix radios, televisions, etc. since he was very young. Because of this, he realized that his career should be in fixing electronics. For many years, he worked as an assistant in a small rented workshop in the North zone of the city.

Accordingly, each member took part in many meetings and workshops to develop their respective business plans. <p>\r\n\r\nCasilda is the representative of this group. She plans on operating a small business in her neighborhood where she will sell clothing, but she hopes to have her own store someday. She notes that she has always been a good seamstress, and that she has made clothing for her children. As a result, she will utilize these skills to create a successful business because she feels that she can truly excel in this field. She is a very hard-working woman, and she is extremely excited about this opportunity. She dreams of sending her children to college, and she wants nothing more than to give her children a chance to break out of poverty. Indeed, she wants to give her children every opportunity possible: this is the first step in reaching that dream, and she is ready to take the step!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":230770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To start

Cayara (\u201cThe Little Bees of Cayara\u201d) Village Bank is part of FINCA Peru\u2019s Project Wari, an effort to bring micro-loans to rural communities in central Peru. The group is maD. up of 22 women who live in the Cayara community of the Ayacucho District of central Peru. Cayara is located an hour from the Huancapi District, on the highway to Southern Ayacucho. The community has three different elevations: a low part, near the Pampos River suited to growing fruit, a middle ground suited to growing grains, and an elevated section suited to growing tubers, namely potatoes. Local women also produce woven blankets. <p>\r\n\r\nPalomina, Holinda and Edith are three members of Las Abejitas. <p>\r\n\r\nPalomina is married and has five children, all under the age of 18. She weaves blankets, does embroidery, and sells clothing. She makes frequent trips to the local jail to buy blankets maD. by prisoners, then she embroiders the blankets and sells them. P. is requesting a loan of 300 soles to buy mO. blankets to embroider for the New Year\u2019s and Carnaval season. <p>\r\n\r\nPalomina\u2019s family is still in the process of overcoming difficulties suffered during the Shining Path era. She says that working with FINCA has given her hope and allowed her to start saving money for her children\u2019s future. Her dream in life is to get ahead in life, along with her children; she wants them all to graduate with professional degrees, and she would like to open a small grocery stO. of her own.<p>\r\n\r\nHolinda is married with two children, who are four and eight years old. Holinda produces and sells honey, bee pollen and syrup. She takes advantage of business opportunities she sees to sell fruit or other wares at local markets. Holinda is requesting a loan of 200 soles to buy an extractor (a machine used to extract honey from frames of honeycomb) for her bee farm. She says she has been able to improve her apiary with better materials and tools thanks to help from FINCA. Holinda\u2019s goals for the future are to produce mO. honey and honey-derived products.  \r\n\r\nEdith is married with one three-year-old child. She buys and sells grains in her area and also brings some to the Canaria Mine to sell. She is requesting a loan of 200 soles to buy mO. grains to sell, including new types she hasn\u2019t sold befO.. Edith says that when FINCA came to Cayara, she felt as though God had heard the prayers of local women and provided them with an opportunity. Her dream for the future is to improve her business and to help her son get ahead. She is saving in order to open the door to new opportunities and break out of her current routine.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":230794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy honey extractor, blankets and grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-11-26T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Sunilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Holinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eutropia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina Marlena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Magna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Mauricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.29},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.29},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.29},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":366.65},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":366.65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":366.65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":366.65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":366.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":733.44,"local_amount":2267,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2267.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932863,"comment":null},{"amount":366.52,"local_amount":1132.87,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215128,"comment":null},{"amount":366.65,"local_amount":1133.29,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396841,"comment":null},{"amount":366.65,"local_amount":1133.29,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088518,"comment":null},{"amount":366.74,"local_amount":1133.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981955,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-27T00:11:54Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76427,"name":"Ilmer","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ilmer pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Divinas\u201d, ubicado en el Jr. Trujillo N\u00ba 252-A, distrito D.

She is requesting a loan of 2000 soles to buy more gifts for her store. <[>\r\n\r\nCarmen's dream is to buy a house in Lima to live in with all of her children. Most of them live in Lima in rented apartments, and she would prefer they had a home of their own.

She has three children, and is 34 years old. She completed secondary school. She rents a cafeteria in the district's center. Business is good, but the facility needs repairs.

The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mr. Thy S. is the village bank president, selected by the members. He is 29 years old and the father of two children who are enrolled in the local school. He is a farmer who owns a piece of land where he cultivates both rice and vegetables to earn his living. His wife, Mrs. Kong Chrean, is a pig breeder. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand it; thus, they decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets for breeding. They hope to increase their income and improve their living conditions with this loan. \r\n\r\nAll the members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Felipe enjoys attending to people and likes that while the store takes up a lot of his time the work itself is not physically demanding. With his dedication, Felipe's business has become profitable and because it is one of the few stores in the community, it has been relatively easy to build up a faithful client base. On the other hand, the most difficult aspect of his business is that he has to buy his supplies from the nearest city and transport them back to his community.
