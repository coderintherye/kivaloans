In her business she yields an average profitability of 49.6%, from which she plans her gradual growth in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1001579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy basic materials in larger quantities, such as cloth, yarn, thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72748},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78528},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80361},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82236},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84155},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88128},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90184},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92288},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94442},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96645},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T03:41:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389720,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly tiene 40 a\u00f1os, dedicada con mucho amor a su esposo Marcelino de 54 a\u00f1os y sus 06 hijos, viven en su propia casa ubicada en la comunidad de Palmapampa.

She sells artisanal crafts such as backpacks and hats, among others. She knows that every season, there is a star product, and since carnival is approaching, she is working on the exhibition of the famous San Jacinteros hats. However, her working capital is insufficient for responding to her supply plan. That is the reason that she has turned to a Kiva loan, the eighth loan she has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy hats, which she will exhibit at her business, and which usually sell at a good price, obtaining good earnings. During the 10 years that she has been benefitting form loans from this organization, she has been able to increase her inventory, improve her locale, etc. Her goal for the future is to put sliding doors in her business to increase security and achieve a more comfortable environment that invites customers in to buy her products.

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Andrea is a very good client with a good credit history.  She has a business selling clothing and shoes in an itinerant manner.  She does this work along with her beloved husband.  They take their products throughout all of the valley, from their town to as far as Puerto Ene. For them, this work begins on Wednesdays when they go around to many towns, looking for a good quantity of customers in each town to whom they can sell their products.  Also, the people who already know them always buy their garments, because they offer them for sale at an affordable price.  Before doing this kind of work, Andrea used to sell vegetables, which was also profitable, but this business had the disadvantage that the products were very perishable.  This is why she switched to selling clothing.  In the future, she is thinking of renting a sales stall in the same town of Pichari, so that she would not have to travel from one place to another to sell her clothing, because this is very arduous work.  This is the second loan that she has taken with MFP, and so she promises once more to make all of her scheduled payments.  Andrea is happy and content with her communal bank, because everyone in the group is punctual with their payments.

She lives together with Aurelio, age 57, with whom she has six children. She provided her children with education and raised them with good manners and good habits. She lives in her own house where she is now working hard to provide security for her old age. Every day, Doli gets up very early and takes care of the household chores. Once she has everything fixed up at home, she goes out to the market and buys well-chosen and fresh ingredients which she will use to prepare food. She has been doing this work for six years. She sells her meals from her home, and many people come each day in search of a plate of delicious and well-served food the way she knows how to provide it. She enjoys having this work very much, because it allows her to have control over her time during the day, since she only sells at night. During her years of work, she has been able to attract customers thanks to her good service, always provided with a smile. Now she has good sales and thus a good income. She hopes to continue to grow and expand with more tables and chairs to provide more comfort to her customers. This will be her eighth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, since it lets her feel more secure in moving ahead with her business. At the same time, she is committed once again to fulfilling her payment schedule, as in her previous loans. She is also very grateful to be working with the members of her communal bank, since all of them are very responsible and have a strong sense of solidarity. With the amount she is requesting, 3000 Peruvian soles, she will buy ingredients and supplies to continue with her work, in addition to improving her business with more tables and chairs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.31,"image":{"id":1001633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to prepare more food, as well as tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":438.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":478.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":496.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":551.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":164.31,"local_amount":438.17,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":441.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T21:22:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389771,"name":"Macaes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Macaes est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Karen Auxiliadora de 25 a\u00f1os quien tiene una pulper\u00eda.

When Trinidad saw that the village had transportation difficulties, she decided to dedicate herself to transporting cattle and also to bringing essential goods for selling in her community. The cattle she took was slaughtered and soon sold. Meanwhile, she kept another group for breeding. In time, she was able to get a vehicle that makes transportation easier and saves time.

She has been in this line of work for 10 years and she does it alone, because she has learned to get things done without help from anyone. During her years of work, she has learned a lot, such as how to approach customers and how to convince them to buy an article. She's very thankful to be doing well, because she's aware that it takes a lot of work in order to succeed in this business. She hopes to be able to continue working hard and to expand into a cosmetics store where she can get better profits.

They work constantly from 7:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon.  Their only goal is to advance with the work they have so that their products are able to come to better fruition.  They want this so that they will then get benefits that meet their needs.\r\n\r\nHilaria usually works with the help of her beloved husband.  However, during the harvesting season she always turns to help from day workers who make it easier to extract her products.

They have a small house in the T\u00facume district, which is 45 minutes from the Chiclayo province in the Lambayaque department.  The place where Maria lives is a district on the road to development, and it already has the basic services needed.  The settlement where she lives is one of the many that is devoted to livestock and farming.\r\n\r\nEvery day Maria devotes herself to raising and later selling animals like cows, and sheep.  She also raises poultry like ducks, turkeys, and guinea pigs, among others.  She has always done this work, having spent approximately 20 years at it.  She inherited the business from her parents, who taught her about buying and selling animals when she was very young.  She has been able to set up strategic spaces for raising animals at her own house.  The union between her son and her husband has made them undertake new family objectives.  That is why they work every day in order to achieve their objectives and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nUpon having clear and established objectives, Maria wishes to buy husked rice and balanced feed, which will serve to fatten the animals.\r\n\r\nMaria has requested a loan for 1,500 soles from Edpyme Alternativa.  The loan will help her generate more income, with which they will be able to improve their quality of life and pay for the requested loan.\r\n\r\nMaria has been enterprising ever since she was young thanks to the values her parents instilled in her.  Her neighbors know she has these values, and they greatly admire her for always worrying about her family\u2019s well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":51.56,"image":{"id":1001796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Por el momento no cuenta con fondos para dicha inversi\u00f3n por lo que ha tomado la decisi\u00f3n de acudir a INTEGRAL para solicitar este cr\u00e9dito e invertir en la compra de variedad de verduras al por mayor (zanahorias, tomates, papas, cebollas, chiles, g\u00fcisquiles, etc.) que le permitan atraer a m\u00e1s clientes y por consecuencia mejores ingresos que le conlleven a lograr su sue\u00f1o.\n","en":"Norma Dalila is 32 years old and lives together with her two children who are 11 and 8 years old.  Her children are both currently in school.  Norma's business is selling vegetables in the town market in her area.  She is very well known because she always has a variety of fresh vegetables at a good price.  She is an incredible woman who works hard to provide her children with their daily bread.  Every day, she gets up very early in the morning to go and buy her vegetables from the central market in the country's capital city because there she has access to a large variety of fresh vegetables at very good prices.  Her dream is to provide her children with better living conditions than those she had.  She does not lose hope of seeing her children become professionals.  Norma is not unconcerned by her financial situation as things are becoming increasingly difficult and needs are increasing over time.  This has led her to take the decision to invest in her business so that she will have the ability to deal with greater demand.  This will allow her to keep her business active for longer, given that it is her main source of income.  Right now, Norma does not have the money she needs to make this investment.  For this reason, she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying a variety of vegetables wholesale (carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.)  This will allow her to attract more customers and thereby make more income with which to achieve her dream."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":34.03,"image":{"id":1002184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Dalila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.03,"local_amount":34.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T19:37:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391438,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 44-year-old married man.

He sells his spices as an itinerant vendor in different nearby areas.  He has been in this business for three years and his results have been very favorable as they have allowed him to provide his household with their daily bread.  Alcides is very hard-working and responsible.  Many people buy his products as he offers good quality, hygiene and good prices.

He lives in the city of Ica, in the district of Santiago. This city is known for its warm climate and agriculture, especially crops like cotton, asparagus and grapes, all of which are exported to different countries around the world by the generosity of those inhabitants.

He adores them as they are his reason to live.\r\n\r\nJose drives a mototaxi and provides transportation to the people of the city. He rents the mototaxi and gets up early in the morning to take advantage of the whole day since he has to return the vehicle at a determined hour. He works about 11 hours a day, but he also works all day on Sunday because the owner of the mototaxi offered it to him. Jose takes advantage of it to make a little extra cash.
