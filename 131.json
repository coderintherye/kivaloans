The other three attend school, while the youngest one is only four years old.

Twelve members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to repay. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Juraboy is 52 years old. He is married with 2 children. From the time he was young, Juraboy has learned to work in the family business from his parents. With a lot of sacrifice, he has become a major producer of agriculture in the area where he lives. After he married, he continued working in the same business, watching the business grow as a result of his sacrifice, and saw his family progress more and more. With the income he was able to open a dispensary in his house and raise the cattle successfully.

After 3 months, she gained a profit of VND 200,000. As a laborious woman, she continued borrowing to invest in raising pigs and plant some kinds of fruit tree. As she did these businesses, she also leant more experience from other people. That is why after joining TYM for 5 years, her businesses have improved and she now has an income of VND 2 million per month. In addition, her husband contributes his salary to the family's income, which makes her family's economy stable.

is the third time that Mrs. Chet V. has asked for a loan to improve her living conditions.  She is a teacher in Soben (Dream) Village in Kampong Chhnang Province, and she can make $30 per month which is very little to support her family. Aside from this, she is a pig breeder. Her husband, Mr. Pok Samorn, is a government officer in the Tax Department in the provincial town. Mrs. Chet V.'s neighbor wants to sell a piece of land at a reasonable price, so Mrs. Chet V. wants to buy it to then resell later at a better price. Therefore, she decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings, and achieve this goal.

Selain membantu suaminya Wayan Lungguh bekerja sebagai petani, Ketut Sitri juga memelihara babi di belakang rumahnya. Setelah bergabung di kelompok Kembang Mekar dan mengajukan pinjaman pertama ke DINARI, Ketut membeli satu ekor induk babi disamping 3 ekor bibit penggemukan yang sudah dimilikinya. Selain itu sisa pinjaman juga digunakan untuk membeli pakan babi. Setelah 5 bulan dipelihara Ketut menjual anak-anak babi dari induk peliharaanya dan berhasil mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 200.000,- per bulannya. Itu belum termasuk keuntungan dari penjualan 3 ekor babi penggemukan modalnya sendiri. Selanjutnya pada pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu sama yaitu 6 bulan, Ketut akan menambah 4 ekor bibit penggemukan dan tetap memelihara induknya juga. Nantinya dengan penambahan populasi babi ini akan diperoleh hasil yang lebih bagus lagi dari sebelumnya sehingga pinjaman DINARI juga bisa dikembalikan pada akhir periode pinjaman dan bisa segera dilanjutkan lagi dengan pinjaman selanjutnya. Karena hasil dari beternak babi ini sangat menjanjikan bagi Ketut Sitri dalam meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya.","en":"Ni Ketut Sitri is a very diligent housewife.

sudah pas-pasan. Disamping juga harus mencukupi kebutuhan lainnya. Suaminya yang hanya seorang petani dengan hasil yang tidak terlalu banyak membuat Komang harus ikut berusaha mendukung ekonomi keluarga. Untuk itulah Komang berusaha dengan memelihara babi di rumahnya dan masuk anggota kelompok ternak Kembang Mekar. Dengan modal sendiri serta pinjaman dari DINARI, Komang mampu membeli 3 ekor induk babi dimana setelah 6 bulan memelihara induk babi tersebut menghasilkan masing-masing 5-6 ekor anak babi. Setelah dijual keuntungan yang diperoleh setelah dipotong biaya pakannya mencapai Rp. 1.500.000,- dalam kurun waktu 6 bulan. Melihat hasil yang bagus ini, Komang melanjutkan ke pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan juga dan rencananya akan dibelikan pakan yang lebih berkualitas bagi 3 ekor induk babinya tersebut sehingga anak-anak babi yang dihasilkan akan bertambah banyak dan berkualitas bagus. Program pinjaman ke peternak babi dari DINARI dengan pelunasan pinjaman pada akhir periode di bulan ke 6 ini dirasakan sangat menolong Komang Wenti untuk mengembangkan usahanya dan hasilnya sangat membantu Komang untuk menyekolahkan anak-anaknya.","en":"Komang Wenti needs to afford tuition for her 3 daughters, two are in school already.  She also needs to pay for her daily living expenses.  Her husband is a farmer with uncertain and limited income.  Komang is compelled to help her family's finances by farming pigs in her backyard.  With her own money and additional loan from DINARI, Komang managed to purchase 3 breeding pigs.  After 6 months, they produced 6 piglets that was sold for $150 profit in 6 months.  After this encouraging result, she was encouraged to seek second loan from DINARI that she will use to purchase higher quality feeds for her 3 breeders, so they produce higher quality piglets.  She feels that DINARI's flexible loan structure helps tremendously in developing her business.  She plans to use the additional profit to pay her daughters' tuition.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":203690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-21T03:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wenti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-05T06:13:20Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-23T08:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308586,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849809,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080636,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973846,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-21T06:13:20Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65430,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Heng L. was born in 1950 and now lives in Preak Thom Village in Kandal Province.

bersantai-santai dengan kesehariannya. Kebutuhan hidup yang semakin meningkat mendorong Ketut untuk bekerja lebih keras membantu suaminya yang seorang karyawan swasta dengan gaji yang pas-pasan. Disamping mengolah ladangnya, Ketut juga memelihara babi di rumahnya dan ikut dalam aktifitas kelompok ternak Kembang Mekar di desanya. Dengan meminjam ke DINARI lewat program KIVA, Ketut mampu membeli 1 ekor induk babi serta pakannya yang kemudian dipeliharanya selama 6 bulan menghasilkan keuntungan Rp. 500.000 dari penjualan 6 ekor anak babinya. Karena keuntungan yang lumayan bagus, Ketut melanjutkan ke pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu yang sama yaitu 6 bulan dan kembali dibelikannya 1 ekor induk babi serta sisanya untuk pakan. Sekarang Ketut berhasil memelihara 2 ekor induk babi dan selama 6 bulan kedepan besar harapan Ketut untuk menghasilkan anak babi yang lebih banyak lagi sebab para pembeli bibit sudah menantinya. Pinjaman ini nantinya akan dikembalikan pada akhir masa pinjaman. Hasil yang dicapai Ketut sangat membantu keuangan keluarganya sehingga keperluan dan biaya sekolah anaknya pun bisa terpenuhi.","en":"Being a young mother whose child sits in first grade, Ketut Sumarmi cannot be lazy.  Ever rising living cost motivates Ketut to work hard to help her husband who works as a private employee with barely sufficient salary.  Besides workin gin her rice field, Ketut also farms pigs in her home through Kembang Mekar group.  Through a loan from Kiva channeled through DINARI, Ketut bought a breeder pig and feeds.  She bred the pig for 6 months and earned $50 profit from the sale of 6 piglets.  Due to the excellent result, Ketut is requesting a second loan with 6 month tenor to purchase additional breeder pig and feeds.  With the 2 breeding pigs, Ketut hopes to produce more piglets in the next 6 month that can be sold ot her regular clients.  The profit from her farm will be used to supplement her family's finances and pay her child's tuition.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":203693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase breeder pig an feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-21T03:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Sumarmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-05T06:13:21Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-23T08:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308587,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849810,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080637,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973847,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-21T06:13:21Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65432,"name":"Thuok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thuok P. is a villager in Preak Thom Village in Kandal Province and she is a vegetable farmer.

Wayan is hopeful that she can earn more profit from more pigs.  She will use the additional profit to help her family's daily finances and raise her kids.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":203696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purhcase pigs and feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-21T03:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Pori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-05T04:43:06Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-23T08:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308588,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849811,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":539828.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080638,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":269914.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973848,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-21T04:43:06Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":65435,"name":"Farmer Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Vat K.

Meanwhile they are helping their father in their spare time.<P>\r\n\r\nA few months ago, Noor has decided to buy a car to use as a taxi for his son and some equipment for his shop, because he wants to pave the way for his other three sons to just keep at their studying. For this purpose, he needs to expand his business more and increase his daily income. This was the reason that he requested  a 50,000 Afghani individual loan from AFSG , to make his dreams come true.<P>\r\n\r\nFinally Noor M. hopes the lenders will provide this opportunity for him, to utilize his capability.
