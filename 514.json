It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a skilled seamstress. She lives and works in Kurgantyube, Tajikistan, and offers tailoring services.  Mukaramkhon is married and her husband is very supportive of her business endeavors, which is also her greatest hobby. All her products are very well sewn and are relatively affordable, which is why Mukaramkhon's services are always in good demand. \r\n\r\nMukaramkhon has been in this business for 25 years and has learned some valuable lessons, overcoming challenges and hard times. Her business has another big advantage in that it provides jobs for other people, helping fight the high unemployment rate which has always been a problem in Tajikistan. \r\n\r\nMukaramkhon is seeking a loan of $1700 USD to purchase sewing machines and accessories to improve the quality of items she offers for sale, and to facilitate some working procedures for her employees.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have 6 children but only 3 still live with them: 23 year-old Joel, 12 year-old Pa\u00fal and 8 year-old Isabel.  They live together as a family in their own home which is located in the town of Ricrican.  Elizabet's business is farming.  Her main crops are potatoes, peas and olluco (a tuber).  She has been in this business for 20 years and, as a good farming woman, she very much enjoys plowing her land. \r\n\r\nThe care that Elizabet takes of her land ensures that that her harvests receive a good price in the different cities where they are sold, in Tarma, Huaral where she takes her potato seed to sell.  However, in spite of her success in farming, Elizabeth also works buying and selling mutton.  For the future success of her businesses, she would like to continue improving her crops and open a grocery store in her home.  She is certain that she will achieve this with the help of her elder daughters who went to Argentina some time ago.

They had 5 children together, but only 2 of them still live with her: Nora, who is 18, and Cand\u00ed, 16. They live as a family in their own house, located in the Ricrican area. This brave woman dedicates her time to growing potatoes, yams and other tubers. What she likes best about her work is when she comes down from her farmlands to the city, where she can sell her harvest for a good price. Dedicaci\u00f3n goes on to say that when she goes to the city of Tarma, apart from selling her nutritious potatoes, she also sells mutton. With the proceeds from the sale she can buy food for the week. She thanks God for all the support she has recieved, and despite the hard work the farm represents, she is happy that she has something of her own and is able to hold onto it for her children. This is her 11th loan from [field partner] MFP, and as a long-standing member of her communal bank, she hopes to continue working and developing the same. With the sum she is looking to borrow, she will buy sacks of organic fertilizer, and - if she has sufficient funds - she will invest in chemicals to control the insect pests that constantly plague her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":664253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer and chemicals to control insect infestations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-13T22:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dedicaci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349900,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-14T01:52:58Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":257689,"name":"Jose Sipriano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el se\u00f1or Jose D. tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el barrio san francisco de la ciudad de Choluteca y se dedica a prestar los servicios de moler maiz, tiene un motor para moler maiz, brinda sus servicios a la mayoria de las personas que viven en ese barrio, se levanta todos los dias a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana para poder cubrir con todas las molidas de maiz.\nJose es bien trabajador, responsable y honrado, se esfuerza mucho para seguir creciendo con su negocio.\nel credito lo utilizara para la compra de repuestos para darle un mantenimiento al motor.\nahorita tiene  mucha demanda ya que muchas personas estan moliendo bastante maiz para elaborar nacatamales.","en":"Se\u00f1or Jose D., age 55, lives in the San Francisco neighbourhood in the city of Choluteca.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amelia A. is from the village of Santo Domingo in Luna municipality, Isabela province. She is 49 years old. Amelia is the group leader of a four-member group applying for a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAmelia is married and has two school-age children. To make a living, Amelia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Amelia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP when she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Amelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 22000 PHP from ASKI. Amelia is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Amelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":664464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock feed and other supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

D. A. is a married woman who lives in 110, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a food-vending business and a farm. Her husband, Cornelio, who is 58 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 21 and 40 years old. \r\n\r\nDelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, with which she intends to buy stock for the general store and fertilizers for her rice and corn plantation so that she can continue to save for future improvements to the businesses. \r\n\r\nDelia D. A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. is a married woman who lives in 111, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sugarcane plantation and rice field. Her husband, John Glenn, who is 42 years old, works as a heavy equipment operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.They have three children who are between 7 and 19 years old. \r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 16600, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 24500, which she intends to use for additional capital for the sugarcane plantation so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nNenita G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

It was a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 37 years old. Genelyn is the group leader of a 13-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGenelyn is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Genelyn owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Genelyn has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Genelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Genelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Genelyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Genelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue she generates to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":664545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for two years already. Currently she is earning at least 8,000 PHP per month from the sales of her business. \r\n\r\nJust this year, Helen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Helen, as a newly recognized member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program, is now requesting a loan of 50,000 PHP as her first loan availment, which will be used for additional capital for her existing RTW and direct selling business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

C. is from the village of Usocan. She is 54 years old. Jerilyn is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over thirty years and earns approximately $345 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jerilyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. \r\n\r\nJerilyn is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 9th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Usocan, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Fe is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Fe owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Fe is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Fe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Leonora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials for house completion. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Leonora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":663769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her buying & selling of ready-to-wear clothes and farming (sugarcane plantation) businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

M. is a married woman who lives in 112 Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes business, and a farming (sugarcane) business. Her husband, Agapito, who is 56 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's businesses. They have 12 children aged between 5 and 30. \r\n<br>Liberty joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liberty has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and fertilizer for her sugarcane. Liberty wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children and to improve her business. Liberty M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

Her husband works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They live in 109, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. Mary Jane earns her living by buying and selling charcoal and rice.  Mary Jane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Jane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  9,000  PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,200 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  For her fifth loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks of charcoal, rice, and rice bran for the pigs so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Mary Jane is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives at 111, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and buying & selling charcoal businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,300. Virginia is now borrowing PHP 21,000 so that she could continue to purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nVirginia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Fe  D. is 58 years old, married, and supports her family by operating two business ventures:  General store and Eatery (\"carinderia\") businesses. She lives in Rizal Extension, Brgy. 7, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and eatery (\"carinderia\") businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Ma. Fe is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nMa. Fe aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to pay as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children.

T. is from the village of Bagong Silang, Iligan City. She is 40 years old,  married, and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Renelda owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling wood or lumber in a variety of sizes in the local community. Renelda has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Renelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Renelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Renelda is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional lumbers to sell. This loan will be Renelda's third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this business for the last seven years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is impassable roads during the rainy seasons, thus slowing her business.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Gulchehra is 43 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of 3 children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle, and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. Gulchehra asks for a loan of $1976 USD in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, Rachana plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

The loan consultant who has been working with Ana describes her as a responsible, hard-working entrepreneur with a fighting spirit. One year ago, Ana was diagnosed with cancer of the uterus. Since then, she has undergone 2 operations, and at the moment she is going through ovarian treatment. One of her daughters is deaf\/mute; Ana and her husband have worked hard as a team in order to support all of their children.\r\n\r\nAna runs a sewing business out of her home. At the moment, she executes her sewing on 2 sewing machines, one that was a gift from her mother and the other Ana bought with her own funds. The main obstacle which Ana faces is a lack of access to funding for working capital. She is applying for this loan to make investments in prime sewing materials such as threads, fabrics and needles in order to produce various types of clothing, hopefully in time for the Christmas season. Ana makes all types of products including quilts, sports pants, pajamas and pillows.\r\n\r\nAna has been able to battle her illness and, with the support of her family, she has been able to carry on with her life after cancer. In the mornings, she takes care of domestic tasks, such as cooking and cleaning, and in the afternoons, she is dedicated to her business, sewing and making sales. Ana's long-term goals are to expand her business and earn more revenue to be able to make a more significant contribution to family

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand-tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

taller donde se fabrican puertas de metal con sus respectivos marcos, pintados y listos para instalar. Antes de iniciar este negocio tom\u00f3 toda su experiencia en un taller  de soldadura,  donde ejerc\u00eda la funci\u00f3n de latonero y soldador. Con esta iniciativa sus padres lo apoyaron y le prestaron un espacio de su propia casa para que \u00e9l  iniciara su propio negocio donde tuviera su empleo. As\u00ed inici\u00f3 Jes\u00fas su microempresa  y hace un a\u00f1o empez\u00f3 a construir su historia crediticia con financiamientos de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, ahora trabaja con un capital adicional y como el dice \u201cmas suave\u201d y con asesor\u00eda empresarial. Su sue\u00f1o es tener m\u00e1s empleados y conseguir mas adelante un local m\u00e1s grandes para atraer nuevos clientes y estar f\u00edsicamente m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo.  Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito y con este dinero comprar\u00e1 materias prima como alambre de soldadura, tornillos, tuercas, accesorios y l\u00e1minas met\u00e1licas; esta inversi\u00f3n asegura ser exitosa porque es para responder a pedidos de puertas y ventanas de buenos clientes, tiene una basta experiencia en dise\u00f1ar elaborar y entregar pedidos siempre y cuando disponga de todos los materiales necesarios, por otro lado Jes\u00fas  es una persona muy responsable y el mercado de estos productos est\u00e1 en un corredor comercial ubicado en el centro y dirigido a  almacenes especializados,  sin tener que vender al detalle;  tambi\u00e9n porque sus precios son muy competitivos y \u00e9l esta abriendo en el sur  de barranquilla un punto de venta que le permita a los clientes tener la facilidad de llegar  a comprarle, aunque  su taller  esta en un corredor vial importante muy cerca de una avenida principal en Barranquilla y ah\u00ed tien su propios clientes. As\u00ed los  indicadores financieros  del negocio de Jes\u00fas son los siguientes: Utilidad 50%, capital de trabajo $ 1.620.000 COP, endeudamiento 16%, rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar 30 d\u00edas. Jes\u00fas es un joven so\u00f1ador y muy seguramente tendr\u00e1 consolidado y posicionado su microempresa con sucursales de venta, tal como es su gran sue\u00f1o.","en":"Jes\u00fas C. is 25 years old and single.  His business is making metal doors.  He has a workshop where he makes his doors, together with frames, painted and ready to install.  Before setting up this business, he gained experience in a welding workshop, where he worked as a brazier and welder.\r\n\r\nJes\u00fas' parents supported him in his initiative and provided him with a space in their own home so that he could start his own business.  Jes\u00fas started his small business and a year ago he started to build a credit history with loans through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Now he works with additional capital which is, as he says, 'softer', and with business advice.  His dream is to have more employees and, in the future, to obtain larger premises so that he can attract new customers and be physically more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Jes\u00fas' second loan and he will use the money to buy raw materials such as solder wire, bolts, nuts, accessories and metal sheets.  This investment will be successful because he needs these materials to fill orders for doors and windows from good customers.  Jes\u00fas has quite a lot of experience in designing, making and delivering orders, whenever he has the material he needs.  Jes\u00fas is a responsible person. The market for these products is a commercial corridor located in the city center and aimed at specialized warehouses.  He does not have to sell retail.   Jes\u00fas' prices are very competitive and he is opening a sales point in the south of Barranquilla which allows his customers to buy from him easily.

With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Julio's farmland is located in the province of La Mar-Ayacucho, Peru. His lands are expansive and the care he provides has made them one of the best crops in the area. It's for this reason that when he goes to sell his coffee, cocoa and cocoa leaves in the city of San Francisco he obtains very good prices due to the quality of the products. What he enjoys most about his work is sowing his lands and making them fertile. He has been doing this activity of 32 years and considers the most difficult task to be keeping his crops safe from plagues. With time, he wants to purchase more lands in other areas so he can increase his products and add more variety of products. This is his 16th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he knows that he has to pay on time if he wants to be granted more loans in the future.

She is 40 years old, she studies until the 6th grade, she is married and has 3 kids that are her own and 1 adopted kid. Her children are named Jorge, Esli and Gabriel. Jorge is 11 years old,  Esli is 6 years old and Gabriel is 3 years old. Jorge and Esli are  both currently in elementary school. Antonia's adopted daughter, Azucena, is 17 years old, is married and has a son.\n\nSe\u00f1ora Antonia has a sewing workshop and requests the loan to invest in raw materials for the workshop.  She will buy yarn, needles, oil, closures, springs, parts, fringe, scissors, fabric, lace, ribbon.  She offers her customers aprons in 4 different styles which she makes and sells.  She sometimes makes uniforms for the elementary school and sports uniforms for basketball.  She also has silk screen and printing services.  She prepares napkins for quincea\u00f1eros (girls' 15th birthday parties), baptisms, and first communions.  She started her business 11 years ago, before which she used to work in a sewing workshop making decorative baby items, like diaper bags, crib veils, and linings for baby carriers, which were produced for Liverpool department store.  She inherited a small space of 50 square meters from her father, which is where she has her workshop.  She started with loans and the industrial machines and silk-screen printing were bought from the liquidation of the sewing workshop where she had worked.   Her business is located at her home in Tlayecac.  Se\u00f1ora Antonia participated in a statewide sewing contest where there were 31 participants from several places.  She won first prize, and with it bought 2 industrial machines. \n\nHer business is important and special as she is able to sustain herself financially.  It is a source of work for her family as her husband sells the aprons that Antonia manufactures, and her adopted daughter also works with her.  She is proud to make the aprons. She started with 8 plastic aprons that could be used for doing the washing without getting wet.  She made these with pieces of left-over plastic that the lady where she worked gave her.  Her husband went to sell them, and they wound up going very fast.  With what she made from the sale she bought more plastic and was able to grow her customers.  Her customers are varied, and she makes aprons in bulk for the tortilla makers, the butchers, the taco makers. \n\nA challenge facing the business is the climate, as dust enters because the workshop is not finished.   It lacks ironwork, a door, and glass in the windows. The business profits are reinvested, used for food, for repaying the loan and for household expenses. She is planning to expand her workshop.  She wants to buy a computerized embroidery machine and a machine for making buttonholes, and she thinks that with saving and the loan she will be  able to complete this.  The improvements she wants to make to her home are ironwork for her workshop, plastering and putting in glass on the second floor, and tiling the bathroom to expand the workshop.  She sometimes employs more people in the month of December, when she has more work.  She dreams of a having a full workshop and employing more people.  She is very excited about this loan that will be provided, because if she knows how to manage it things will go better for her and she can grow her workshop.  What she wants for the future of her children is that they consider a career or job, and if they like sewing, she will teach them her craft. \n\nShe likes Tlayecac because it was where she was born and raised and the people are very pleasant.

They began this business over 26 years ago and operates it all the way to the Andean plateaus where the maca root grows.  Felicia bought this product in order to resell them at local markets.  Beforehand, the idea of making maca root flour was suggested because the product would sell at a higher price.  The process of making maca root flour is to dry the product under the sun, turning the maca from time to time.  Afterwards, they are crushed by hand using an artisan grinder; the result of which is maca root flour.  She has a great desire to overcome obstacles, as such she is now thinking of using the same process to make carrot flour.

All of them work.\r\n\r\nMarta has a computer service business called Ciber Queta and she also has a sewing workshop.  She requested the loan to service the machines and to buy thread, needles, oil and scissors.  She also needs part of it for food for the household.  She sells candy and computer services to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe started the business 7 years ago and it\u2019s her son\u2019s but she tends to it.  With respect to the sewing: she first learned ironing and then sewing.  She used to make aprons to sell.  She has three industrial sewing machines in her workshop.  At first, she used a borrowed machine that she got from the \u201cmaquilero\u201d (person who assembles clothing for third parties).  Later on, as she did more and more clothing assembly jobs, she saved up and bought a sewing machine and then another two.  Her business is in her house.\r\n\r\nHer business is important to her because she earns income.  Her favorite part of the business is sewing and sewing gives her much satisfaction.  She remembers proudly when she got her first machine that allowed her to expand her business.  Her customers are different people because she goes out to sell her items.  Her business is popular and she\u2019s also well known thanks to the computers, or the Cyber, and zipper repairs.  She is planning to expand buying more fabric to have merchandise to work with.  She plans to accomplish this either with savings or with the loan.\r\n\r\nHer business faces competition from other people who do the same thing.  She uses profits from the business for food.  She is very happy with the loan she\u2019s getting because it will help her in business buying merchandise and providing working capital.  Her dreams and aspirations are to stay in business and to be able to share what the business produces with her children. Tlayecac is a very beautiful place.

She also wants to buy some chickens and turkeys to raise, and she needs the loan to do all of this.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for Do\u00f1a Teresa when the electricity and water bills come in, because sometimes they can be so expensive that she doesn't know how she will pay. On occasions her daughter helps her out, but not always, and when she can't Do\u00f1a Teresa has to use money from the store, which she then can't re-invest.

The same thing happens with the water. \r\n\r\nOne of Do\u00f1a Teresa's goals is to buy a young milk cow, and thus no longer have to buy milk. Milk is very expensive to buy and there is never enough for the three of them in the house. \r\n\r\nFor Do\u00f1a Teresa it is very important to save her earnings for her old age.

The group is composed of 12 people, all women. The woman who leads this group is Antonia Florencia L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez.  All of the women have different activities with which they support their families.\r\n\r\nWe will tell the story of one member of the group, named Rosa Elia Jim\u00e9nez C.. 31 years old, she is a single mother and has a 4-year-old son named Jared who is in kindergarten.  Rosa Elia dedicates herself to the sale of candy as a street vendor in different parts of the city, such as the central park, outside of public schools and at various intersections.  Rosa did not have formal schooling after having completed 4th grade, she comes from a humble family and lives in a small house made of laminated cardboard, wood, and concrete.  She has 4 sisters and her father is engaged in making and selling flavored ice, while her mother of 60 years also sells sweets.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult situations facing Rosa is the total loss of her inventory: she tells us a few days ago her house was robbed and they took all of her merchandise that she and her family worked so hard for, as well as some of their other investments, leaving them totally ruined.  She described her desperate situation with tears of sadness and frustration that she could not hide.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia joined a credit group out of the extreme necessity to restart her business from scratch after her life savings were stolen in a few minutes.  She will use the loan to purchase the products that she has traditionally sold: hard candy in different flavors, popsicles, caramels, candy made from cajeta syrup, chewing gum, cornmeal fritters, tamarind pulp and candies, mints, peanut brittle, roasted peanuts, popcorn, chile sauce for jicama, and jellies.\r\n\r\nRosa has great hope that she will bounce back very soon and that she will also be able to recuperate her family losses.  She wants to have a dignified house and not to have her business go through that again.  She dreams of seeing her son succeed one day and become a good person who works at a good job.  She would like to give him more schooling in the future and grow the business, or even create another one.  The most important thing for her family going forward is that they do not have gaps in income as today, and that her parents will be able to retire without having to work in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe members of the \u201c\u00c1lvaro Carrillo\u201d group are simple women, whose only desire is to improve their quality of life; they believe in their dreams, in the vision of a better world where there is not so much poverty and insecurity.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia, crying in happiness and sadness at the same time, smiles at us without hiding her pain.  Her smile is the best form gratitude we can provide, thank you to Fundacion Realidad and to those who support Kiva for being so generous.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the woman who make up the \u201c\u00c1lvaro Carrillo\u201d group and each of their businesses:\r\n\r\nFeliza Antonia Miguel \u2013 Cheese sales\r\nAntonia Florencia L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez \u2013 Perfume sales\r\nEpifania S.

The population of this area is comprised of Dominicans and Haitian immigrants. She operates a little underwear store.\r\n\r\nYanet is a single mom of one child and she lives with her parents. She tells us that her biggest challenge is to have her own house. Her favorite activity is tending to her business and work.\r\n\r\nYanet is very excited to receive her fourth loan through Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully repaid her previous loan. This was a step toward making her business grow. She has had her business for about two years. She started with a small amount of savings she had. She plans to invest this new loan into purchasing various types of underwear.

The group is located in Nuevo Buenavista community which is in the town of San Miguel Soyaltepec, in the State of Oaxaca.  The group has 7 members who all know each other because they are neighbors.  This is their fourth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is called Rutilo V. L..  He is 38 years old and studied up to the sixth year of elementary school.  He is married and has 5 children: 4 daughters and 1 son.  Rutilo has a taco restaurant in his home which is called 'El Rinrin' because that is the name of his youngest child.  He needs a loan to buy meat, oil, tortillas, tomatoes, chilis, dishes and disposable bags.  His neighbors tell us that his are the best tacos in the community.  Rutilo hopes that in the future he will have his own premises so that his business can grow and he can proviD. his customers with a better service.  He hopes to use his profits to proviD. his children with an education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMrs Fidencia L. S. is also a member of the San Jos\u00e9 group.  She didn't study.  She is married and has four children who are already married.  She raises pigs which she then sells.  She also has a small corn mill.  She carries out her businesses from her home.
