is a 50-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a vegetable farm. She lives in Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her vegetable farm, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000.

She lives in the municipality of Tuburan, Cebu. Liza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to purchase some goods for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Liza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

like her fellow community partners in CCT*, Paulina A., 58, is determined to get only the best in life. One disappointment she has was not going to college; now, she is firm in her decision not to have any more major regrets in life. \r\n\r\nPaulina is married to Carlos, a supervisor. They live as a family in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nPaulina runs her own sari-sari (variety) store in their community. She has done so for five years, and her neighbors already are familiar with how she conducts her business. Paulina wants to know what her customers want and aims to meet those preferences. She carefully chooses her products and sells them attractively, earning around 10,000 Philippines pesos (PhP) per month.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she needs more finances to keep her business growing, Pauline applied for a Php12,000 loan. She plans to use this to purchase essential goods, such as shampoo, soap, instant noodles, biscuits, and drinks, which her regular customers typically look for. The loan helps in leveraging the profitability of her store and allows her to pay their bills and buy what her family wants.\r\n\r\nTough competition within the vicinity, low sales at certain times of the year, and unpaid debts by some customers are just a few of the problems Paulina has. But she refuses to let these hurdles keep her from obtaining the best she could have. She holds on to her dream of acquiring their own lot, building their own house, having a bigger store with wholesale products, and buying their own car.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":721265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Just as she is taught in her entrepreneurial training as a community partner in CCT, Anna Victoria C., 36, chooses not to settle for anything less than what she can get. She is only a high school graduate but at present she has a business she can call her own. Anna is married to Bobby, a printing operator. They have four children of which three are already studying. The youngest is still not of school age. Their family resides in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nAnna\u2019s business centers on electronic load for mobile phones. She capitalizes on the huge demand for mobile communication and the means to be connected to others via call or text. She sells electronic load for Smart, Globe, and Sun network clients. Also, she buys and sells biscuits like choco chips in the neighborhood. With no assistants hired to help her, she is able to earn 11,000 Philippine pesos monthly.\r\n\r\nTo level up her business, she borrowed 11,000 PHP. This will greatly help her grow her business as she needs more money on hand to stock load for sale. With this loan, she can be assured that she will not run out of load to sell to customers who need it anytime of the day. Also, she plans to venture into the rice selling business, as rice is also a sought-after commodity elsewhere in the country. The loan also helps her save up and be able to buy things her children need.\r\n\r\nThe problem of lacking finances to stock electronic load for retailing pushed Anna to get a loan and set things right in her business. She also finds it hard to collect payments from neighbors with long lists of debts. Her health is also one major problem. Nevertheless, the encouragement she gains from the fellowship in CCT helps her not to lose hope. She dreams of having a bigger store and a bigger home which they can really call their own. To reach this goal, she looks for other possible sources of income. Just like any other parent, it is her desire to see her children finish their studies.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":721293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

right from her mouth, Sonia P., 53, admits to being a simple person who lives her life for others. Sonia is a community partner of CCT* in Pasay City. She has no family of her own; nevertheless, her siblings and friends consider themselves blessed because of her. Sonia reached college and is now dedicated to making her business reach new heights.\r\n\r\nSonia rents out the rooms in her house to boarders \u2013 students, working professionals and transients.  She has been in this business for 12 years now; so, she has quite a good grasp of managing rooms well and keeping a good, relaxing ambiance in the house. As well, her personality jives with the different individual clients she gets to meet. Monthly she is able to earn 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nBecause she is taking her business to new heights, Sonia decided to borrow 25,000 PHP. This is a great help to her business, as she needs the money to buy additional materials, such as metal, cement and other construction materials, to improve the room facilities. She really wants to make the rooms look better and to add more to accommodate more clients. Because the loan enables her to shape up her business, she is also able to give financially to siblings who do not have work.\r\n\r\nAt present, Sonia battles a health problem, as her stomach frequently hurts. Her head also aches with clients who do not pay their dues on time; sometimes, not at all! Still, these are not enough to stop Sonia from reaching new business heights. She desires to level up her rental services from rooms to a condominium. She plans on buying her own lot and building another house. She dreams of having her own car. Of course, she also has a dream for her siblings. Simple as she is, she wants to be of assistance to them and to others even in the years to come.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":721302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"Renovation

the death of a loved one, a person does not stop living. Mamerta S., age 61, still has something to live for even without her husband at her side any more. Maita, as she is called by fellow community partners in CCT*, reached high school level during her educational years; at present, she devotes her time to running her own small business. She has her seven children to continue living for. Maita\u2019s family resides in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nA sari-sari (variety) store serves as Maita\u2019s main source of income. With it, she strives to meet the immediate needs of her community as she makes every effort to earn income for her family. The store is residential and is thus accessible to the family. Maita has been running a sari-sari store for 25 years now; she did so even when her husband Valentin, also a vendor, was still living. Monthly, Maita earns Php 12,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Maita loans Php 10,000. She will make good use of the loan by purchasing products that are in demand in their location, such as the vinegar and coal used by some families to prepare their meals. Maita says the loan also enables her to give to family members when an emergency arises. \r\n\r\nThe challenge Maita has to face is the selling of products that are not much in demand, such as canned goods. People in her community are not much into buying these goods, as they prefer cooking their own meals. But one good thing is that Maita can focus on making her business efficient, as she currently has no significant personal problems. She desires to make her business more profitable in order to be able to help others. She hopes that her sari-sari store will grow into a grocery, so that she will be able to renovate her commercial space as well as their house.

Still, Asuncion manages to stay on her feet and make the best of what she has now. She finished college and is now running her own micro enterprise. Asuncion has two children who are both in college. They reside in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nA small sari-sari (variety) store is what Asuncion focuses on as the primary source of income for the family. She observes which products are mostly in demand, which brands are preferred, and which needs of the community have yet to be met. The store is located at their home and she runs it on her own. With this small business Asuncion is able to earn Php 12,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, she would like to request a Php 32,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more quantities of quality products to add to her stock in the sari-sari store. The loan will be very helpful in sustaining the store and it allows Asuncion to provide for the needs of her children, including providing their daily allowances.\r\n\r\nAsuncion has faced a lot of problems lately. She has no hired person to look after her store. That is why when she has an important task to do outside home, she is forced to close the store. She also carries the burden of providing for the needs of her family, now that her husband isn\u2019t around to depend on. Nevertheless, Asuncion stands strong, knowing that the best is yet to come for her family. She makes the best of running her business in order to be able to finance the studies of her children up until college. She desires eventually to acquire another space for her business.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT* community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a 51-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  Transportation, Welding Shop and Buy & Sell of Rice. She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.  Pilar is borrowing PHP 26,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Pilar aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a transportation (tricycle) business.  Her husband Rodolfo, Sr., who is 58 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 8 to 27 years old. Elna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to repair the sidecar of her tricycle so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Elna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.  Estelita is borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can purchase spare parts to repair her fishing boat. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Ma. Lida is borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 22nd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma. Lida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating a furniture-making business.  Her husband Amado, who is 48 years old, works as a furniture maker to earn his living. They have three children who are 18 to 21 years old. Mila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 35,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 45,000 to purchase furniture materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's educations. Mila is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating two businesses:  buy & sell of eel fish and pig fattening. Her husband Jennifer, who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 3 to 11 years old. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 32,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase more eel fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and her children's education.  Jocelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

is a 27-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fish vending business. She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Lorry is borrowing PHP 11,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Lorry aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Javzanpagma has a 4-year-old son who goes to kindergarten and a 14-year-old daughter in secondary school. \r\n\r\nJavzanpagma started her business in 2004 by selling building materials at Tsaiz, Mongolia's biggest raw materials outdoor market, with a working capital of 2,000,000 MNT. In 2007, she bought a semi-automatic cutting machine for 3,000,000 MNT to produce firewood. Javzanpagma buys raw materials from the wood truck which comes from the countryside and sells the firewood. As a result of her hard work, she now has working capital of 6,500,000 MNT.\r\n \r\n<p>Javzanpagma is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 MNT to buy more wood this season as the price will be lower compared to summer. Therefore she can buy wood at a low price and produce firewood to sell at a higher price in the summer.

Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 12 children who are between 11 and 41 years old. Purita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 27 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Purita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 28th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, to buy materials and equipment for tailoring and stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and to get a better job. Purita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a 63-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  buy and sell of peanuts and pig fattening.   She lives in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her buy and sell of peanuts and pig fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buy and sell of native materials and a banana & coconut business.  She has five children who are 11 to 31 years old.  Gloria  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gloria  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the needs of her family.  Gloria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 40-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  pig fattening, buy & sell and frozen foods businesses.  She lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,400.  Theresa is borrowing PHP 12,000 to fund her business operations.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Theresa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 58-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a sari sari (general) store.  She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her sari sari (general) store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  Eduvijes is borrowing PHP 24,000 to purchase more stock to sell in her sari-sari store. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 21,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Eduvijes aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.

is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Oslob, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband Quirico, who is 45 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 7 to 21 years old. Rosario joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosario has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 22,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosario L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 53-year-old widow who supports her family by operating three business ventures:  a general store, farming and buying and selling fruits. She lives in the municipality of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.  Shirly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Shirly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy stock for the store and additional capital for buying and selling fruit so that she can continue to save for the future higher education of her children.  Shirly is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Francisco, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 33 and 38 years old.  Bella Rosa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bella Rosa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy more goods to sell to customers so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Bella Rosa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This place is known for being a commercial zone, and for its traditional festivals of San Pedro and San Pablo, as well as for the happiness of its people.  \r\n\r\nHere we had the opportunity to speak with Alfonsina.  She is married and has her home well put together.  She had two children, but one of them passed away.  Her husband is a teacher at the Picoaza National school.  \r\n\r\nShe sells clothes and sheets door-to-door.  She says that she began her business with the first loan that she received from the bank.  She works 4 days a week and on the weekends she collects money for the orders that she left on credit.  In order to furnish goods for her business she has to travel to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito every 15 days.  Currently she mostly sells seasonal clothing, like bathing suits, shorts and caps.  She also sells miscellaneous goods and sunglasses, mostly for women. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be invested in sheets, sunglasses, miscellaneous goods and seasonal clothing.  She is a founding member of the village bank and is very grateful to the Espoir Foundation since she was able to start her business thanks to them.  Her dream is to have a shop with all of the services for her customers.

He lives with his daughters, ages 14 and 16, in the department of Jucuapa in Usulut\u00e1n.  The house they live in is rented, and it is there that he has the tailor\u2019s shop where he makes all types of clothing.  He learned this trade 18 years ago and, to this day, it has been his source of income.  He does not have a fixed schedule in which to do his work.\r\n\r\nHe currently requests a loan to purchase fabric in different colors and styles, threads, zippers, buttons and clasps.  Upon buying these supplies, Oscar will be able to work more securely since, by having what he needs to make clothes, he will also be able to do his work in less time and higher quality.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that, after his investment, his workshop will be busy.  With new materials to fill orders, he also wants to increase his income so that his family can count on a higher standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":721970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

Jenelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and family. Jenelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  buying & selling dried fish, operating a sari-sari store and a farming business. Her husband Ernesto, who is 67 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 21 and 37 years old. Rosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Ilog, Negros Occidental.

They have three children who are between 15 and 20 years old. Vilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase a stock of raw materials so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and family needs. Vilma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a 54-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  buying & selling root crops (sweet potato) and buying & selling peanuts and charcoal. She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. Wennie is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Wennie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

vina is a 28-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and a farming business. She lives in Quezon, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,400. Divina is borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Divina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To make a living, she owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling detergent and bar soaps. She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately $70 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Virginia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Felisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Dalaguete, Cebu.

They have four children who are between 3 and 12 years old. Chenee joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chenee has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 22,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to use as additional capital for her fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Chenee is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Rizal, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two businesses:  food vending and rice retailing. Her husband Rey, who is 54 years old, works as an Ice Plant Operator to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 10 and 31 years old. Vilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 to fund the operation of her food vending business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Vilma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 45-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  a sari-sari (general) store and farming.  She lives in the municipality of Quezon, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Heidy is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Heidy aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Evante, who is 33 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 4 and 9 years old. Marivic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marivic has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to buy more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future higher education of her children. Marivic is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Edgar D.\".\r\n\r\nEdgar is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Edgar owns & operates a general store.

Edgar has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Edgar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edgar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Edgar is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 11th loan taken out by Edgar from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to his house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

is a 47-year-old widow who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes\/pants and fish vending.  She lives in the municipality of Medellin, Cebu. Anselma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anselma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy fish & stocks of clothes\/pants to sell so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Anselma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a grocery store, a livestock business and buying and selling gasoline. Her husband Roel, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 10 and 16 years old. Antonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for future improvement in her business. Antonieta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He has a small store where he sells fabrics used for sewing national dresses. The business is located in a famous central market of Gafurov. Abdukarim has been in this business for 10 years already. He runs it with his mother, who encouraged him to start this business and is very supportive even now. \r\n\r\nAbdukarim is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase more goods. This business has its high season very soon. Abdukarim believes that opening second retail outlet will give him an advantage over his competitors and provide his family with more profit in the coming spring season.         \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has one child, aged 30.  In 2000, she established  her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy grocery goods for her shop.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Chini Shova plans to expand the business.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called  \"pasal\", are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical \"pasal\" might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

 A. is a 63 year old pensioner who lives in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is widowed and has eleven grown children; ten of them live on their own and the youngest son lives with her and helps in the household. In 1970, in order to support her family and cover all expenses, Almabubu decided to start her own business in cattle breeding. With a starting capital of 8,000 KGS, she managed to expand her farm. To reduce expenses for the livestock's foraging, she pastured her livestock in mountainous areas with native grasses. With the revenues, she was able to give good dowries to her daughters and provide them with all they needed.\r\n\r\nAlmabubu's farm now amounts to one cow and five sheep.

This is a mixed association of nineteen people who live in the same district and who have diverse businesses. The different products marketed generally by the women are fabrics, shoes, grains, and a variety of consumer items. The women have been active in commerce for over twenty years. \n\nMs. Ndeye, who presents the women, is the president of the women's group of the association APEC -AL-OUMA. She is requesting a loan of 2,250,000 francs for buying supplies with the goal of bolstering and expanding the group's businesses. The group's goal is to grow their profits in hopes of improving the well-being and the living standards of their respective families.\n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":722456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increasing
