Joining TYM, she made the first loan of 1,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in retailing, whose revenue was about 500,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. For 5 years of hard-working and constant studying, she and her husband have become experienced and used the loan more effectively. At the moment, they are buying poultries from local farms and selling them to restaurants, or local customers. This business brings in 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Besides, they also raise pigs and chickens at home, so the family\u2019s income is increasing securely.

Before joining the TYM Fund, her family mainly focused on farming and raising livestock for a living. After joining the Fund, she decided to open a clothes shop in the market. She used the first loan of 2,000,000VND (about 133USD) to invest in this shop, which helped to increase her family's monthly income by 400,000VND (about 26USD). After a period of using the loans effectively, her family has become one of the better-off families in the village. Her husband works as a construction worker with the monthly income of 1,500,000VND (about 100USD). This time, she would like to borrow 450USD to invest in her clothes shop.

Before joining the TYM Fund, her family's income came mainly from farming, livestock and her husband's income as a hired worker. After joining the Fund, she had more capital to invest in buying and selling poultry. Her first loan of 1,000,000VND (about 66USD) was used to purchase poultry from various poultry farms and resell them in wet market and kiosks. This business has brought about a substantial source of income for her family. Currently, her husband and children also help her in this business. Everyday, her husband and children buy poultry and resell them to various restaurants, while she sells them in the market.

Thi Gai has been a member of the TYM Fund for 8 years. Before joining the Fund, her family relied mainly on farming and raising livestock just like many other families in the rural areas. After obtaining the first loan, Mrs. Gai invested in raising quails to sell their eggs. This helped to improve her family's income. Not only did she use the subsequent loans to continue raising quails, but she also discussed with her family to purchase machinery to make tofu. This is a suitable food for the income and demand of the rural people so the production and sale of tofu has brought about a stable source of income for her family. Currently, her husband raises 500 quails, while Mrs. Gai and her children make tofu to sell in the market.

Karina is a prisoner at the Santa Teresa Preventative Center for Rehabilitation in Guatemala City.  She says that she has committed errors in her life but is now working to change and improve her life and her future.  The Guatemalan government provides food and the most basic necessities for prisoners, but the food amount is small and of very bad quality.  Therefore, prisoners usually need a little of their own money to supplement what they receive from the prison.  As a result, many prisoners in the Santa Teresa women\u2019s prison have businesses within the jail, as is common in much of the developing world.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina is very entrepreneurial and already has two businesses.  She works making arts and crafts to sell within the prison and is trying to set up a way to sell them outside as well.  Additionally she sells juices within the jail.  In the past she had access to another prisoner\u2019s freezer to cool the juice, but that prisoner left and took the freezer with her.  Obviously Karina can sell much more juice if it is cold, so she is requesting this loan to purchase a refrigerator.  She has already researched her options for refrigerators and has found a high quality used refrigerator and has also already gotten permission from the prison administration to bring it into the jail.  The refrigerator will cost 3,000 Guatemala Quetzals (approximately USD $400) and she will use the rest of her loan to buy more juice to sell.  She tries to maintain a stock of high quality juice and a good variety, such as pineapple, peach, and pear juice in addition to orange juice, apple juice, and Gatorade.  Karina also works to find the best prices for the juices and can currently buy many of the juices for 1.90 Quetzals each and sell them for 4 Quetzals each, a good return.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina has many dreams of how to improve her life and what she can do when she is able to leave jail.  She has already studied to be a secretary, but she wants to continue studying to specialize in computers and would also like to study English.  She wants to start a business selling clothes and has already though a lot about various strategies that she could implement to develop and improve this business.  She would also like to have a kiosk to sell the arts and crafts that she already makes.  \r\n<p>\r\nFAPE has just gotten permission from the Guatemalan government to loan money to prisoners in Santa Teresa and is also working with the government to provide training for starting a business.  They also are hoping to offer more training to improve businesses in the future.  Although these clients are not typical microfinance clients, like all FAPE clients, they can only receive loans if they have a business or have the desire to start a business and a good plan to do it.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina is extremely appreciative to have the opportunity to receive a loan to invest in her business.  When she leaves prison, she is going to face many challenges trying to reestablish her life.  She says that she is trying to start to save and plan now to be able to be successful when she is able to leave.  FAPE\u2019s training and her business that she is going to expand with the help of this loan are going to help her a lot to have more knowledge, experience, and maybe even a little money to help her get her new life started.  Furthermore, she will be able to take the refrigerator with her when she leaves jail.  Karina is very committed to reintegrating into society and never returning to prison.  Additionally, she says that she is very grateful to FAPE and to Kiva for giving her opportunities to rise above her mistakes and that these opportunities are like a light and a great blessing.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo learn a little more about Santa Teresa and FAPE\u2019s program there, you can go to this blog to read some observations from a Kiva Fellow: \r\n<A HREF=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2008\/08\/11\/a-day-in-prison\/ \">A Day in Prison<\/A>\r\n<p><b>\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nKarina no es una clienta Kiva t\u00edpica, pero como casi todos los clientes Kiva tiene varios desaf\u00edos y est\u00e1 luchando de desarrollar un negocio y mejorar su vida.  Karina es una presa en el Centro Preventivo de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Santa Teresa en la ciudad capital de Guatemala.  Ella dice que ha cometido errores en su vida, pero ahora est\u00e1 trabajando para cambiar y mejorar su vida y su futura.  El gobierno Guatemalteco provee comida y la necesidades m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos para los presos, pero la comida es poco y de muy mala calidad.  Entonces, las presas suelen necesitar un poco de su propio dinero para complementar lo que reciben de la c\u00e1rcel.  Por lo tanto, muchas de las presas en la c\u00e1rcel de mujeres en Santa Teresa tienen negocios dentro de la c\u00e1rcel, como es com\u00fan en mucho del mundo en desarrollo.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina es muy emprendedora y ya tiene dos negocios.  Trabaja en hacer manualidades que vende dentro de la c\u00e1rcel y esta tratando de arreglar una manera de venderlas afuera tambi\u00e9n.  Adem\u00e1s, tiene una venta de jugos dentro de la c\u00e1rcel.  En el pasado, ten\u00eda acceso a un congelador de otra presa para enfriarlos, pero ella se fue y llev\u00f3 su congelador con ella.  Obviamente Karina puede vender mucho m\u00e1s jugo si est\u00e1 frio, entonces est\u00e1 pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un refrigerador.  Ella ya ha investigado sus opciones para refrigeradores y ha encontrado un refrigerador usado pero de buena calidad y ya ha conseguido el permiso de la administraci\u00f3n de la c\u00e1rcel para traerlo en la c\u00e1rcel.  El refrigerador costar\u00e1 3.000 Quetzales Guatemaltecos (aproximadamente USD $400) y utilizar\u00e1 el resto de su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s jugos para vender.  Ella trata de mantener una reserva de jugos de buena calidad y variedad, como de pi\u00f1a, melocot\u00f3n, y pera, adem\u00e1s de jugos de naranja, manzana y Gatorades.  Karina tambi\u00e9n trabaja para encontrar los mejores precios para los jugos, y ahora puede comprar muchos de los jugos por 1.90 Quetzales y los puede vender por 4 Quetzales, un rendimiento bueno.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina tiene muchos sue\u00f1os de c\u00f3mo puede mejorar su vida y que puede hace cuando puede salir de la c\u00e1rcel.  Ella ya es secretaria, pero quiere estudiar la computaci\u00f3n para especializar y tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda estudiar el ingl\u00e9s.  Quiere iniciar un negocio de venta de ropa y ya ha pensado mucho en varias estrategias que se puede implementar para desarrollar y mejorar este negocio. Tambi\u00e9n quiere tener un quiosco para vender las manualidades como las que ya produce.  \r\n<p>\r\nFAPE acaba de conseguir el permiso del gobierno Guatemalteco para poder prestar dinero a las presas de Santa Teresa y tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 trabajando con el gobierno para ofrecer capacitaciones de c\u00f3mo iniciar un negocio, y tiene ganas de ofrecer m\u00e1s capacitaciones de c\u00f3mo mejorar un negocio en el futuro.  Aunque estos clientes no son clientes de microfinanzas t\u00edpicos, a la misma vez solamente se puede recibir pr\u00e9stamos si tiene un negocio o tiene ganas de empezar un negocio y un buen plan para hacerlo.  \r\n<p>\r\nKarina est\u00e1 extremadamente agradecida de tener la oportunidad de recibir cr\u00e9dito para invertir en su negocio.  Cuando sale de la c\u00e1rcel, va a tener muchas desaf\u00edos en tratando de restablecer su vida.  Dice que est\u00e1 tratando de empezar a ahorrar y planear ahora para poder tener \u00e9xito cuando puede salir.  Las capacitaciones de FAPE y su negocio que va a aumentar con la ayuda de este pr\u00e9stamo van a ayudarle much\u00edsimo en tener m\u00e1s conocimiento, experiencia, y quiz\u00e1s un poco de dinero para ayudarle en empezando su vida nueva.  Adem\u00e1s, podr\u00e1 sido llevar el refrigerador con ella cuando sale de la c\u00e1rcel.  Karina dice que es muy cometida de reintegrar en la sociedad y nunca regresar a la c\u00e1rcel.  Adem\u00e1s, dice que le agradece a FAPE y a Kiva por darle oportunidades de superarse de sus errores y sirven como una luz y una gran bendici\u00f3n.  \r\n<p>\r\nPara aprender up poco m\u00e1s de Santa Teresa y el programa de FAPE all\u00e1, se puede ir a este blog para leer algunas observaciones de una Kiva Fellow: <A HREF=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2008\/08\/11\/a-day-in-prison\/ \">Un D\u00eda en la C\u00e1rcel<\/A>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":190364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a refrigerator and juice to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-08-13T11:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-27T14:25:01Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2008-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":388.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":388.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":390.53,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":391.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339810,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":105.33,"local_amount":776.14,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":777.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313252,"comment":null},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":388.89,"processed_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930901,"comment":null},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":388.89,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855527,"comment":null},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":388.89,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395018,"comment":null},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":388.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086819,"comment":null},{"amount":52.77,"local_amount":388.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980387,"comment":null},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":388.88,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":389.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441194,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-13T14:25:01Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:41:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60261,"name":"Mb\u00e8ne","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mb\u00e8ne S. is a married woman raising 4 children.

Even so, she likes growing coffee because it reminds of her of pleasant moments and most of all she likes her daily contact with nature.  Some of the difficulties of the work come during the harvest and she has to have people to help her package her product and transport it to the city of Nazca where her children help her sell it.

Besides teaching, he has a small animal husbandry business. Through it he attempts to cover his family expenditures. His monthly salary is just 3,000 Afghanis ($60), and it's too difficult to feed his family with this amount. His wife also helps him in his work. She brings grass for the cows and makes yogurt from their milk. Y. sells the yogurt in the bazaar.\r\n<p>\r\nMuhammad Y. has 300 Afghanis ($6) daily income, but it's not enough for him. There are 11 members in his family, and the costs are going to be increasing day by day. Besides these problems, his father has a serious illness and Y. must treat him because he doesn't have other brothers to take this responsibility. These hard problems definitely made a big headache for him, and he didn\u2019t know how to find solution for it. After thinking deeply, he decided to buy more livestock and increase his income through them. He hopes that this decision may give a positive result. He has applied for a loan of 50,000 Afghanis from AFSG for 24 months.\r\n<p>\r\nY. hopes to eradicate the barriers of the problems as soon as possible and then treat his sick father.

I. has been taking out loans with MicroInvest for almost five years. She is married and has two children. Mohira graduated from the university with a teacher's degree in mathematics, but was not able to find a job in her field, got married, had children, and got stuck in family life. Her husband would not let her go to work - instead, she had to help her mother-in-law run the household. After the civil war her husband was left without a job, and they had to borrow from everybody. Their children were growing - they had to feed them, clothe them, educate them. Some of Mohira's girlfriends sold goods at the market. She also went with them several times. Eventually she earned their trust and they gave her some goods for sale. She started selling women's clothes in a women's clothing store.

As a young mother she had problems working and taking care of her baby at the same time, but thanks to her general store she can do both. Her only limitation is the high cost of the products and therefore she has little merchandise at her store and consequently few clients. Even though she became a mother at a very young age, her objectives are clear and the most important one is the well-being of her family which is her best motivation.

The furniture business he started a year ago started to go, and has received many orders. Many efforts has been taken, like asking friends to work together, however it did not solve his challenges. The expensive wood raw materials and limited machineries\/production tools are the main challenge in this business.\r\nNowadays Uma Wardana .employs 3 carpenters on a daily pay system. On average they are paid Rp35,000\/day.  (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp9,000-9,500.00). Every day those 3 carpenters could produce about Rp250,000. Not included electricity expense and equipment wear and tear.\r\nHis products results are quite good, clean and guaranteed quality, since all carpenters work in their expertise, so that his customers increase.\r\nDinari gave Rp10,000,000 additional loan for Uma Wardana, that was used to buy furniture making machinery and other raw materials. With this additional capital, Uma Wardana hopes that his business could increase, and fulfill all orders, so that his income would also increase.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSetiap Orang memiliki cita-cita untuk mengembangkan usaha yang di tekuninya. Begitu juga halnya dengan Uma Wardana .Usaha meubel yang telah dirintisnya sejak setahun belakangan ini kini mulai berjalan dan menerima banyak pesanan  Namun karena keterbatasan  modal membuat Uma Wardana belum bisa menerima semua pesanan yang masuk. Berbagai upaya telah diusahakan  termasuk di antaranya meminta teman untuk bekerjasama, namun belum juga bisa menyelesaikan kesulitan yang dihadapi. Mahalnya bahan baku kayu dan terbatasnya mesin \u2013mesin \/ alat produksi yang ada, masih menjadi kendala utama dalam usaha ini. \r\n\tSaat ini Uma wardana telah mempekerjakan 3 orang tukang dengan sistem gaji harian . Rata \u2013rata mereka digaji Rp. 35.000.- \/ hari. Dan dalam sehari ke tiga tukang ini bisa berproduksi rata-rata Rp. 250.000.- Belum termasuk biaya listrik dan penyusutan alat-alat    \r\nBarang- barang yang di produksinya hasilnya  cukup baik, rapi dan kwalitasnya terjamin karena hampir semua tukang yang ada bekerja sesuai bidangnya.sehingga pelanggannya makin hari makin bertambah . \r\nDinari memberi tambahan modal Rp 10.000.000 untuk mengembangkan usaha Umawardana yang olehnya di pergunakan untuk membeli mesin skap \/ serut dan bahan baku lainnya. Dengan tambahan modal ini Uma Wardana berharap usahanya akan lebih maju dan bisa memenuhi semua order, sehingga hasil yang di perolehpun akan meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":190948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Her husband's occupation is working for a private company. To fill in time after finishing housework,  Ni Luh  Suci  is raising 3 piglets for fattening, that she just bought after receiving a losn from DINARI. The price for those 3 pigs were Rp 900,000  (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp8,000-9,500.00), and the rest to build a stall and buying feed. Ni Luh Suci  bought mixed feed of wheat shells, concentrate and rice shells. After 6 months old, the 3 pigs will be sold at Rp 3,600,000, at a 6 months expense of Rp 2,600,000 due to high feed cost. Thus 6 months profit would be Rp 1,000,000. Ni Luh Suci is very much helped by this Dianri loan so that it would help in increasing her capital.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Luh Suci Muliani dan suaminya, I Ketut Suliana, sudah menikah hampir 17 tahun dan memiliki 3 orang anak.

Pekerjaan suaminya sebagai pegawai swasta. Untuk mengisi waktu setelah selesai mengerjakan pekerjaan rumah tangganya Ni Luh  Suci  memelihara 3 ekor babi penggemukan yang baru dibelinya setelah mendapat pinjaman dari DINARI. Harga 3 ekor babinya Rp. 900.000,- dan sisanya untuk membuat kandang dan membeli pakan.  Ni Luh Suci memberi campuran pakan dedak gandum, konsentrat dan dedak padi. Setelah berumur 6 bulan, 3 ekor babinya dijual dengan  harga Rp. 3.600.000,- dengan pengeluaran selama 6 bulan   Rp 2.600.000,- karena kebutuhan pakan saat ini mahal. Jadi keuntungan bersih yang didapat Rp.1.000.000,- selama 6 bulan.

She feeds the pigs twice a day (in the morning and evening) with a mix of rice padi chaff, wheat chaff and concentrates. She is planning to spend $161.51 for food during the next 5 months, and sell the pigs for $279.96. Thus, her net profit for 5 months will be $53.84. Her first loan will be used to build pig pen.

Modal yang dikeluarkan untuk membeli bibit babi sebesar Rp. 600.000,-. Untuk membuat kandang menghabiskan Rp. 2.000.000,- dan sisanya untuk biaya pakan selama 5 bulan. Setiap hari setelah selesai mengerjakan pekerjaan rumah, Ni Ketut Tari segera mengurus babinya. Pertama yang dilakukannya adalah membersihkan kandang, setelah itu memandikan dan terakhir memberi makan. Setiap hari Ni Ketut Tari memberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore hari. Adapun campuran pakannya : dedak padi, dedak gandum, dan konsentrat. Sampai panen menghabiskan pakan Rp.1.500.000,- Sedangkan penghasilan kotornya Rp. 2.600.000,- Jadi keuntungan bersih yang diterima Ni Ketut Tari selama 5 bulan Rp.500.000,- Pinjaman pertama ini difokuskan untuk membuat kandang dan kelengkapannya, setelah melunasi pinjaman ini, ia berencana untuk membeli induk

Lewat organisasi  yang ada didesanya yang bekerja sama dengan DINARI akhirnya Ni Putu Sulasmi mendapat tambahan modal Rp.5.000.000,- .Ni Putu Sulasmi mempunyai 4 orang tukang ukir yang dibayar borongan. Saat ini Ni Putu Sulasmi memiliki pesanan ukiran 1 pintu dan 2 jendela. Harga 1 pintu dan 2 jendela mencapai Rp. 7.000.000,-. Proses pembuatan memerlukan waktu 1 bulan untuk mengerjakannya. Adapun modal yang dikeluarkan selama 1 bulan mulai dari bahan sampai ongkos tukang mencapai Rp. 5.500.000,-. Sedangkan pendapatan 1 bulan Rp.7.000.000,- jadi keuntungan bersihnya Rp. 1.500.000,-. Ni Putu Sulasmi dan suaminya sangat bersyukur mendapat pinjaman dari DINARI. Dan harapannya supaya DINARI bisa mempromosikan ukiran kayu yang dimilikinya. Supaya lewat usaha ini bisa untuk mencukupi semua kebutuhannya, termasuk membiayai 2 anaknya yang masih

With renewed spirit everyday, Indriani left her home by 5:00 am to the market to buy her inventory. With an initial capital of $107, Indriani completes her convenient kiosk with snacks, drinks and everyday household supplies. Indriani's kiosk is open from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. The profit that she earns is used to help her husband, Nengah Yudiartama, who has his own business. Indriani also uses her profits to meet her financial needs and pay for her children's elementary school and kindergarten tuitions. Her house is built on a land that they purchased with quite solid structure.

Dengan semangat baru setiap harinya,  pukul 05.00 pagi, Indriani sudah pergi kepasar untuk membeli bahan dagangannya. Dengan modal awal Rp.1.000.000, Indriani melengkapi isi warungnya dengan bermacam-macam barang dagangan seperti makanan ringan,  minuman ringan dan kebutuhan keluarga sehari \u2013 hari.. Indriani membuka warungnya pada pagi hari pukul 06.00 pagi dan tutup pada pukul 06.00 sore. Keuntungan yang didapatnya dipakai untuk membantu suaminya, Nengah Yudiartama, yang bekerja sebagai wiraswasta.

She also sells dried fish at her home.\r\n<p>\r\nMaking malwa takes times and begins by mixing millet flour with water and putting it underground for several days to ferment.

Tabitha is a thirty-six-year-old married woman with three children between the ages of five and fourteen. She lives in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania, where she opened a clothing store called Tabby Designs in 2006. She runs the store with one employee and the assistance of her children, all of whom are also enrolled in school. Tabitha sells traditional African cloth (called boutque), unique handcrafted accessories, and handicrafts to locals and tourists. The outfit you see Tabitha wearing in this picture is one she has made herself from boutque cloth! She has been making a monthly profit of approximately 500 USD from her store that she uses to supplement her husband's income and contribute to the family. Tabitha is requesting a first-time loan of 450 USD to purchase cloth and dyes to customize the traditional clothing that she sells. Tabitha is an exceptionally hard worker who spends eleven hours per day at her store for six days a week. In the future, with increased profits earned as a result of anticipated increased sales of her unique goods, Tabitha hopes to improve the quantity and range of products offered at her store.  \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase raw materials for her clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T19:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T05:02:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345764,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347905,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970479,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886696,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435958,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130262,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T05:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60579,"name":"Kheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"KH.

Rehema is the owner of a Mama Lishe (or local caf\u00e9) in the Kinondoni area of Dar es Salaam where she prepares and serves delicious Tanzanian cuisine to her customers. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business is a restaurant or caf\u00e9, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Rehema is currently able to make monthly profits of 200 USD from her Mama Lishe that she uses to support her family. As a thirty-two-year-old single mother of three children under the age of twelve, her business is indispensable to her family's well being. Rehema is requesting is requesting a loan of 300 USD to allow her to purchase supplies such as larger cooking utensils and chairs, which will allow her to expand her business to serve more customers. She is hopeful that this will help increase her profits from her business. \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase supplies for her cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T19:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T03:39:38Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":53268,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344456,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":91.5,"local_amount":99818.18,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":105957,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347906,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970480,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886697,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435959,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T03:39:38Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60584,"name":"Halima S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima Ramadhan is a Tanzanian business woman.

Mariam is a fifty-six-year-old enterprising entrepreneur who successfully runs two small businesses, a Mama Lishe (or local caf\u00e9) and a beauty salon in Dar es Salaam by working for thirteen hours a day every day of the week. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business is a restaurant or caf\u00e9, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Mariam operates her businesses with the assistance of two employees and her children. She is requesting a 275 USD loan to expand her caf\u00e9. Specifically, she intends to use the loan to purchase soft drinks and juice for her clients, and to buy tables and chairs to allow her to serve more customers. Mariam is a widow who supports her six children, two of whom are under the age of eighteen, so increased profits from the caf\u00e9 will be used towards family expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more supplies for her cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T19:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T16:56:19Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":50181.82,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":53268,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344457,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45.67,"local_amount":49818.18,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52882,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347907,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970481,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886698,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435960,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":53075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130263,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T16:56:19Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60586,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Ms. Aminata Traor\u00e9,  age 40, lives with her five children and her husband in a monogamous family in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the city of Bougouni (third economic region of the Republic of Mali).

is a thirty-three-year-old mother and small business owner from Dar es Salaam. She is the owner of a \"Mama Lishe\" or local caf\u00e9 that serves up delicious meals at affordable prices. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Despite only being in business since 2007, Arafa's enterprise has grown to require the help of an additional employee and generate monthly profits of 250 USD. She uses the money earned from her caf\u00e9 to support her twelve-year-old son who is enrolled in school. Additionally, she is also the provider for a local orphan. \r\n<p>\r\nArafa is requesting a loan of $275, which she intends to use to purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, and wheat flour. With the increased profits that she hopes this will generate, Arafa plans to improve the standard of living of her family. In the future, she aspires to expand her caf\u00e9 to new locations as well as increase the scale of her operation.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional cooking supplies for her cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T21:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arafa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-31T22:51:35Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344458,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":110,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":127380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347909,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970483,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886700,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-17T22:51:35Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60594,"name":"Elizabeti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy additional chicks and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T21:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T01:51:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344460,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":59454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":63111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347912,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970486,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886703,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435964,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130267,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027098,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613138,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010221,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T01:51:05Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60601,"name":"Keng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Keng K., 45, is the mother of six children and lives in Kampong Chhnang province, Cambodia.

is a thirty-three-year-old married woman with four children, three of whom are in school. She also supports an additional dependent who is an orphan. She owns a local Mama Lishe in Dar es Salaam, or small caf\u00e9, that she runs with two employees to return a monthly profit of about 500 USD. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Ester is requesting a loan of 275 USD to purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, maize and wheat flour. In the future, she would like to open another Mama Lishe to serve her delicious food to even more customers!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

Josephine is a forty-year-old widow with two children under the age of eighteen, and she also takes care of an orphan who is a relative. She runs a local Mama Lishe, or small caf\u00e9, with three employees to generate a monthly profit of 700 USD. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Josephine also works as a caterer for local businesses on an as-needed basis, which has helped her increase her monthly profit immensely. She is requesting 450 USD to purchase additional serving equipment to help fulfill her catering orders and extra cooking supplies such as rice and potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n<p>Jesca established her poultry business in 2006 and she manages it with an employee. Her business model involves hatching and raising chicks and then selling them wholesale as chickens to the villagers at a premium. Her business makes about $US500 in profit per month. She is requesting a loan for $US450 to purchase additional chicks and feed.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase additional chicks and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T12:42:42Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347916,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970490,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886707,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435967,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130269,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027100,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613140,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010223,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T12:42:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":60621,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Born on March 31, 1973 in Porto-Novo in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 Department of southeastern Benin, Ms. Marie O. is married with three children, of which two, Arnaud and Brigitte, are in the 8th grade and 6th grade, respectively, and still under her care.
