The people who live there are extremely hardworking and the area is known for its exquisite cuisine.\r\n<p>\r\nSr. Juan Carlos is a seafood merchant at Market Number One in the city of Portoviejo.  The loan he received will be invested into his business.  He always travels to the fishing port of Tarqui in Manta to buy containers full of fish.  Juan Carlos works with another member and the two of them divide the work.  He says his business is doing very well and that he has been in this line of work for ten years.  Juan Carlos is 27 years old and married.  His wife devotes her time to taking care of the household chores and looking after their children.\r\n<p>\r\nJuan Carlos is very responsible with his family.  He does not consider having to leave for work at 4am each morning to be a sacrifice.  Saturdays and Sundays are when he sells the most because he takes advantage of the fair.  With this new loan, Juan Carlos plans to continue growing his business.  He will invest all of the money in the purchase of fish, shrimp, and squid.  Juan Carlos says he was able to start this business thanks to his mother.  She had a diner at the market where he worked as a little boy.  As he grew up, he was exposed to the world of sales and now serves many people so that he can get ahead.  He currently has his own home, so he feels very content with what he has achieved so far.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Digna is also part of the Virgin of Guadalupe Communal Bank that meets in Portoviejo.  She is 50 years old, married, and has five children.  She sells prepared foods and has a restaurant in the city of Portoviejo.  Digna wakes up at 3am to go shopping at the central market in the city.  As a little girl, she learned how to do this job from her parents.  She started her business a year ago and works alone, although she occasionally has the help of her 15 year old daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nApart from the restaurant, Sra. Digna also sells fish by the pound on Sundays.  She buys her products and then resells them.  With this new loan, she plans to invest in her business by purchasing rice by the quintal (46kg), legumes, meats, and everything else necessary to prepare her dishes.

Because of this they feel very grateful for the opportunity offered by the Committee of Rural Women program which provides them with the chance for people to know about the work they do day after day to help their families get ahead. In the area where these women live, there is little economic activity so they need to travel to the center of the city to offer their products such as milk, yuca, fresh vegetables, cheese, corn, peanuts, tortillas, oil and lard, and other products that they produce for sale.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Ms.Teresa A. who works selling milk. She has several milk cows and to care for them she must work several hours each day taking care of the cows since her husband works the entire day as a farmer. She sometimes does the work with the help of her children who also study.\r\n\r\nEvery day she gets up very early to milk the cows since by early morning she must have everything ready for sale from her house or to take to the city.\r\n\r\nShe requests the loan for the purchase of wood since she wants to construct milking stalls that will greatly facilitate her daily work.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

M. is a married woman who lives in Banaba, Kalumbuyan, Bawayan City, Negros Oriental.

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Regie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $112 - raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is again borrowing 19,000 PHP which she intends to use as additional capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and pay for her children's education.

Her husband, Nolito B., 72, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children ranging in age from 33 to 47 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nEmma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family.  With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,400, thereby uplifting the family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy another pig for fattening and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of their sugarcane field. Emma B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

M.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Juanito has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Juanito joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business. He has successfully repaid his last loan from HSPFI, which was for 7,000 PHP and was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nJuanito is now requesting his fourth loan from HSPFI, for 10,000 PHP, which will be used to to expand the business. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Tita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

O. is from the village of Omonay, Damulog Bukidnon. She is 48 years old. Noemi is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Noemi owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Noemi has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Noemi joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Noemi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Noemi is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Noemi from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":557662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

O. is a married woman who lives in the Kanggapas zone of Anahaw village in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a sugarcane business. Her husband Guillermo, who is 45 years old, works as a truck driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 13 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAgnes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Agnes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to buy sugarcane fertilizer and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for their future and do home repairs. Agnes O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in the Kanggapas zone of barangay Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her oyster farming business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,500. \n\nMinife is now borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can buy materials that she needs to sustain her oyster farm such as oyster shells, bamboo and straps. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom.  Minife aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

A. is a married woman who lives in the Kanggapas zone of barangay Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: general store and pig fattening businesses. Her husband Dionie A., who is 50 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have five children who range in age from 6 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,700 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to buy more hogs and stocks for her general store so that she can continue saving up for their future and her children's education. Rosalie A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":552990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is a married woman who lives in zone 2, Basak, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  farming, hog-raising and tricycle businesses. Her husband Norberto, who is 49 years old, works as a farmer and a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 6 to  24 years old. \n\nElizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elizabeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 40,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 17,500 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \n\nThis time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 40,000. She intends to use the loan to purchase fertilizers, feeds and gasoline, so that she can continue saving up for their future by acquiring their own land to be used in sugarcane planting, and for their children to complete their education. Elizabeth A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":553078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

V. is a married woman who lives in zone 2, barangay Nabulao, Sipalay, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling rice, being an Avon dealer and running a pig fattening business. Her husband Edwin V., who is 47 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children, who are 20 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nImelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,080 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,500, which she intends to use to buy rice and other feeds so that she can continue saving for their future and expand the business. Imelda V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

F. is a 55 year old married woman who supports her family by raising livestock and engaging in buying and selling of rice grains. She lives in Prk Bamandayan, Barangay Buenavista, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental with her 53 year old husband, Inocenioa, a carpenter, and their 7 children who are between 16 and 37 years old. Three of their children already have their own families. The other 3 are already working and help their parents. They still have one child currently going school.\r\n\r\nHilda has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her livestock raising and buying and selling of rice grains business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.\r\n\r\nHilda is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can add additional working capital to her business re-open her general store. This will be her 17th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Hilda aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

A. is a 33-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures:  a General Store and Farming. She lives in Prk. Maligaya, Barangay Malingin, Bago City, Negros Occidental.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP7,000. Ailen is now borrowing PHP 28,000 so that she can buy more fertilizer and inventory for the general store.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ailen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":555678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a General Store and Pig fattening. \r\n\r\nLetecia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,300 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 22nd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy more inventory for her general store business. This will allow her to continue to save up for their future and for the expansion of their business. Letecia M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":555876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 14500 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Daisy from PMPC.

D. is a married woman who lives in Prk. 4, Brgy. Basak, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sugarcane plantation, a corn plantation and charcoal selling. Her husband Pablito, who is 58 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 12 children who are 11 to 35 years old.\r\n\r\nAnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 20,000. She intends to use it to buy and sell charcoal so that she can continue to save up for their future and to send their children to school and expand her business. Anita D. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":555889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Enclaro Vista Aligre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and nipa (palm leaves that are woven together and used as roofing material). Her husband, Leopoldo, who is 56 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 10 to  24 years old. \r\n\r\nRosie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000 \u2014 increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to lease nipa so that she could continue to save up for their future.

A. is a married woman who lives in Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Brgy. San Pedro, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, pump boat and pedicab.  Her husband, Nelson, who is 39 years old, works as a pedicab driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are 9 and 10 years old. \r\n\r\nAleciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aleciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Emma has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase pesticides and fertilizers. Emma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to pay services extended by laborers plowing her corn field. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Emma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is 44 years old. He is married with three children. Five years ago, Mirahror, with his mechanic skills, started to do work for his neighbors and acquaintances. He learned this skill at another shop, until he had the opportunity to begin his own business. \r\n\r\nWith faith and enthusiasm, his auto-mechanic business started to grow little by little. Villagers who use machines for their business always come to have their machines repaired by him. Now, Mirahror is finding that the tools he has are not enough to work at his job with full speed. For this reason, he is seeking a loan of 7,500 Somoni. This loan will be use to buy tools and materials used to repair autos. With your help, Mirahror will be able to provide for his children's education and for the well-being of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nematullo works the fields with the support of his wife and children, who are also dedicated to the production. \r\n\r\nThis family has been perfecting and modernizing their production processes. The maintenance of the land has a high cost, due to the attention that must be given to the plants in each phase of the productive process: manually weeding, using organic fertilizer and using natural supplements for the control of diseases. These give better yields for their crops, since they prevent the soil from deteriorating so much, provide better conditions for cultivation at planting time and improve the quality of the crop, increasing its value since organic products currently obtain better prices in the market. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, Nematullo also runs a transportation business with his lorry (truck). Nematullo requests a loan for the purchase of supplies for his crops, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. Part of the loan he will use for paying for the partial repair of his lorry. The loan will greatly improve Nematullo\u2019s income and his family's living standards.   \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L. is from the village of Kitingting, Damulog Bukidnon. She is 35 years old, married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Arlyn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Arlyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arlyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Mahmud is 48 years old and lives with his wife and four children. His plans for his family are to improve their quality of life and give a better education to all his children. \r\n\r\nMahmud began working in the fields two years ago. It was his father who taught him how to work with the earth. Mahmud works in farming and also raises cattle, which he sells to bring in extra income. With this loan he will buy farming supplies so his harvest will be good and he can sell it for a good price in the market. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abdukosim has been baking traditional bread since childhood. He inherited this skill from his father and grandfather. His working day starts at 4 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. For the first time, Abdukosim kneads dough from 2 sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The summer is an important period for his business, as citizens have many weddings and other family events. He needs to have a stock of flour and coal. For this reason Abdukosim applied to IMON International for a loan of 9000 Somoni. Abdukosim and his family appreciate your support in helping him improve his business.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

With these profits, Epiphanie will reinvest more in her business and improve the lifestyle of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":557891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchasing variety of goods which include cosmetics and foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"RUHENGELI","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epiphanie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782085,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159710004,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037352,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172309059,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616663,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622863,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760687,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":38136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497619,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T18:23:44Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209376,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan M.

Her dream is to have a cybercaf\u00e9, but at the moment she is not able to achieve this goal due to a lack of resources.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":557904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase electronic loads & pay for tricycle repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.19,"local_amount":1203.79,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1285.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761810,"comment":null},{"amount":29.07,"local_amount":581.42,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":621.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256715,"comment":null},{"amount":29.18,"local_amount":583.51,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":623.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802711,"comment":null},{"amount":29.47,"local_amount":589.44,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":629.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956543,"comment":null},{"amount":29.47,"local_amount":589.46,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":629.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685661,"comment":null},{"amount":29.38,"local_amount":587.56,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":627.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191424803,"comment":null},{"amount":29.4,"local_amount":588.03,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":628.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195843776,"comment":null},{"amount":29.33,"local_amount":586.56,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":626.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201285911,"comment":null},{"amount":58.72,"local_amount":1174.48,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206154064,"comment":null},{"amount":25.79,"local_amount":515.75,"processed_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":550.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211226988,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T04:21:01Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:14:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209382,"name":"Angelique","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelique was born in 1978 and is married with 3 children aged between 6 and 12 years.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Rejelyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rejelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Rejelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Rejelyn from HSPFI.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.

Ginalyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Ginalyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Ginalyn from HSPFI.

This district is known for its Afro-Peruvian dances and traditions, and is located 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband have a mototaxi (a motorcycle with a transportation cabin attached) and have been offering a freight and passenger transport service for more than ten years. Her husband drives the vehicle and everyday he travels around the town of  Za\u00f1a, the nearby district of Cayalt\u00ed and other neighbouring areas. This work is their only source of income, so they always try to work the longest possible hours.\r\n\r\nTherefore, due to the poor condition of the area's roads and the continuous use of the vehicle, it has begun to suffer a few mechanical faults which require urgent repair in order for it to run properly. This is why Amelia has requested a loan of $725 (2000 'nuevos soles') from Edpyme Alternativa, which she hopes to spend on the repair and maintenance of the mobile unit, as well as the purchase of various accessories for it.\r\n\r\nAmelia is known by her neighbours to be a quiet and trustworthy person.

She lives in her own house, together with her husband and three children. She sells vegetables in one of the markets in the area where she lives. She starts work early in the morning and finishes at 4 in the afternoon. The time she takes off during the day is just enough to have some lunch. Peak sales occur at about 11 in the morning, which is when all the housewives visit her stall to buy the food they need for preparing the mid-day meal. To satisfy demand, she always seeks to ensure she has the freshest produce. In the future, she would like to improve her stall. She also hopes to renovate the wooden structures of her stall, to make it look more attractive to customers.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lilibeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Lilibeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She shares her life with her husband, Ivan, 65, and they live together in their own home. Since they were both very young the couple has worked selling artesanal goods, an activity that their 2 children have inherited, having now established their own stall and working at the same activity. The most frequent work Consuela and Ivan do is making very large statues of saints for Christmas and for churches and chapels. Apart from this, Consuela also has her own business selling small statues of the baby Jesus, which she sells by order. This is less work because of the statues' size, but this doesn't mean it's less difficult as the statues are very detailed - putting in place the mix into the moulds and closing them with great precision so that both sides are in harmony and the image is modelled well. Later the moulds are sculpted and given the finishing touches necessary. This is the couple's third loan with MFP, and as usual they will be very punctual with the repayments. With this loan they will purchase the materials necessary to finish the orders that they have waiting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":558093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase material to make statues to fill an order ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Consuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":152.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":165.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":172.1},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":128.82,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673485,"comment":null},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":130.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887304,"comment":null},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":132.72,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":137.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154315,"comment":null},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":141.4,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449613,"comment":null},{"amount":52.93,"local_amount":144.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":149.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588314,"comment":null},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":154.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724816,"comment":null},{"amount":244.56,"local_amount":666.97,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":691.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463005,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T01:47:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209469,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Regina, tiene 54 a\u00f1os, es casada, tiene cinco hijos y es natural de Huambutio.

He has worked as a taxi driver for 23 years, but when he saw that the needs of his family were growing he decided to start up a new business. In this way he began selling fruit and vegetables.  He sells every day in the different street markets in his community.  Pedro goes out to stock his business with fruit and vegetables at 3 in the morning so that he can find the best prices and high quality products, since that is how you build a customer base.  The best selling days are Sundays, and when there are things that don't sell, he gives them to the people who are in need so that they don't spoil.  Pedro plans to get another fruit and vegetable stall so that he can give his son a good future.\r\n\r\nWith the loan that has been provided, he decided to invest in canvas covers, blankets, fruit and vegetables.  With the earnings he obtains he wants to do maintenance on his truck, since this is the way that he transports his merchandise.\r\n\r\nLas Cari\u00f1ositas feel very fortunate that the lenders of Kiva are willing to lend their assistance so that they can succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":558022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy canvas covers, blankets, fruit, vegetables, lingerie and shoe catalogs, clothing and supplies to make Mexican snacks  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Valle De Chalco Solidaridad  Estado De Mexico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brenda Tania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janeth Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":693.75,"local_amount":8625,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8651.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899588,"comment":null},{"amount":1246.92,"local_amount":15502.29,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15549.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639933,"comment":null},{"amount":926.63,"local_amount":11520.24,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11555.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854215,"comment":null},{"amount":832.7,"local_amount":10352.47,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10383.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121112,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T22:08:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":209471,"name":"Mujeres Sin Fronteras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA SRTA.
