Gloria is one of the members, and she is very pleased with her group and the loans that they received, and the fact that they are completing each loan cycle successfully.\r\n\r\nGloria works selling notions (sewing and craft supplies), and she invests every loan that she receives in her business so that she can expand it and have everything that her customers need when they visit her store.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy merchandise such as notions, consumer goods, gifts, notebooks, pens, all types of paper, handbags and other items.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to all of the people who make this project possible, since it is very useful for the women who belong to the various groups.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":601972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise: notions, stationery goods, consumer goods, appliqu\u00e9s, gift arrangements, and decorations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-09-20T04:40:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sof\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirtha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virigina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blasida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":17342040,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1083878},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1083870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1368.75,"local_amount":6503268,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6510599.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119743,"comment":null},{"amount":2281.25,"local_amount":10838772,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10850990.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413728,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Her family includes her husband and their four children who are 21-, 17-, 13, and 11-years old, respectively.  Juana's business is very profitable because there's only one other business like hers in the town.  Juana is applying for this loan so that she can stock her business with the products she sells (rice, sugar, beans, butter, churros, cookies, flour, soap, cleaning products, bread, coffee, etc.).  She wants her customers to be able to find the products they need so that her shop will be the first one they come to.  Juana wants to grow her business so that she, in turn, can provide her children with a good education and the best opportunities available to them.

He has operated the business for 10 years now, but only bought it outright 1 year ago.  This is Harold's second Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan, a loan that he will use to buy larger volumes of the meats and cold drinks that his customers will want for year-end parties.  Harold has been able to use his connection with the bank to learn new business skills and legalize his business.

For the past three years she\u2019s been selling a well-known brand of beauty products through catalogs and samples.  She offers personalized service to her customers and visits them in their homes or places of work.  This gives her a great advantage in her sales.  She then collects payment according to the agreed upon terms.\r\n\r\nShe likes working in her business because it allows her to have the income she needs to support her daughter, but she still risks selling to people who will not make their payments.  Her greatest desire is to have a stand where she can offer a greater amount of products and more services, such as announcements or photography.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan through MFP and she is happy to know that she has financial support, now that they know that she is responsible with her payments.  She is also happy to be part of a communal bank because she knows all of the members and they are all united and responsible people.  She is also grateful to those who make this loan possible, which will be very helpful to her business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to invest in cosmetics and perfumes, because they are being offered at a lower price when purchased in quantity.  She also wants to buy a camera so that she can begin her photography business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":602149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449948,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":62.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588648,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725153,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":62.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463246,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886658,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195563,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":125.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269329,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":62.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549432,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":62.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718165,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-03T09:07:51Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":232118,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa T. cooks 'Fante kenkey' (a staple made of fermented corn dough sold wrapped in banana leaves) at Elmina.

On the other hand, she also raises small farm animals and farms corn, lima beans and peas.  When planting and harvest times come is when the hardest effort is required to do a good job. The crops are sold in the city market.  For now, she\u2019d like to extend her fields as well as have a workshop with the latest model sewing machines to facilitate the jobs.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with MFP.

They are accustomed to the habit of meeting every Sunday afternoon so that they could help one another and learn how to build their committee.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Emilia is one of the members who sell clothing.  With the arrival of a new season, she wants to increase her earnings by purchasing in quantity so that she can obtain the wholesale price.  By acquiring clothes for spring and summer at a lower cost, she hopes to generate more revenue.  Emilia has been in this business for some time and wants to continue so that she can help with the family expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHer vending post is located at her house, but she also travels to the homes of her acquaintances to sell her merchandise.

He is a hard-working young man, and is well-regarded by his neighbors.  He began working at the age of 12 because his parents could not afford to send him to school.  Presently, Carlos sells all kinds of accessories for cell phones, as well as movies and sunglasses.  He sells them every day on foot, traveling large distances.

Her husband, Benjie B., 37, works as a teacher, and they have three children ranging in age from one week to eleven years old. <p>\r\n\r\nMay Jane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, May Jane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for her family's future needs and home improvements. May Jane B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p> \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

With the help of eleven previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Noeta she has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She now earns enough money to have significantly improved her family's standard of living.

She lives in Napulo, Brgy Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental and has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002. Thanks to hard work and loans from NWTF, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Rogelia has applied for a new loan, her 13th, for PHP 19,500 so that she can buy more materials for her business.  She has repaid all her previous loans on time, and expects to do the same with this one. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Camantigue, Brgy Old Sagay, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: tailoring and ready-to-wear clothes businesses. Her husband, Edgar A., who is 52 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have seven children who are between the ages of 9 and 27 years old.\r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $70, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials for tailoring so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Wilma A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

G. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Bal-os, Basay, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a pig fattening business and a buying and selling of livestock business. Her husband, Richard G., who is 36 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children between the ages of 13 and 22.\r\n\r\nMeredith joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Meredith has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $645, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more feed and vitamins for their pig fattening business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for the future purchase of new assets. Meredith G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

De Agua, Brgy. Cubay, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, E-loading and a pig fattening business.  Her husband, Edgardo, who is 41 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 3 years old. \r\n\r\nHermie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hermie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $97, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store and feed for her pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child, do home repairs and expand her businesses. Hermie M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures. She runs a pig fattening business and she also buys and sells sweetened fried bananas. Her husband, Leonardo, who is 56 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have ten children between the ages of 7 and 28. \r\n\r\nMa. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $212, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more pigs for future savings and stock for their fried banana business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and uplift their living conditions. Ma. Helen F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

P. is a married woman who lives in Santa Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fishing  business.  Her husband, Elenito P., who is 47 years old, works as a plumber to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children between the ages of 3 and 24. Three of them have their own jobs while the other four children are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 23,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $342, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000PHP which she intends to use to buy fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

M. is a 40-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fish vending business. She lives in Sitio. Tagasa, Brgy. Bitoon, Daanbantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $210. Jessica is now borrowing 15,000 PHP to use as additional working capital. This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJessica  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating an abaca weaving business. (The abaca plant has numerous uses and by products.) Her husband Helario G., who is 43 years old, works as a weaver to earn his living. Adeliza has four children between the ages of 8 and 16. The eldest is already working and the other three are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAdeliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adeliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $136, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 11,000 PHP which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve their living conditions, expand the business and pay for the education of her children. Adeliza G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: abaca (a plant fiber) weaving and farming. Her husband Dionson H., who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. She has six children who range from 11 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nSulpicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sulpicia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,400, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional stock so that she can continue to save up for the future education of their children and improve their living conditions. Sulpicia H. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Tontonon, Masaba, Danao City, Cebu.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her abaca weaving business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nGinalyn is now borrowing PHP 16,000 so that she can purchase raw materials for her business. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nGinalyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and assure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at a retail rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nRose dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

They have a 14 year old child who currently goes to school. Lorelie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009, because she aspired for something better for her family.\r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorelie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more raw materials for her weaving business so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family, as well as having enough set aside to invest in other business ventures so that she can continue to improve her family's living condition.

This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more feed and vitamins so that she can continue to save up for their future, improve their business and for her children to finish their education.  Adelita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

B. is a 33-year-old single woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Laundry Service businesses. She lives in Ampalaya, Brgy. Gun-ob, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store and laundry service businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. Carmen is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 15th  loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\n Carmen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Cabacungan, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Dressmaking \/ Sewing, Ready-to-Wear Clothes and Food Vending businesses.  \r\n\r\nEva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,700, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 which she intends to use to buy stock for her Ready-to-Wear Clothes inventory and materials for sewing so that she can continue to save up for the  future.  \r\n\r\nEva N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Poblacion, Sibonga, Cebuis, is a 44-year old married woman who supports her family by operating an electronic re-loading  business.  A member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008, her living conditions have improved with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her electronic re-loading  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable and now earns an average monthly income of PHP3,500. <p>\r\n\r\nElizabeth is now receiving her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon in the amount of PHP10,000 as additional working capital. Her previous loan of PHP10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Elizabeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Tabuan, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and buying and selling rice & corn businesses.  Josefa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP13,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve the business and uplift their standard of living. \r\n\r\nJosefa D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He has been farming for 30 years and has employed one farmhand. His farm produces arrowroot, yams, sweet potatoes, maize and fruits, which he sells at a local market. He also practices small-scale farming of coffee and tea, which he sells through the coffee factory and the Kenya Tea Development Authority respectively. He also depends on the income from his pension, a home-based museum and a quarry to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45,000 Kenyan shilings from Juhudi Kilimo to venture into fish farming and poultry farming. He says that these projects will increase his sources of income and will enable him to pay school fees for his children and expand other projects on his farm. He faces the challenges of diseases and a lack of financing and markets for his products. In the future, he plans to expand his fish ponds so that he can be able to harvest fish in tonnes.

This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements and home repairs. \r\n\r\nCornelia B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.

Ca\u00f1ete is a married woman who lives in Prk. 1, Brgy. San Jose, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a coffee shop, tricycle transport, and buying scrap. Her husband Romeo, who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver. They have nine children between eight and 30. \r\n\r\nNemie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy hollow blocks, cement, and piglets so that she can start something new and continue to save up for the education of her children. Nemie Ca\u00f1ete is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Trinidad joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Trinidad has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to purchase more fertilizer for the rice field and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve her standard of living. Trinidad D. A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Nu\u00f1ez is a 45-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a business venture; a dress shop  business.  She lives in Purok 1, Brgy. 2, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her dress shop business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP9,000. \r\n\r\nMa. Elena is now borrowing  PHP15,000 so that she  could  purchase raw materials. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Elena aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Burulush\u2019s husband is engaged in farming.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, Burulush lost her job. That is why in 1995, Burulush began to engage in stock-breeding using the 20,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS) that she had put aside for a rainy day. At that time, she had only two calves. Gaining experience in cattle breeding, Burulush broadened her business and today owns 24 sheep, one milk cow, one calf and one horse. She also began to cultivate a plot of land with potatoes, kidney beans and perennial herbs.  \r\n\r\nBurulush is a really hard-working woman. Her striving to provide her children with a better life motivated her to apply for a loan of 60,000 KGS for cattle breeding. She used her loan as intended and repaid it without any delays. \r\n\r\nNow, Burulush has decided to apply for a second loan of 60,000 KGS. She will use it to buy more milk cows.

T. is a married woman who lives in Jesusito Village, Brgy. San Jose, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport  business.

They have four children who range from 10 to 25 years old.  \r\n\r\nJohaida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Johaida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase one motorcycle with a sidecar so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nJohaida T. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Hda. Carmen, Brgy. Daan Banua, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nJoelinda has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Joelinda is now borrowing 13,000 PHP so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Joelinda hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 41, married and has three children. Two of them are students and the youngest son is a schoolboy. She graduated from Osh State University with the major in Kyrgyz philology (the study of literary texts and written records). Taking into account that salaries of teachers are very low and do not cover expenses of the families, Aynash decided to start her own business in shoe sales. She started with the sum of only 600 Kyrgyz soms (KGS) and bought several rubber boots for reselling. Aynash explored every avenue in her wish to support her children and achieved success \u2013 her two little shops became known by their wide assortments of shoes, where every client could find his favorite model.  \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Aynash lost her business, which was fully destroyed. Her shops were robbed and looted. \r\n\r\nIn spite of this severe test she went through, Aynash is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Aynash is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase shoes to resell at the local market. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

They have two children, who are 15 and  22 years old and currently going to school. \r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future, to help her husband with their daily needs, to improve her living conditions and to educate the children. \r\n\r\nIn the photo is Wilma and her husband. Wilma E. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Her two eldest children are already finished college and currently working professionally, the third eldest is a graduating student taking up criminology and her youngest is in his 1st year college. Every year, the education of Nelida's children incurs more financial expenses. Nelida's business had been very helpful to supplement these expenses and has enabled her children to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nNelida has been in the hog fattening business for more than 10 years. The hogs are raised for approximately four to six months until they are ready for sale. After four months of raising or fattening, the pigs will be sold either alive or slaughtered for their meat per kilo.\r\n\r\nNelida's membership in ASHI and the support of her loving husband and children enabled her to put this together and see it grow. Despite financial struggles, Nelida proved her trustworthiness and well-defined values by showing good performance in terms of her repayments, attendance and business.\r\n\r\nRecently, Nelida, her husband and her children decided to apply for a loan with ASHI to enhance her business further to earn a larger profit. The whole family agreed on the idea of buying more pigs to raise and have bigger profit. Aside from intending Nelida's loan for her primary business, they also plan to support and enhance their fish selling business for an alternative income source.\r\n\r\nThrough the profit of Nelida's hog fattening business, she aspires to invest in her home; the profit from her fish selling business will be intended for her weekly payments to ASHI, her family's daily needs, and children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":608,"image":{"id":603178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She is 43 years old. Janet is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Janet B..\r\n\r\nJanet is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Janet owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Janet is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Janet joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janet is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Janet from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Medina, Misamis Oriental. He is 58 years old and single. To make a living, he operates a barber shop, providing hair cutting services to local community members. He has been engaged in his business for over thirty-five years and earns approximately $225 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rustico joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide the service. \r\n\r\nRustico is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be his 3rd loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She wants to renovate their home, enjoy a good life and have the financial means to support her family and fund the college education of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nShe also dreams of having a pump boat to be managed by her eldest child, Jovan, who already has his own family. She hasn\u2019t stop dreaming for her children to have their own businesses like she does. Belsie wants to thank ASHI and Kiva lenders who are sponsoring this loan.

She is 55 years old. She is married and has three adult children. To make a good living, Florinda owns and operates a vegetable vending business at Trade Town of San Jose. Florinda has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns good profits for these activities. In 1999, Florinda aimed to join ASHI to secure access to financial services to help improve her living condition and to have the ability to engage in more business activities. Florinda has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI. Since she was able to repay her previous loan, she is now qualified to apply for another loan with a higher amount than the first one she had. Now, she plans to utilize this and future loans in the same business until it grows. She wishes that some day, she can put up her own stall, not rent in the public market, so that her income will increase and she will be able to give her customers convenient purchases in their village that is far away from the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of this KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambitions to step out from under the umbrella of poverty, develop her business, and provide for the needs of her grandchildren in school.\r\n\r\nFlorinda's aspiration for all of her children is for them to have a decent living, and this is the reason she wants her business to succeed. Her loan in ASHI is a very important factor that could lead her towards fulfillment. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Florinda is hopeful that her business ventures will continue to grow and improve the overall standard of living for her entire family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":624,"image":{"id":603271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To

Consolacion is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Consolacion from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

H. is a 62-year-old loving mother of four children whose ages range from 21 to 31 years old, and a member of KIVA field partner in the Philippines, ASHI. She is requesting a greater loan amount to overcome the financial deficit which hinders the growth of her business and its profit, as well as her dream of improving her family's lifestyle. \r\n\r\nHermosa\u2019s supportive husband, Domingo H., is a fisherman. The income he gets out of his fishing is small and sporadic, therefore, Hermosa has to do her part of earning to achieve her simple dream in life: to provide a better living for her children, who currently live in poverty. Loan access is her only hope of reaching her goal.\r\n\r\nA proud member of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva microfinance partner in the Philippines, since 2002, Hermosa has demonstrated regular attendance at weekly meetings and steady repayments on previous loans.\r\n\r\nHermosa\u2019s dreams are to expand her fishing business and eventually invest in more fishing equipment so that someday she will provide employment to others.  With the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders, she aspires to grow her business and generate steady income to support her family\u2019s long term financial
