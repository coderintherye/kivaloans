B., 52, has now been running his poultry-rearing and transport service business for 12 years in Nakasozi-Mpigi. Being relentlessly steadfast, resolute and purposeful in his business operations has enabled him to obtain a footing in his business. This former government employee and happy-go-lucky married father of seven sturdy-looking children says he initially reared chickens for home consumption. Upon learning of poultry's commercial possibilities he made the decision to start this enterprise which, with time, has proven to be lucrative. \r\n\r\nIshaka also runs a rental business, and both enterprises earn him a monthly income of 1,100,000 shillings.  His current situation of supporting family and relatives has not favored the expansion of his business, as he has to shoulder the responsibilities of providing welfare for many people. He is very optimistic, however, that with a loan, he will be able to buy more chicken feed for his young sprouting chicks and also more chickens.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife is his biggest supporter. She helps him in anything she can and takes good care of him and the house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is very hardworking woman. She tries to make more money for the family by working hard each day. About 15 years ago, she decided to start raising and selling animals. This way Muhabbat pays for the education of her children who have high hopes for the future. She raises calves and later sells them according to her clients' demand at the markets. She prepares them ready to eat for the eating pleasure of the people in her country.\r\n\r\n Since Muhabbat hopes for a great future, she decided to expand her businesses with the sole purpose of improving her family's living conditions and to help pay for her children's education so that they can one day become good citizens in society. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.

Rajabboy was born in 1948 in B.Gafurov region, where he now works as a farmer. He is married and has 3 children. His main business is agriculture, which provides him with the means to meet the needs of his family. Rajabboy owns a large piece of land where he cultivates different kinds of vegetables, but due to the poor quality of the soil and the insects, he is no longer able to satisfy market demand. Very hard-working, he is asking for a loan of 5000 Somoni to buy seeds, fertilizer and also calves. The loan will greatly improve Rajabboy\u2019s income and his family's living standards. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The best sales are on the weekends and during the holiday season as this is when she sells the most soft drinks.  She has been doing this for eight months and is very happy and wants to succeed.  Ale has many plans, as much for her personal life as for her business, however the most important thing is that her daughters succeed at finishing school and to enlarge her sales area.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan that she is requesting to buy merchandise like soft drinks, soap, oil, sweets, etc., and in this way increase her clientele.  With her earnings she will buy necessities for her daughters.  El M\u00e1rquez is grateful for Kiva's support through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad since this will help them to reach their goals. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva

She is 19 years old, and she lives with her young child in the Guadalupe district, Pacasmayo province.  This area belongs to the La Libertad region.  It is over one hour from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young she has sold tamales (a native dish in many Latin America countries; which consists of dough made from ground corn, filled with meat, and wrapped in banana leafs).  She prepares the product at her home, and she sells them at the Guadalupe city market.  Sometimes she also traverses the district streets to sell her merchandise.  With the income from this business she helps her husband, who works in Lima, with the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nDiana wishes to expand her business with the purchase of more supplies.  That way she will be able to increase her production, and her sales will also increase.  To achieve this objective she believes it is advisable to request a loan for 700 soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to keep growing as a businesswoman and to guarantee her young child of a stable and prosperous future.  She is always working hard to get ahead and progress.  The people who know her consider her to be a tenacious woman who is devoted to her family.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows her making the dough for the tamales before it is cooked.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":591711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies to make tamales to incease production in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Guadalupe - Pacasmayo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-27T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":76.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":88.94},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":90.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":95.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":97.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.19,"local_amount":76.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":84.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166833010,"comment":null},{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":81.52,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":89.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099620,"comment":null},{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":142.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":156.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108275,"comment":null},{"amount":37.38,"local_amount":95.16,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270411,"comment":null},{"amount":78.3,"local_amount":199.3,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":218.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211211244,"comment":null},{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":104.53,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":114.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489740,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-27T22:09:12Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:55:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227149,"name":"Unidas Venceremos 4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jisela is the coordinator of her group, Unidas Venceremos 4 (United we'll win).

She lives in her own home with her husband Edwin, who is 27, and her dear daughter Daniela, who is 2.  They are the motive for all her efforts.\r\n\r\nWorking arduously, Ada has been able to advance her sowing.  Every morning she rises very early to water and offer the respective care to her crops.  She takes her products to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, where the vetch, beans, and corn that she cultivates are rapidly bought.  What Ada likes best about her work is enjoying the liberty of laboring in her fields.  In time, she hopes to be able to buy more land in order to expand her production.\r\n\r\nThis is Ada's 2nd loan with MFP.  She is certain that this loan will help her with the progress and development of her business.  That's why she is so disposed to make all her payments punctually.  In her communal group, Ada is a very responsible member, for which reason she is much loved.  The 2,000 new sols she requests will be invested in buying manure.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":591757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"BUYING MANURE FOR HER FIELDS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2025.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195519,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-02T16:25:51Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227181,"name":"Maame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maame B. is married and has three children.

What she most enjoys about her work is talking with her fellow sales people and finding out about the goings-on of the market. She has been doing this work for 13 years and finds the greatest difficulty to be the transportation of her products, since the trip is very long and tiring. In the future, she hopes to hire a helper and with this support be able to better attend to her customers. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and feels that she has an obligation to pay all of her quotas punctually. In her community group she is a very responsible member, and thus she is very respected by the rest of the members. With the 500 soles she is requesting, she will purchase more apples in order to better stock her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":591826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to stock up with apples and other fruits ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":90.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":76.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":85.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154560,"comment":null},{"amount":31.62,"local_amount":79.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":88.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449872,"comment":null},{"amount":32.73,"local_amount":81.84,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":91.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588574,"comment":null},{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":84.73,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":94.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725076,"comment":null},{"amount":35.09,"local_amount":87.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":98.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463176,"comment":null},{"amount":36.13,"local_amount":90.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886582,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T19:11:21Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227219,"name":"Rosa Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa Delia tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, por lo que tiene 3 hijos pero todos trabajan de manera independiente.

With great effort, Carmen was able to recuperate financially after she fell ill and was unable to run her suitcase sales store. She now has a telephone booth in the wholesale market of Tarma city, where she offers nation-wide and international calls. This has been very profitable and beneficial, as it is in a strategic location where there are many customers. She most enjoys attending to her customers, and her children occasionally help her with customer service.

With time, she hopes that her business will grow and offer her better income. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to repay all her quotas on time; she is ready to do so, since she does not want to drag her community group down.

Since beginning four years ago she has greatly expanded not only her area of business, but has also taken on a managerial role with several other product sellers working underneath her. Yessica enjoys being her own boss and having the ability to work with different clients and other product sellers. \r\n\r\nOriginally from El Salvador, Yessica and her husband moved to the United States with their daughters 7 years ago. Due to their lack of credit, Yessica approached ACCION USA in order to find financing for her business and help provide financial support for her family.\r\n\r\nThis is Yessica\u2019s third loan with ACCION USA. She wants to use it to buy more products in bulk in order to sell them at a better price and expand her business. She also wants to be able to continue growing her clients' confidence in her product. This loan will increase her abilities as a businesswomen and help her continue to enhance her position within the beauty product market. \r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Information About This Loan \r\n\r\nKiva realizes that access to credit is a challenge for entrepreneurs everywhere. Kiva started out as a website focused on developing-world entrepreneurs. In June 2009, Kiva began experimenting with allowing entrepreneurs in the United States to raise money on its website.

B., who is the treasurer of the group \u201cLas estrellas del sur\u201d [\"The Stars of the South\"], located in Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla, Mexico. In the photo, we can see the materials she uses to prepare handmaD. tortillas, which she sells. She has operated this business for 4 years. Her customers say that they buy tortillas from Esther because they are maD. with natural ingredients and also because they are always nice and hot. The client [Esther] is very happy with her loan, because she likes the idea that someone has confidence in her and her fellow members. She is 36 years old, and she has only had the opportunity to study up to secondary school, but this has not stopped her from getting ahead. She is the mother of 4 children, two girls and two boys. With the loan, she plans to continue investing in her tortilla business and expanding her number of customers. In addition, with the funds she will contract other women to help her, and she will feel happy about this since she is generating more jobs, while also providing for her children's education so that they can learn a profession and have better opportunities in life. \r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMayra Virginia  M.

Her husband works for the Water Association, which provides irrigation to local farmers.   After graduating from Trade College, Jiparbubu worked in the trade sector for many years. She is known as a very optimistic and hard-working person. \r\n  \r\nSince her family has limited resources, Jiparbubu decided to start her own business in cattle-breeding.  She bought a horse and one milch cow, whose milk she sold to the dairy factory. Also, Jiparbubu engaged in cultivating apples and kidney beans.  She purchased and planted seeds and worked hard to get a good harvest.  All these activities allowed Jiparbubu to broaden her farm with more cattle and grow a small-scale apple garden. \r\n\r\nJiparbubu will use her loan of 50,000 KGS to buy one milch cow and mineral fertilizers to fertilize the land with apple gardens. Using the revenue, she would like to acquire a drying machine to process her apples and those of other farmers. Jiparbubu believes that the loan will help her achieve new levels in her activities.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are so many people in the area doing the same kind of business as his and so customers are \"spoilt  for choice\". \r\n\r\nWeather, especially when it rains, also slows business making him not able to make as much profit as he would wish. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to increase his stock of clothes to meet the high demand by his customers. He hopes to diversify his business to property management some day.

Bananas are also highly perishable and so she has to sell fast lest they go bad before she can sell all of them. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 10,000 to buy more chickens to expand her business. In future, she hopes to become a wholesaler. She describes herself as sociable and polite."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":591998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Through this business, she was able to gain experience and establish a customer base.  She offers a few baked goods from the east (such as cheese rolls, rice bread, and other products) and tropical fruit juices.  Everything she offers helps to separate her business from the others.

 F. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Pungtod, Brgy. Caceres, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a retail  business selling frozen food products.  Her husband Rogelio F., who is 46 years old, works as a deliveryman to earn his living.  They have 6 children who are 16 to  27 years old. \r\n\r\nFeliciana  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Feliciana  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 49,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to purchase more frozen products to sell so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Feliciana  F. is a \"Dungganon\" woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Rolando S., who is 57 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living , and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are 10 to  23 years old. \r\n\r\nAna Belly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ana Belly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of  4000 PHP,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the education of children. Ana Belly S. is a \"Dungganon\" woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has 4 children.  The oldest, 20-year-old daughter is studying at a university and learned how to sew clothing from her mother.  Sadagat's 18-year-old daughter was accepted to a university this year, 16-year-old son is attending school and learning dancing, and 14-year-old daughter is also attending school.  Sadagat and her family live in the Absheron region.\r\n\r\nSadagat learned this sewing business from her neighbor, who saw that Sadagat had many children and advised her to make clothing for them herself in order not to spend a lot on it.  Sadagat decided to learn how to sew from her neighbor.  At the beginning, she only made clothing for her children, but then once others saw how nice and interesting her clothing was, they started asking her to sew for them too.  So Sadagat decided to become a seamstress.  She likes to create new things in her work.  Now she needs 2000 AZN in order to purchase a new sewing machine.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":592467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of a new sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Absheron region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sadagat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262598,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542538,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711058,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081423,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843095,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238655132,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609179,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250824201,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257234361,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263373736,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T09:38:35Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:15:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227399,"name":"Mai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mai T.

Avec  le cr\u00e9dit  de  l\u2019IMF Hekima, Kabuo Tahirana jeannine souhaite augmenter son chiffre d\u2019affaire en achetant 75 pairs de souliers usagers.

She has her hand raised in the photograph, she is a client of the sixteenth cycle, and she is 37 years old, married, and mother of 5 children all of whom attend school. Her husband has a small business, a pharmacy at Butembo, a commercial town situated in the Lubero territory which is over 410 kilometres from Goma\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana sells second hand shoes at the central market of Virunga,she set up  her small business with her own money ,a sum of about 50$ that she received from her husband. At that time she was selling fritters. After the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano from the 16th to the 17th of February 2002 which completely destroyed the economy and the basic infrastructure of the town of Goma, and of which she was one of the victims, she decided to change her activity and sell second hand shoes. She has been doing this for 8 years. With the loan from the IMF Hekima, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana hopes to increase her turnover by buying 75 pairs of used shoes .The main challenge of this activity is that the sale of merchandise (buying of shoes) depends on the availability of money (the revenue of the population).In addition the competition of shoes made in Uganda\/Kampala disrupts the prices.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana also practises small artisan activities, she weaves carpets to increase her income. In 10 years time, she hopes to become a wholesaler and no longer a small retailer. She aims to obtain her stock from the big commercial centre in either Kampala or Butembo.\r\nIn addition, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana is a tenant, she would like to buy a piece of land and build on it since her husband works a long way away from her, and this would allow her to reduce the burden of the family expenses.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana is grateful to the IMF Hekima for the loans that she receives without any physical security ,for thanks to these loans she can manage to provide for her children. This Twende Mbele group is made up of 14 women members one of whom is ill (J. Matunda) and E. Kavira who are not on the group photograph, which is why there are only 12 clients on the photograph.\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Barbara Belli,

With their loan, each member of this village bank hopes to increase his or her income to improve the living conditions of their family.\r\n\r\nMrs. Um S. is a farmer who owns a plot of land that she uses to cultivate peanuts and corn for a living.

He is responsible for a family, married, the father of two children. He is also responsible for two other relatives who are his wards. \r\n\r\nSince he did not succeed in his studies, he took up an apprenticeship as a tailor which is an activity he chose because he loves it. Thus, since 1994, he has been working full time at this trade, and four years ago he got his own workshop. He makes ready-to-wear and \"boubous\" (long flowing traditional robes worn by men and women) which are much in demand among Nigerians. \r\n\r\nMr. D. has been a member of the Baye Laye branch since May 2010. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs which will be totally used to fund the creation of ready-to-wear. This loan will bolster the working capital of Mr. D., who will then be able to meet the ever-growing demand of his clientele. The increase in profit will allow him to better support his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":592592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"making ready-to-wear clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-08-30T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484811,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182621054,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758626,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495528,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923495,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365913,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206230961,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-02T08:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211306150,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-21T07:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":41802.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216585152,"comment":null},{"amount":37.59,"local_amount":19277.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":19340.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244660835,"comment":null},{"amount":206.16,"local_amount":105722,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":106066.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250881669,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-30T17:57:36Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:29:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227458,"name":"Khudash","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"N.

Mahbuba is 50 years old and is divorced with one child. She runs a caf\u00e9 where she provides meals of the national cuisine, basically breakfast. The caf\u00e9 is located in her community which allows her to have many clients as she has no competitors in her territory. The business has generated a stable income for the last eight years.\r\n\r\nNow, Mahbuba is planning to purchase foodstuffs for her caf\u00e9 wholesale, like wheat, oil, potatoes, carrots, onions and oil. With this purpose in mind, she requests 1,200 USD.\r\n\r\nMahbuba had been provided with seven loans by IMON International and has proved herself to be a reliable client. Today she thanks all those supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 41 years old and lives in a common law marriage. He has two children who are 4 and 11 years old. Both children go to school. Antonio Pedro went to school until 4th grade and didn't finish due to lack of conditions. Besides his children, he also supports his two nephews who live in his home. \r\n\r\nAntonio was drafted for mandatory military service and served for three years (regular time). He moved to the Namaacha districted where he started working as an assistant at a carpentry shop. Due to his ambition, he decided to open his own shop at home. His best orders are beds, cupboards, doors, stands and tables. He has a monthly income of 8,000 to 10,000 meticais, depending mostly on his clientele. With his profits he started his construction. He hasn't been able to finish due to the elevated cost of materials and has requested loans from Hluvuku to continue construction. \r\n\r\nThis is Antonio's fifth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva in the amount of 25,000 meticais. He intends to buy construction materials (iron, bricks and cement) to finish the basic parts of his construction. The previous loans in the amount of 5,300, 8,000, 12,000 and 17,000 meticais were used for the same goal. He is very happy because he will move to his own home soon. He is also confident he will pay the loan back without a problem because he also has a monthly pension of 3,260 meticais.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

She is married and the mother of 5 children ranging from 13 to 24 years old. Only the three youngest go to school. She went to school until 4th grade but didn't finish due to lack of conditions. She doesn't support anyone and manages to save 1,000 meticais with the help of her husband who works in South Africa. \r\n\r\nRabeca left Gaza to the Namaacha District with her mother. She started going to school very late and dropped out when her mother lost her job. Years later she moved in with her husband and started renting a house. She then started her own business raising and selling chickens. She has a profit of 8,000 meticais when she sells wholesale to vendors and 6,000 when she sells by the unit to local costumers. \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva. She intends to increase the amount of chickens she raises. Her previous loans were in the amount of 9,200, 7,000, and 10,000 meticais and were used for the same goal. She is confident she will pay the loan back before it is due and request a new loan to build her own coop and leave the rental coop she uses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has five children ranging in age from 6 to 24 years old. Four of them go to school and the oldest daughter is already employed. She went to school until 6th grade and didn't finish due to pregnancy. She supports her in-laws who live with her. \r\n\r\nAfter her pregnancy she started working as maid. With her income she started her own business selling aluminum pots and pans. She currently owns a stand that sells aluminum pots and pans in the informal market that opens twice a week (Thursdays and Saturdays).  She makes 9,000 meticais per month and spends it in household expenses and saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nThis is Rosalina's fourth loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva, in the amount of 25,000 meticais. She intends to buy aluminum pots and pans to increase her inventory. Her previous loans were for 8,200, 15,000 and 20,000 meticais and were all used for the same purpose. She is confident she will pay the loan back ahead of time and request a new loan to purchase a car which would help her in her daily work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

After graduating from high school, he was accepted at IFAPA Maputo (Institute of Public Administration and Management), where he got a degree in Public Accountancy. When Ozias was younger, he moved with his family from Moamba to Namaacha, due to his father's work. There they got a place located 7 km away from the city, where they started to raise animals. This is where Ozias lives now, with his wife.\r\n\r\nHe has been working as a full-time Public Accountant for a year, earning 8.030mt per month, which allows him to support himself and his wife and save some money in the bank. This is Ozias' first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He plans to use the 20.000mt. to buy construction material (cement, sand, stones, etc) to build a new house and corral for his father. He's confident that he'll be able to pay back his loan in a timely manner, so that he can apply for another loan to expand his own corral, which is getting too small to accommodate the growing number

He is married and has three children ages 7 to 17 who all attend school.  Xavier attended school through high school, but did not continue due to the distance from his home to the university.  He lives in his own home and supports his parents who live in Zambezia, sending them 2.000.00mt every 6 months. \r\n\r\nXavier was recruited to be a soldier. He completed 2 years and then was called to do an intensive basic training course in the Armed Forces.  Today he is a police officer with the rank of criminal investigator (PIC).  He works two 24 hour shifts followed by two consecutive days of rest, earning 5.500.00mt per month. With his wife's help he was able to build a coop and begin raising chickens to increase his family's income.  However, he did not have sufficient funds and had many orders, so he came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request a loan to increase his flock.  He has raised 4X100 boxes of chicks, spending 30.000.00mt and with a profit of 10.000.00mt depending greatly on mortality rates and the time of sale. \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.  It is for 22.000.00mt which he will use to purchase chicks to increase his flock.  The previous loans were for 14.000.00mt, 15.000.00mt and 22.000.00mt, which were also used to raise chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

M. lives in Osh city, in the south of Kyrgyzstan.  She is the single mother of two children.  In 1993, in order to find a way to earn a living for her family, Zulaika began her business  in trade. She started selling woman\u2019s clothes at the market using her initial investment of 15,000 KGS. Due to supreme efforts and her strong determination to provide a better life for her children, Zulaika managed to multiply her investment and broaden her business by opening a second sales point at the local market. To widen her assortment of goods, Zulaika got her first loan, which was used as intended and repaid correctly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Zulaika lost her business, which was robbed and looted. But Zulaika didn\u2019t give way to despair and braced herself to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this reason, Zulaika is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity.  Zulaika believes that the only way out of different complicated situations is mutual understanding and moving forward together.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

is a married woman with four children: three girls who are ages 8, 5 and 3, and a boy who is 22 years old. The boy attends college while the other children are still in their lower classes. \r\n\r\nTabu has been operating her vegetable stall for the past eight years, selling vegetables to her neighbors and passersby. With the Kshs 40,000, she wants to pay college fees for her son, and purchase sacks of potatoes and a sack of coconuts. \r\n\r\nTabu faces the major challenge of high transportation costs, theft, and seasonality in her business.

The municipality is very close to Rio Magdalena, the longest river in Columbia and the primary source of water in the country. He has a stand where he sells beef meat, tripe and fish, as well as various other merchandise such as dresses and accessories. In this village he lives with his wife and their three children, aged between 13 and 20 years of age. \r\n\r\nManuel initially sold tripe and beef meat to his family but later he started selling to his closest neighbors. He later refashioned a table in his living room to store fish, a product that was highly sought out by his clients. Clients from other districts started to buy from him, given the high quality of his meat products. He has gradually expanded his business. This is the second loan he seeks through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). He will be able to provide his clients a better service. Prior to this he had very little capital to work with. His goal is to set up a store from where to sell meat products and in the future he would like to move his business to the downtown core of the village. He requests a loan to purchase greater quantities of meat from the butchers to supply his ever growing roster of clients. His dreams are to improve his business, and improve his earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

El cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para comprar libros para su hija que estudia medicina ya que ella se encuentra en el cuarto a\u00f1o de la carrera, el costo de los libros es muy caro por eso se vio en la necesidad de solicitar el cr\u00e9dito.\n\nGuillermo es cliente de impro con un historial de  seis cr\u00e9ditos; esta satisfecho con el servicio que prestamos.\n\nPor tener un buen historial y por la actividad califica para obtener un nuevo cr\u00e9dito.\n\n","en":"Guillermo lives in his own home in the region of Villa Nuevo Potosi in the city of La Paz. He is married and he has two children, one of whom already has a career and the other is studying to be a doctor. Guillermo's income is generated through a newspaper. He is a graphic artist and his wife works independently to help support the family. They have been Kiva clients in one past occasion. The loan that is requested will be used to purchase books for their daughter to study medicine. She is in her fourth year of her education and the price of the books is very expensive, which is why he saw the need to request a loan. \n\nGuillermo is a client of Impro (Kiva Field Partner) and he has had six past loans. He is very happy with the support he has received.\n\nFor having a good history, he is eligible to receive a new loan.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She lives in the Santa Elena town, departament of Usulut\u00e1n. She is married and lives with her husband and three children, aged 22,18 and 12, who depend on Gloria financially. She has a business selling food and pupusas. \n\nThe business was started by her own initiative, with her husband's help. She tends to the business regularly from  7:00am- 7:00pm. At this time, she faces difficulties because she doesn't have enough money to invest in the business. That is why she is asking for a loan to buy merchandise such as oil, chicken, vegetables, spices, and corn meal, which are necessary to prepare the food. This will contribute to improve business conditions and generate enough income to pay for the family's needs.  \n\nHer aspirations are to grow the business and support her family to improve their quality of life. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":592686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To buy merchandise such as oil, chicken, vegetables, spices, and corn meal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Santa Elena, Usulutan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-09-06T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Etel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.06},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.06},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":44.99,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":44.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162997,"comment":null},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":46.88,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":46.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458876,"comment":null},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":47.89,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":47.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596919,"comment":null},{"amount":60.64,"local_amount":60.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181649,"comment":null},{"amount":49.7,"local_amount":49.7,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":49.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474484,"comment":null},{"amount":399.9,"local_amount":399.9,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":399.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T15:01:54Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227526,"name":"Caterine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caterine K. is currently in the business of selling charcoal, bread and tomatoes at the gate of her home and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of charcoal to sell.

He is an agriculturist and a farmer.\r\n\r\nHe started his business when he was very young, following his parents' footsteps. His wife and the children help him cultivate the fields. He doesn't have a fixed schedule. The challenge they face is a deficit of funds to invest, which is the reason why he has requested a loan. He will purchase fertilizers and some heads of cattle. This will permit him to have a good harvest and therefore improve the family's income, unless the rains do not permit a good yield. \r\n\r\nHis aspirations are to be a large scale agriculturist to better support his family and to improve their quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":592697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":" compra de fertilizante y vacas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Rafael de Oriente, San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.43,"local_amount":77.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":77.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458877,"comment":null},{"amount":78.8,"local_amount":78.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":78.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181650,"comment":null},{"amount":81.36,"local_amount":81.36,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":81.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195900273,"comment":null},{"amount":262.41,"local_amount":262.41,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":262.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209650,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T16:01:59Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":227530,"name":"Nancy Edith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra Nancy nacida en la ciudad D.

She is 29 years old, and when she was 13 she learned how to weave backpacks with a neighbor.  This is currently her main activity because handicrafts have allowed her to earn money, take care of the household chores, and generate income.  Her husband is an elementary school teacher.  They dream and work persistently in order to get their four children ahead.  The children range in ages from two to ten.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy a greater volume of yarn to weave the backpacks and handbags.  That way she will be getting new customers, and she will start on her dream of having a handicraft place for storage.  It will have the raw material for making her beautiful indigenous backpacks and hammocks, which are very well known.  With the profits, she aspires to generate more income for her family\u2019s well-being, to finish building her house, and that her children become professionals in the future.\r\n\r\nShirley says that in her business she has had many challenges that she learned from.
