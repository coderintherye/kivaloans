Her store is her only source of income. At first she only sold soft drinks but soon she saw that she earned a good income, so she decided to sell other products as well. She has been running this business for the past 16 years and throughout she has enjoyed the support of Fundacion Leon 2000 (Kiva Field Partner), and organization that has granted her various loans. Juana Teodora's greatest wish is to establish a wholesale distributor through which she can sell even more products. Juana requires a loan that will permit her to attain her goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

S.

She is married and has five adult children.\n\nMasi owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\n\nIn 2005, Masi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\n\nMasi is now requesting a new loan of 2,000 WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve her business. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\n\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":210855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

F. (0) is a 30-year-old woman living in the town of Saanapu Uta.  She is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Sinuutupu owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Sinuutupu has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Sinuutupu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sinuutupu has successfully repaid a previous loan of no WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Sinuutupu is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Sinuutupu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

M. (0) is a 48-year-old woman living in the town of Utualii. She is married and has seven school-aged children.\n\nPepe owns and operates a business raising crops, sellings fish for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 450 WST a month.\n\nPepe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.\n\nPepe is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will again be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees.\n\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

They live in the Santa Rosa district, located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been making weavings and embroideries by hand since she was 15 years old. She now has a small workshop in her house where she makes a variety of items requested by her clients. It takes approximately a week to make a shawl because the process of weaving and embroidering is very detailed-oriented and hard work.\r\n\r\nHer husband, like most of the men in the area, works seasonally in artisanal fishing. With what they both earn they try to make things work economically for their family. Cruz continually works at making more weavings so that she can continue to sustain her family. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to work independently and to distribute her weavings in the main crafts stores in the region. This is why she is requesting her first loan, 1,800.00 PEN, from our institution.

He helps his parents earn a living for their survival.\r\n\r\nSalvador is married to Jocelyne N. and they are blessed with two children who are presently studying in the secondary and elementary levels of education.

Julie and Rolando want them to finish their studies so that they will have a brighter future.\r\n\r\nDespite the hardship and difficulties that life may bring, Julie Grace and Rolando are striving hard to earn a living and to finance the schooling of their children. The common source of their income is through farming: they till their parcel of land twice a year by planting rice and some vegetables. Furthermore, Rolando works as a carpenter while Julie Grace engages in selling barbecued food in front of their house to earn additional income. As a fruit of her patience and sacrifices, she is able to gain a net income of PHP 700 per week which they utilize to satisfy their needs and to support the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nJulie Grace aims to improve her business but she hasn\u2019t enough capital. Fortunately, when one of the lending institutions offered their programs and services in their Barangay, Julie Grace decided to join purposely to borrow additional capital. She applied for PHP 5,000 to be used in the improvement of her business.

I. (0) is a 55-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai.  She is married and has 8 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Siloma owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Siloma has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Siloma joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Siloma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Siloma is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Siloma plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. (0) is a 84-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai.  She is widowed and has 10 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Tuulima owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tuulima has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Tuulima joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tuulima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Tuulima is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tuulima plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is widowed and has three adult children. To make a living, Eleni raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Eleni has been engaged in this business for more than three years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eleni joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eleni has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Eleni is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Eleni plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Faatafunaina owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members.  Faatafunaina has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 450 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Faatafunaina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faatafunaina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided.  Faatafunaina is now requesting a new loan of 1500 tala WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faatafunaina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is a 72-year-old married woman with nine adult-aged children. She lives in Siumu where she raises crops, primarily breadfruit. She derives approximately 800 tala WST a month from planting, harvesting, then selling her crops. Sipaepae has been engaged in this business for over seven years.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Sipaepae joined SPBD to gain access to its financial services. Sipaepae successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala WST from SPBD that was used to purchase harvesting equipment (this will be her sixth loan from SPBD). Sipaepae is now requesting a loan of 1000 tala WST, which she will use to buy fertilizers such as manure. Sipaepae plans to use all business profits to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's lending philosophy is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P.

She is married and has six adult children.\r\n\r\nVaeva owns and operates a service-based business, providing general services to local community members. Vaeva has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 550 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Vaeva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service.\r\n\r\nVaeva is now requesting a new loan of 2,500 WST which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. The loan will be 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

To make a living, Patilisi owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Patilisi has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 620 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Patilisi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Patilisi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Patilisi is now requesting a new loan of 2200 tala WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Patilisi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. (0) is a 48-year-old woman living in the town of Saleaumua.  She is married and has 12 school-aged children.  To make a living, Nora owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Nora has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Nora joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase young crops to raise.  Nora is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Nora plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 67 years old. Fabiana is widowed and has 5 grown-up children. To make a living, Fabiana runs a sari-sari or general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Fabiana has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fabiana joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fabiana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Fabiana is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Fabiana from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is a 47-year-old woman living in the town of Siumu. She is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Maria raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Maria has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 400 tala a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Maria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers like manure. Maria is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Maria plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

M. (0) is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Tafitoala.  She is married and has 3 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Mareta owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Mareta has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Mareta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mareta has successfully repaid a previous loan of $750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Mareta is now requesting a new loan of $1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mareta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

D. is from the village of Romarate in Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur.

To make a living, Anecita owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" or general store where she sells daily use products, such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anecita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be Anecita's fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Masaolagi has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately $700 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Masaolagi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Masaolagi has successfully repaid a previous loan of $3000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment. Masaolagi is now requesting a new loan of $3000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Masaolagi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family'sgeneral living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":382342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

G. started to expand her hog-fattening business when she joined Kiva partner ASHI in 2007. Although her business was started five years ago, business growth was difficult because her income from selling rice, along with her husband's income, was insufficient to meet the needs of their three children. At that time, her youngest child, who is now 23, had stopped schooling while her second child was in high school and the youngest was in elementary school. Two years ago, her second child also stopped schooling. Despite her children's low level of education because of poverty, a vision of giving her children a better future gave Milagros the courage to join ASHI.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter becoming a member of ASHI, Milagros was able to get a loan for use as additional business capital. She has had two previous loans and is now applying for her third. From her business profits, Milagros was able to pay back her previous loans on time and was also able to meet her family's basic needs. Her future hope is that her business will grow to the extent that she can afford to send her youngest child, currently in school, to college, and support the rest of her children in their own endeavors.

Muminiso is a 38-year-old woman. She is married and is the loving mother of five children.\r\n\r\nMuminiso is a market vendor. For the last thirteen years she has been selling cottonseed oil at the local market. In the traditional Tajik cuisine the majority of the meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil, especially our national dish, \u201cPilau\u201d, which needs a lot of cottonseed oil in order to make it delicious.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For four years Djonmahmad has dedicated himself to raising cattle to support his humble and reliant family. Currently Djonmahmad has turned to IMON International for a loan of 2500 Somoni to purchase calves to raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him but also his dearest parents.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Zukhra, a widow and mother-of-one, describes herself as a hard-working and enterprising woman. She decided to start a sewing business many years ago because she wanted her child to get a good education. She started out helping a woman who ran a tailoring shop, and after learning the trade was subsequently offered a job. Eventually she started a small shop in her home. It has gone very well since then and she has been able to grow the business, making her famous in her community and increasing customer demand. Currently Zukhra is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni ($1150 USD) which she will use to purchase new sewing machine with computer-based embroidery so she can fulfill all her customers' requests. Zukhra is very grateful for your support in helping to grow her business and move ahead. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

first and foremost to his family and his business, Khurshed works very hard at ranching. He has his own herd of cattle with which he works day after day to earn a living to support the dearest people in his life \u2013 his parents. As every business requires investment, the business at which Khurshed works needs to add some young bulls, which will be raised and sold. For this reason he turns to IMON International to obtain a loan that will allow him to acquire the cattle to help improve the standard of living of his beloved family.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

he was very young, N. Mirzoali has dedicated himself to the raising of livestock. He is a married father who needs to support his children though they no longer need his help to complete their studies. His wife also helps him with the business. Mirzoali is faced with the need is to purchase calves. In order to then commercialize the derivative products, the raised animals are sold to farmers who resupply the small farmers with calves. To acquire the animals, Mirzoali comes to IMON International to obtain the necessary credit to purchase them and in this way continue to maintain his dear home.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He is married but has no children yet. He arduously dedicates himself to the livestock business. When Abdusalim recognized the need to invest in his work, he decided to construct a place to keep his animals and for this he requires certain construction materials. He has sought the help of IMON believing that his loan request will be granted and with this he will be able to move forward in his work. With the loan Abdusalim will purchase young cattle and construction materials for improving his cattle-shed.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet and Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While Tajikistan is working to improve its agricultural productivity and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been, and will continue to be, distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients.

Notwithstanding that, Bih H. is quite ready to fight through life to the last moment with every morsel of her strength. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is why she became a GHAPE beneficiary in 2008.

Firewood is always needed in her community, so her business is sure to be successful. With the profits from this loan, she plans to pay for her children's school fees and other educational needs and pay off medical bills.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married with two grown kids \u2013 a son and a daughter. He is an entrepreneur from Ivano-Frankivsk. He is in business selling polythene film, plastic wrap and decorative film in the busy central industrial market of his home town. Petro used to run a private firm but it went bankrupt and he had to try his luck some place else. This is how he ended up as a small businessman. Petro has been in this trade for 9 years. Currently, his monthly profit amounts to 5,000 Grivnyas. \n\nPetro is seeking a loan of 10,400 Grivnyas to buy 15 assorted rolls of plastic wrap (25 meters each), 5 rolls of polythene film (100 meters each) and 15 rolls of decorative film (50 meters each).

Josefa has been selling tortillas for two years.  She previously sold fast food, but her sales were decreasing so she changed her business in order to improve her income.  She decided to sell tortillas because it is a staple for all Nicaraguans and it would help her provide for her family\u2019s basic necessities.  Her plans include helping her children with their education so that they can have a better quality of life.  Sra. Josefa wakes up in the early hours to begin grinding the corn after it has soaked overnight.  She then begins shaping the tortillas.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her loan, Sra.

V. is a 26-year-old woman living in the town of Nonoa.  She is single and does not have any chlidren.  To make a living, Apineru owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Apineru has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Apineru joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Apineru has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Apineru is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Apineru plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: <p>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. <p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. (0) is a 37 years-year-old woman living in the town of Lotofaga Alasopo.  She is married and has 1 child school-aged children.  To make a living, Eseta owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Eseta has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 440 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eseta is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Eseta is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Eseta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":382678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

To make a living, Toefuataina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Toefuataina has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 200 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Toefuataina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Toefuataina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1500 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Toefuataina is now requesting a new loan of 2000 tala WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Toefuataina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Nonoa.  She is married and has 5 adult children.  To make a living, Faamanuia owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community.  Faamanuia has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faamanuia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3200 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Faamanuia is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST, which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle for the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faamanuia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: <p>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. <p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

 F. W. (0) is a 64-year-old woman living in the town of Aleisa A.  She is married and has 10 school-aged children.  To make a living, Ana  owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Ana  has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nAna  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ana  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4650 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Ana  is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ana  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. (0) is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Solaua.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Lavalea owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Lavalea has been engaged in this business for over 4 years.\n\nLavalea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lavalea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Lavalea is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lavalea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S. (0) is a 65 years-year-old woman living in the town of Aleisa A.  She is married and has 8 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Ape owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Ape has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Ape joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ape has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Ape is now requesting a new loan of 2000 tala WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ape plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He will purchase a sack of flour, two and a half sacks of sugar and five dozen varieties of fruits. \r\n<p>\r\nBladimir came to Esperanza with the goal of improving his business through access to credit, and is now on his third loan after having successfully repaid the first two. With the added benefits coming from increased productive capacity, Bladimir hopes to be able to move out of his rented home and purchase his own home. In the long term, he dreams of one day purchasing a truck to help expand his mobile fruit juice business. He thanks you all for your support.

To make a living, Epifania owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Epifania has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 300 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Epifania joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Epifania is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Epifania is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala WST which will be used to purchase new sewing machine.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Epifania plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 30 year-old woman living in the town of Samatau 3.  She is married and has 1 school-aged child.  To make a living, Karoline owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general services to local community members.  Karoline has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 Tala WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Karoline joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Karoline is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Karoline is now requesting a new loan of 1000 Tala WST which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide services. Karoline plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and does not have any chlidren.  To make a living, Malia owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Malia has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 200 Tala WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malia is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.  Malia is now requesting a new loan of 1000 Tala WST which will be used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business.    Malia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her experience in grain storage has helped her realize that storage is a profitable area. Therefore, with the requested loan, she would like to increase her corn stock, as well as add pepper stock.

children,18 and 14 years old.  She lives in the Urrunaga section of the district of Jose Leonardo Ortiz, located five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling food at a stand in the Carolina market (a market in the area) for 20 years, where she goes every day and is there from six in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon.  Due to the length of time that she has been doing this and to her good cooking skills, she has become very well known in the area and always has faithful customers that come to eat at her establishment.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to purchase supplies to grow her business and be able to offer more variety of food to her customers.  This is the reason for her request of a loan of 1500 new soles.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to obtain a piece of land and build her own home as she currently lives in a rented house.  Additionally, she would like to assure a better future for her children by enabling them to study for a technical or professional career.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Eugenia works with us and

T. is a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Maagiagi.  She is married and has seven adult children.  Suititi owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting decorative plants for sale.  Suititi has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nSuititi joined Kiva partner SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Suititi has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Suititi is now requesting a loan of 1200 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her third loan from SPBD.  Suititi plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":382864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

A. is from the village of Becor, Tabo-o, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 31 years old. Eliza is married and has 1 school-aged child. Eliza owns a business operating a \"sari-sari\" or general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Eliza has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eliza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eliza is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Eliza from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. (0) is a 29 year-old woman living in the town of Leloto-Leauvaa.  She is married and has 1 school-aged child.  To make a living, Eve owns & operates a business raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting cocoa for sale.  Eve has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 250 tala WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eve joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eve is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by her from SPBD.  Eve plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 34 year-year-old woman who lives in the town of Leloto-Leauvaa.

The main source of income for her business comes from planting, harvesting, and selling fruits and vegetables.  Siupolu has been in this business for over four years, and she earns approximately 156 Samoan Tala WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Siupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation, and her ability to engage in business activities.  Siupolu's first loan request from SPBD is for 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Siupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Satelite has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 650 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Satelite joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Satelite has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new sewing machine.  Satelite is now requesting a new loan of 1500 tala WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Satelite plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. (0) is a 30 years-year-old woman living in the town of Ulutogia.  She is married and has 2 children school-aged children.  To make a living, Faanimo owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Faanimo has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 270 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Faanimo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faanimo is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Faanimo is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faanimo plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

H., a 35-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa, is married and has an infant-aged child.  To make a living, Kalameli sells baked goods in the local community.  Kalameli has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nKalameli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having fully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD that was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale, she is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be her fourth from SPBD, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the business.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. (0) is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa. She is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Kisa owns & operates a business venture in the food sector, running a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community. Kisa has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nKisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Kisa has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business. Kisa is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Kisa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S. (0) is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa.  She is married and has 5 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Lonise owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community.  Lonise has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 850 WST a month from these activities.\n\nLonise joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lonise has successfully repaid a previous loan of 300 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  Lonise is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lonise plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

L. (0) is a 27-year-old woman living in the town of Faleseela.  She is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Sesilia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sesilia has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 560 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Sesilia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sesilia has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Sesilia is now requesting a new loan of 1750 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Sesilia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

S., a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Tulaele, is married and has eight school-aged children.  To make a living, Naomi operates a food stall from which she sells fried foods to the local community.  She has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 650 WST a month.<p>\r\n\r\nNaomi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having fully repaid a previous loan from SPBD that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be Naomi's third loan from SPBD, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her enterprise.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T., a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Leusoalii, is married and has three adult-aged children.  To make a living, Miriama owns and operates a general store whose main source of income  comes primarily from selling a variety of products in the local community.   Engaged in this business for over five years, she earns approximately 450 WST a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Miriama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having fully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD that was used to purchase additional products to sell,  Miriama is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This loan will be her second from SPBD, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tuavao (0) is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Leusoalii.  She is married and has 2 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Lotovale owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Lotovale has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Lotovale joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lotovale has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lotovale is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lotovale plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

L., a 50-year-old woman living in the town of Tulaele, is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Leala owns and operates a service-based business, providing general services to local community members. Leala has been in this business for over five years and earns approximately 650 WST a month.\n\nLeala (0) joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having fully repaid a previous loan from SPBD that was used to purchase equipment to improve her business, Leala is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be Leala's fourth loan from SPBD. Leala plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of her family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

To make a living, Ana owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Ana has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 650 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Ana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3500 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Ana is now requesting a new loan of 2900 tala WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Ana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. (0) is a 41-year-old woman living in the town of Manono Tai.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Tauvela owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Tauvela has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 550 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Tauvela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tauvela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  Tauvela is now requesting a new loan of 1650 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tauvela plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Soloa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to pay for services to increase crop yield.\r\n\r\nSoloa is now requesting a new loan of 1,750 WST which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

F. (0) is a 55-year-old woman living in the town of Falevao.  She is married and has 7 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Seirosa owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Seirosa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Seirosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Seirosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1100 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Seirosa is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Seirosa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 520 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,700 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nEseta is now requesting a new loan of 2,050 WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve her business. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ulaula joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

M. (0) is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Manono Tai.  She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Falelua owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Falelua has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Falelua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Falelua is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Falelua is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Falelua plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

N. is a 54-year-old woman living in the town of Sinamoga.  She is married and has 5 adult-aged children.  To make a living, Anave runs a business raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Anave has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 550 tala a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Anave joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Anave has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Anave is now requesting a new loan of 1500 tala which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 3rd loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Anave plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

L. is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Faatoia.  She is married and has 7 school-aged children.  To make a living, Pelenatete runs a bakery.  She bakes and sells a variety of confectionaries such as cookies and cakes in her local community.  Pelenatete has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 450 tala a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pelenatete joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Pelenatete has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase baking equipment.  Pelenatete is now requesting a new loan of 1500 tala which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients.  The loan will be the 2nd loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Pelenatete plans to use the extra money she earns to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
