They have lived in their own home for the past 30 years.  For the past 25 years Dunia has worked in the craft business.  She makes masks out of plaster molds that she fills with sweet dough.  These are in the shape of babies known locally as \u201cTantawawas\u201d o \u201cpanes D. beb\u00e9\u201d (baby breads).  These are normally sold in the month of November during time of \u201cTodos los Santos\u201d (All Saints), when people go to cemeteries to visit the graves of their friends and family.  Dunia makes them year round since she receives orders from many places.  She really likes her job and she works together with her husband.  Sometimes her niece helps paint the masks because it is a lot of painting.  Unfortunately, due to the fragility of the masks, some of them break during the process and that is a loss in Dunia\u2019s production.  She has learned to overcome these losses with more work and desires to get ahead.  Attracted by the opportunities available with Microfinanzas Prisma, she decided to apply for a loan in order to improve her business.  With this money she will buy more supplies to make her masks, including dye and paint for the finished product.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":258411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy supplies for mask making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T18:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423643,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116912,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011833,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595427,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989674,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":168.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T19:05:13Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84643,"name":"Alpha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel is 39 years old and a father of a one-year-old daughter.

She is the mother of two children.  She lives with her mother-in-law, who has given them their own room so that they might live comfortably, and she helps her mother-in-law with her store.  Before her second child was born, she worked putting together boxes for a neighbor, while her husband worked on a farm growing fruit. Their savings permitted them to acquire a car that they now rent out to her brother-in-law for 20 Peruvian soles per day.  Meybol helps in her mother-in-law\u2019s store in the morning, and in the afternoon from 3 to 10 o\u2019clock works on commission in her sister\u2019s clothing store.  In her free time she totals up the earnings from their car. They continue to save in hopes of building their own home.  Meybol has commented that taking care of the car is a big responsibility, because there are always repairs waiting to be made, tires and other items to be changed.  Her husband is very interested in going into the wholesale trade in fruit, with the goal of buying a plot of land and building a house. With her first loan from MFP, Meybol made her payments on time, and has continued to do so to the present.  This will be her fifth loan.  With the money she has requested, she will purchase tires for the car, so that it will continue running and will generate the needed income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":258597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of tires for her car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-20T13:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meybol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":501.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423659,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116928,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011849,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595443,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989690,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210811,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640431,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":250.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080102,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":250.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-20T16:54:28Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84685,"name":"Alida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alida tiene 57 a\u00f1os D. edad, es casada hace 37 a\u00f1os, y madre D. 4 hijos, D. los cuales uno D. ellos falleci\u00f3, actualmente vive en su casa propia; pero su negocio lo realiza en otro lugar, que tambi\u00e9n es propio.

She tells us that not long ago she brought several dozen shoes that she placed on credit, and her customers were buying them for various occasions such as school functions and for the holidays.

","en":"Jurivia Esperanza S. O. is 26 years old and married.  She has two children, one who is 5 years old and in first grade and a 7 year old who is in sixth grade.  Her life partner works in construction.  Her aim is to invest more into her working capital so she can have more to offer her customers and dominate in her market.  Her wish is to earn more so she can provide for all the needs of her children, and she dreams of giving them an excellent education which will benefit them in the future.  She also dreams of obtaining their own home for her children and, at the same time, to support the household.\r\n\r\nThe acitivty that she undertakes is selling general merchandise such as clothing, shoes, cosmetics, and other items.  She sells door-to-door, and has had her business for ten years.  Helping to augment the household\u2019s income was the initial reason for her starting her enterprise, since her husband\u2019s salary was not enough to cover the family\u2019s expenses.  For this reason, she decided to start selling her own products and began by using her own capital.  Over time, her customer base grew and she set out to focus on the business since she already had many friends who she could sell to.  With her husband\u2019s support, and given that he works during the week, she goes out on the weekends and walks to her customers\u2019 houses to offer her products.  The loan request is for working capital because she needs to stock up on merchandise, particularly as the school year is ready to start and children need to buy shoes, backpacks, skirts and pants for their uniforms, among other items.  She also needs to buy cosmetic products because she needs to be able to offer a variety of products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":258616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-20T14:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jurivia Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399992,"comment":null},{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":1419.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1468.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091990,"comment":null},{"amount":40.79,"local_amount":780.44,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":807.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985374,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445989,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956630,"comment":null},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174057,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599686,"comment":null},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1100,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035580,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2276.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947989,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is the mother of one daughter who is just 5 years old. Irshad baji is a very responsible and hard-working lady. Her husband's name is M. S. and he is a mason. Irshad baji helps him to meet the financial expenses with her skill at embroidery. She prepares embroidered dresses on orders which she gets from her neighbors and earns profit from them. She uses her income to pay the kitchen expenses. Her husband is proud of her lovely and kind attitude. She successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a micro-finance institute in Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy a donkey cart for her husband because he wants to start a transport business, because there\u2019s little income in a mason's work. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader for some more women from her locality. Shamim baji and Kaniz Fatima baji each want a loan to buy a buffalo for their milk-selling business. Mussarat baji wants a loan to buy iron to re-sell. Elahi baji wants a loan to buy a donkey cart for her for transport business. Nasreen baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Naseem baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are

He has been in business since 1977. He started selling spare car parts in Matadi in Lower Congo which is about 350 km from Kinshasa. His first business was prosperous, but collapsed due to the currency devaluation that took place in 1981. He lost about $200 of his running capital. He then went to work for a company until 2005. He stopped working and relunched his own business. His business makes about $120 per week. Mbenza planned with the first loan from Hope to diversify his business by buying palm oil. He has two points of sale within his community in order to make more income.  His dream is to open a large general boutique. Mbenza is 55 years old, married and a father of four children between the ages of 3 and 34.  Of his children, one is already married, one is at secondary school, and two at primary school. Through his business, Mbenza has been able to support his family. He also likes it because it gives him the opportunity to make contacts with many different people, and once they become permanent clients he is able to offer them quality products at a better price.

Due to the lack of financial resources, they were not able to provide their children with higher levels of education and because some of her children lack the interest to study. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years, Leticia was able to maintain her village store through the help of her husband and the financial support of a microfinance institution. She hopes to engage in another type of business in the future and to be able to support her husband in his farming needs since they no longer have children to send to school. She knows that she must work hard in order to achieve her business plan someday and to avoid asking for credit from traders that offer large interests. With this, Leticia would like to borrow a loan of PHP 7,000 that she will invest for her store and farming needs.

Naki  is a mother of three children. She is fifty years old and has lost her husband some years ago.  Dora lives with her children in Koforidua, in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Koforidua is the capital of the region. It is a busy town, full of business activities. Dora says she has been the sole provider of all the family\u2019s needs. All her three children are out of school and are working. Some are professional teachers. \r\n\r\nDora trades in textiles materials. She buys tie & dye textiles from the producers in Accra and treks to other towns to sell her products. Tie & dye is a local textile that is produced by tying either the white or colored mercerized cotton with raffia and then dying by immersion or sprinkling. The raffia prevents the dye from penetrating into the areas that have been tied. Dora has been in business for eight years.

with five children, Rose B. is a fifty four year old trader. She trades in cereals, like maize, and also operates a grocery shop at Agogo, a community where the major occupation is farming. She has been trading for the past year, a business she started with a small amount of money. Since then she has been able to support her family. \r\n\r\nRose wants to use the loan to buy a larger supply of maize and grocery items like biscuits, sugar, milk etc to serve her customers throughout the season, especially in the face of increasing prices due to the current food crisis in the country.

S. is 40 years old. She is a divorced woman with four kids. Her first-born has completed senior high school and she is hoping to enter nursing school. Joyce lives with her family at Agogo, in the Ashanti region of Ghana. For the past seven years, all that Joyce has been doing to support her household is baking bread. She says that though it was difficult in the beginning, now she sees changes in her business growth. <P>\r\n\r\nJoyce bakes bread and retails it. She says, she gives best value for money by making sure that her food quality meets her customers' expectations. Her customers book their orders in advance and before they come it is ready.

sus sue\u00f1os son que sus hijos estudien una carrera profesional ya que desde muy peque\u00f1os han tenido que trabajar para salir adelante y es por eso que ellos no han recibido estudio y en sus sue\u00f1os le gustar\u00eda que sus hijos fueran unos profesionales pero debido a la situaci\u00f3n se vieron obligados a trabajar para aportar dinero para su Mama y salir adelante.\n\nLa actividad

Sandra has 3 sons, a 22 year old , a 17 year old, and a 14 year old, all of whom work on their own.  Her husband works as a merchant.  Her goal is to increase his business, which is located in his house, so that she can expand it and thus earn more money for the family.  Her desire is to obtain more clients for her business so that it grows due to demand for her products that are staple items.  Her dream is that her children are able to study to become professionals, since they have had to work from since they were very little to get ahead and contribute money for the household expenses and thus haven't been able to study.  \r\n\r\nShe works in sales generally, offering clothing, shoes, perfumes.  In addition to this business, she has a small grocery store in which she sells sweets, soup, and basic grains.  The location of the business is her house and has had it for 12 years.  Sandra started this modest business, with the support of her children and husband, in her house with few products.  She later started the other business with more merchandise, through which obtained more clients, and thus came to have the two businesses.  They have cost her a lot of money which is why she needs the loan, to be used as work capital to purchase cosmetics, clothing and school products since the beginning of school year is approaching.  She will thus be able to offer her clients a variety of school products, for which is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the organizations that concern themselves with the necessities of each client's business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva

R. is 39 years old, she is married and has two children.  Her oldest son is 14 years old and is in his sophomore year, and her 5 year old son is in kindergarten.  \r\nHer husband works by himself, and her objective is to keep the quality of the bread that she makes, and to maintain her customer's satisfaction.  \r\nMaria wants to provide the best for her children so that they can become professionals and give back to society. Maria wishes that God gives her strength and health in order to continue her hard work and be able to improve her home and living conditions and enjoy them with her family. \r\n\r\nMaria has a breadmaking business.  She makes different types of bread such as sweet bread, simple bread, and pudding (among others).  She has had her business for the past 5 years. Maria started her business after she was laid off from the company where she worked in 2001, and since her husband was the only one working she needed to start working in order to help support her family. At that moment she decided to open a bakery in her home.  Although at the beginning it was not easy, Maria has used the opportunity that her bakery is the only one in the neighborhood.  Maria needs financing in order to buy raw materials such as flour, butter, eggs, and baking pans.  She is grateful to the Leon 2000 Foundation and all other foundations that have helped her.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Samantha Cereceda, Kiva

market, ask anyone about Munavvarhon A.. Everyone knows her. She has sold leafy green vegetables for the past ten years, starting out with dill, parsley, garlic, radishes and sorrel. Her inventory additionally includes canned fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nMunavvarhon previously lived and worked in Kanibadam, but after the death of her husband she moved to Isfara. Her daughters married and she now lives with her 18-year-old grandson.  \r\n\r\nAlthough she is 53 years old, Munavvarhon herself travels to Khojand twice a week to buy greens. Her friends also supply her with vegetables from Kokand, Uzbekistan at a good price. In the spring Munavvarhon grows dill, parsley and salad greens in her own garden.  She recognizes that competition is fierce and prices have begun to rise.  She does all she can to improve her business, and offers discounts on bulk orders in order to keep customers.

sacks of corn, peanuts, or manioc. His beginning capital in 1991 was US$ 160. The business prospered until 1995 when a truck carrying his goods from the village to Kinshasa over-turned during the rain, destroying the whole truckload. <P>\r\n\r\nAs he did not have any other financial resources, his options for the future narrowed. After two years (in 1997), he re-launched his business with $100 in capital. Gradually Mr. M. has been able to stabilize his business with the profit he earns. Currently his business capital is about US$ 600. Last August he decided to join one of Hope\u2019s groups called \u201cPuissance,\u201d meaning \u201cPower\u201d in English, and through the loan, Mr. M.\u2019s business has been strengthened. <P>\r\n\r\nWith his next loan, Mr. M. plans to deliver fresh fish, soaps, sugar, cans, etc. He wants to start farming in order to produce farm products. Mr. M. is 44 years old and the father of four children, aged between 6 and 26. All of them go to school.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":259418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling

As a beginner in the field, he had to be very careful. <P>\r\n\r\nWith determination and good management, he succeeded and was gradually able to increase his working capital from his profit and buy four more radios. His business is prospering and makes a profit of about US$ 500 per month. As Nkola has a vision of opening a big wholesale shop to provide business coming from villages, he decided to join one of Hope\u2019s groups named \u201cBwanya,\u201d meaning \u201cWorthy\u201d in English, last September. He plans to diversify his business with his loans by adding foods such as fresh fish, sacks of corn and miscellaneous other items. Nkola is 56 years old. He is married and the father of eight children between the ages of 10 and 39. Two of them live at home and are in school.

P. is 32 years old. She is divorced and has one child. She is divorced because her husband used to beat her.  Her son is 14 years old, and he is now in the first year in the junior high school. \r\n\r\nShe owns and operates a grocery shop and sells items like sugar, vegetable oil, bottled water, skim powdered milk and biscuits in her neighborhood at Apatrapa, a suburb of Kumasi. She lives in a typical Ghanaian home where there are lots of occupants. Such houses are called compound houses and there is no privacy.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she wants to purchase more crates of assorted drinks, bags of sugar, cartons of vegetable oil, boxes of biscuits and more to increase her inventory. She hopes to grow her savings to support her son in school.

Termasuk salah satunya I Nyoman Suanda yang sudah menekuni usaha membuat batu bata merah yang biasanya digunakan untuk membuat bangunan. Usaha yang sudah digelutinya puluhan tahun ini memang dulu hanya dengan modal pas-pasan. Tetapi sekarang melihat permintaan akan batu bata yang meningkat karena ramainya pembangunan di daerah sekitarnya maka Nyoman Suanda berniat meningkatkan kapasitas hasil batu bata yang diproduksinya. DINARI merespon kebutuhan modal Nyoman Suanda setelah melihat permohonan yang masuk ke DINARI dimana rencananya pinjaman sebesar Rp.4.000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan dan pembayaran cicilan setiap bulan ini akan digunakan Nyoman Suanda untuk menambah modal baik untuk membeli bahan baku batu bata maupun untuk membayar karyawannya sebanyak 2 orang. Keuntungan yang diperoleh perbulannya mencapai Rp.2.000.000,- dimana harga dari batu bata per buahnya adalah Rp.400,- dan Nyoman Suanda mampu menjual batu bata sebanyak 5000 buah setiap bulannya. Dari usahanya ini, Nyoman Suanda mampu menghidupi istrinya yang hanya sebagai ibu rumah tangga serta mampu juga menyekolahkan ketiga anaknya di bangku SD.\n\n\n","en":"An economic condition that corners people to the toughest direction forces people to work even harder. I Nyoman Suanda, who produces red bricks for construction, is one of them. He started his business tens of years ago with limited capital. Now because of the increase of demand from the growth of the surrounding areas, Nyoman wants to increase his red brick production capacity. DINARI responded to Nyoman Suanda\u2019s capital need after reviewing the proposal. The proposal stated that the 4,000,000 IDR loan, paid in 12 monthly payments, will be used to purchase raw materials and to pay his two employees. His sales in each month is 2,000,000 IDR in which he can sell 5,000 bricks at the price of  400 IDR each. From this business Nyoman Suanda can support his wife and send his three children to elementary school. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Arliadi (Ludi) Mahadi, Kiva
