The success of this investment stems from the fact that she gets discounts for buying in volume.

","en":"Kulsara is 55 years old. She has brought up four children. In the search of an income source for her family, in 1993 Kulstara started a farming and livestock business. Her business, launched with 10,000 KGS of starting capital, now brings in about 8,000 KGS monthly from the sales of milk and dairy products. Thanks to Kulsara's hard work, her livestock now includes two dairy cows, one calf and 35 sheep. In addition, Kulsara works 1.6 ha [about 4 acres] of land, where she grows kidney beans.

The impact that it had on her business was that the volume of her sales increased since she had a lot of variety of food for her customers so she could satisfy their daily demand and generate good income to have a better quality of life for herself and her family.  Her plans for the future are to buy more equipment so she can expand to other locations at different points in the city and also to finish her secondary education.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras  -  Marzo del 2012  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1031124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, bread, cheese, oil, etc., for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":857.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T11:21:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404060,"name":"Rahimkul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430  \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u0412\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u0441 \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u043a \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u044b\u0442\u044b\u043c\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430.  \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b  \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c \u0436\u043c\u044b\u0445\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442.\u0427\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0410\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0434, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d.

To provide a source of income for her family, Jumabubu became involved in animal husbandry in 1997.  The business, started with 10,000 som (KGS), today yields about 12,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and meat products.  Thanks to Jumabubu's hard work, her livestock headcount includes five dairy cows and thirty-five sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Jumabubu requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings into a further increase of livestock headcount in order to open her own mini-farm in the future.

Nadezhda has been involved in this entrepreneurship for 12 years.  She currently has merchandise valued at 10,000 hryvnia.  Currently, Nadezhda's business is not very developed, but despite that, it provides a stable income for her and her family.  Nadezhda hopes to use the loan to expand the inventory of spring merchandise selection.  A more varied choice of merchandise attracts customers, and Nadezhda would be able to earn more due to a quicker goods turnover.  Small things and inexpensive goods that Nadezhda sells sell well and are in high demand."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1043646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to expand the inventory of spring merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Drogobych","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49.35 23.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadezhda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T08:16:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404210,"name":"Muharam","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0415\u0451 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u043a\u043e \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f. \u0421 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044c\u044e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 2000 \u0421\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.","en":"For more then 6 years Muharam has been selling shoes and children's clothes on the local market.

This has opened to her a new market based on the customers that purchase cheese from her, which she brings from the region of Magdalena. Her dream is to acquire her own dwelling and she works every day to achieve this. \r\n\r\nHer business and potential for customers have grown so Emperatriz is requesting this loan, her first with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She is responsible for a small young kid who completely depends on her care. Soeurn is involved in agribusiness during the rainy season but she also acts as a chef serving foods for a large group of people, particularly the ones who come for special ceremonies like wedding parties, birthday parties as well as funeral ceremonies. She has her own team to provide this type of service around the province or distant areas outside the province.  Another main source of income is from her husband who works at the construction field. He\u2019s a construction foreman who leads a small group of men to perform particular jobs.\r\n\r\nPresently, her family is experiencing difficulties in daily activities and businesses due to the lack of a proper vehicle for traveling.

With little knowledge but with the support of more experienced friends, he organized his workshop bit by bit, acquiring experience and an ability to take risks, and it has paid off: he found clients in other cities, such as Cartagena, where he did very good work for four years and polished his technical skills.  Returning to Barranquilla, with much more experience and a high chance of getting clients, he decided to set up business, in a strategic point in the family home.  Today, he maintains electrical appliances and buys and sells them.  His store is in his mother-in-law's house, where he lives with his family, and he generates additional income by selling cheese, purchased with the working capital produced by his business.  He is very proud of all this, as it has made it possible for him to acquire much of what he needs to look after his own and his family's welfare.\r\n\r\nHe is currently applying to Kiva for the second loan he has received from microfinance partner the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  He will use the money to buy a batch of televisions that have been offered to him at a good price so he can repair and resell them.  This will generate a much higher profit margin, so this investment has to succeed.  With his first loan from the Foundation, he bought tools, such as a Fluker tester, which is indispensable for the service he provides, since it is very precise.  His future goal is to buy an oscilloscope, a soldering station, enhanced lighting, and a shop window, to take advantage of the fact that in the place where he is located, there are no other repair shops.  But his biggest challenge is that before he can realize these future plans, he needs to get together enough working capital as quickly as possible.  Still, he knows that little by little, he can achieve his dreams and finally have his own house for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1032899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a batch of televisions to repair and resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-22T23:15:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402523,"name":"Martha Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha de 44 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer casada que tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 5 a12 a\u00f1os.

She worked there for over two years and got to know everything there is to know about the business. She then underwent an intense training period and in September 2011, she was given her own shop to run in Kafue. \r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning. She has grown into a full-blown business woman who goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy. Her customers benefit from her business because there is no need to open an account. She is also located right in the heart of Kafue so customers do not have to go far to do their money transfers. \r\n\r\nHer biggest business concern is that she is not able to give her customers the fastest possible service because she has problems accessing the internet due to the poor signal at her shop. She also worries about sometimes having to  ask her customers to wait, as she rushes to the bank and back, to get money to serve them. \r\n \r\nTamara is sure that a loan from Kiva will change her business because it will give her the money she needs to buy a computer and increase her working capital.\r\n\r\nHer hope is for her business to start making more profit by the time she has her baby. \r\n\r\nIn her video, Tamara is being interviewed by a representative from Mobile Transactions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1045296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To increase her working capital and buy a small computer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kafue","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":4950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"loan_amount":4950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-19T18:05:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402064,"name":"Mutale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mutale is 21 years old and the firstborn in a family of five.

Rafael tambi\u00e9n tiene 14 a\u00f1os de trabajar como vigilante de un edificio y maneja su propia clientela. Siempre apoyado por su esposa, ha logrado sacar adelante a sus hijos. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, sexto cr\u00e9dito que recibe de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n a la que est\u00e1 vinculado, hace 8 a\u00f1os y de su mano ha logrado hacer crecer su negocio y mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales. Con su credikiva planea continuar mejorando su vivienda y levantar paredes, pues tiene problemas de humedad que afectan a su vecino, as\u00ed mismo terminar\u00e1 de construir una de sus habitaciones en la parte trasera de la vivienda,  para lograr el acomodamiento de toda su familia en su hogar y mayor sosiego. ","en":"52 year old Rafael is married and has 2 children who are 16 and 32 years old. He works selling goods that he promotes through special catalogs. He began doing this 11 years ago when he was working as a guard. He decided to combine his job with other work that would also generate income in order to support his family. In this way, along with his wife, he spent 5 years making chichi (a sort of fermented drink), and reached daily sales of 300 bags which they delivered to stores and people in the neighborhood. But, because of transport complications for their product, which they had to move from the city of Barranquilla to the La Playa urban area, they didn't continue and decided to focus on having their own home.  So, they got some land where, little by little, they built the house that the own today. At first they built it of wood, but, little by little, they were able to build parts from cement and they left a space empty with the idea of having a store there.  They sold family groceries there for 3 years but the proliferation of these sorts of businesses in the neighborhood obliged them to change their store to an ice cream place, which they then ran for 3 more years. However, the continuous theft of electrical wiring almost left them broke and they had to lease the store space so that they could have a more secure income. Then Rafael and his wife decided to sell general supplies and to link themselves to companies that use catalogs to promote their products. \r\nRafael also has 14 years of work experience as a guard and has his own clients. Always supported by his wife, he has been able to bring up his children. At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan and this will be the 6th loan he has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization he has been associated with for 8 years and which has helped him to grow his business and improve his living conditions. With his Kiva loan, he plans to continue improving his home and building walls. He has damp problems that are affecting his neighbor and also will finish building one of the rooms in the back part of the house so that there is space for all the family and greater peace. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1033183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to build walls as he has a problem with damp, and to build a room in the back part of his house.

He used to work for a company that produced and sold shoes, but he retired from this position in 1985 so that he could start up his own venture.  He bought shoe lasts (molds) and a motor, with which he began making sandals that he would sell to his relatives and friends. Very soon people began to take note of the quality of his products.  He would display each design in his own home, and he started to sell by the dozens to customers who had their own clientele, and so in this way he has continued to work.  His dream is to have more growth in his workshop, so that he could hire workers and generate jobs.  In addition, he would like to have his own place where he could exclusively display his shoes.  However, his main challenge is that he lacks the working capital he needs to achieve his dreams and be able to respond to his rapidly growing customer base.  At this time, he is applying for a Kiva loan, and this will be the first time that he has had financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, he will buy glue, leather, heels, platforms and plastic, and he will also make some repairs to his shoe stitching machine.

She has been working with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 12 years, since she started out in the group solidarity programs, where she received two loans to strengthen her business of frozen foods and merchandise sales, especially shoes. She got the idea for her business from her mother-in-law when they moved to the city and she decided to sell rice pasteles [similar to a tamale]. When her mother-in-law left the business, Sandra took advantage of the situation and took on her mother-in-law\u2019s customers. She continued that business and also added the frozen foods, which she still sells. For a while she was fighting an illness, but she has recuperated with time and now she is requesting a new loan strengthen her frozen foods business because she has a lot of orders but not enough working capital to respond to her customers. She also generates income through the sale of merchandise; she has orders for shoes and she needs to respond to new orders so she can capitalize more on her business. This is why she is requesting her first loan with Kiva. She will use it to buy raw materials and ingredients for preparing foods, and shoes, which she sells through specialized catalogs.

She is a entrepreneur at the market, where she sells a most diverse assortment of goods:  children's jackets, windbreakers, men's and women's hats, as well as backpacks and camping gear.  Natalya has already been selling hats for quite some time; she started 15 years ago.  However, by training, Natalya is a guide.  Four times a year, she leads various groups on hiking trips.  When the time came, her skills and the experience she earned as a guide helped her to open a sales outlet for camping gear, which she added to her assortment of clothes and hats.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Natalya has 40,000 hryven invested in inventory.
