She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and do maintenance on her vans. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNerissa hopes to have her own house someday and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In addition, he cannot compete with the large bakeries who come in vehicles to deliver their bread to the same stores that he delivers to.

Lidia frequently works with the support of her husband and some laborers whose help she needs during harvest seasons and when she needs maintenance work carried out on her plot of farmland.  Lidia is happy with the work that she does because it makes her good income.  She would like to open a grocery store but she faces a problem in that her house is still not suitable for setting up a store.  First she will have to finish some building work.\r\n\r\nThis is Lidia's first loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time.  She will use her 1,000 soles to maintain her coffee crops.

Her more than 20 years in agriculture have taught her the essentials about farming in an environment of unfavorable climate and seasons with low rainfall. For that reason she now grows potatoes, peas and gladioli, because these three products give her the most satisfaction. \"Gladioli are very profitable. They can be harvested twice a year and be planted any month,\" she says. Rosalbina does not care to transport the flowers to the city of Tarma, because they are in high demand there and the merchants are ready to travel to her village and negotiate a substantial price. Now she will plant gladioli and expects them to be ready in May, because May is one of the months with the highest flower prices.\r\n\r\nThis loan would be her thirteenth with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. She gives her word to be punctual with paying the installments. She is grateful and happy with her communal bank \"La Libertad de Huaripampa\" (the freedom of Huaripampa) because of the teamwork.

is 32 years old.

She lives in what was formerly her parents\u2019 house. It has been some months since her mother died and her father never lived with her as he abandoned them when she was young, and because of this, since she was young, she has known what it is to make sacrifices, even that of carrying a pain so great as when we lose our mother, to whom she is very grateful because she always supported her and gave her love. Despite what happened she continues fighting as she has her little one that is the greatest gift that God has given her, Isabel says, and despite everything that might happen by looking at her daughter she is able to get up and keep going.\r\n\r\nIsabel previously worked in the fields, saving little by little and she decided to open a business selling sweet potatoes, and she has been working at this for one year. With work and effort she was able to rent a small place where now she sells bags of sweet potatoes, selling up to 25 bags of sweet potatoes weekly, selling more Monday and Fridays. She thinks that she is doing well in her business because she serves her clients well, but what is more important she thanks God who guides her steps, especially because she has to do things well so that her daughter will be proud of her.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very grateful for the Kiva loans and thanks to the help that has been given she could buy merchandise (sweet potatoes) in the field as they cost less, which allows her a greater variety of products and to be able to add to her income, to continue fighting and be able to fulfill her big dream of \u201cproviding a profession for her daughter and having her own facility for her business.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1005626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":70.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75.26},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":93.8},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":96.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.23},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T22:43:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391948,"name":"Benjamin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Benjamin tiene 30a\u00f1os y vive en la ciudad de imperial, ciudad que se caracteriza por la importante actividad comercial de sus habitantes.

She is a very hard-working woman who lives in the city of Pisco, Peru. Pisco is only 28 meters above sea level. It is an important tourist destination for well-off Peruvians, because of its vineyards, its production of pisco (Peru's national drink), and its proximity to Inca ruins and to the Paracas National Reserve, one of the most famous national parks in Peru. \r\n\r\nHowever, the city was very close to the epicenter of the devastating 8.0 magnitude earthquake that shook south central Peru in August 2007. More than 80% of the city was destroyed, and after several years, the city and its people are still recovering from the damage.\r\n\r\nIn her free time she enjoys reading books, as they help her forget whatever is worrying her, or if she is in a bad mood. As is well known, Peru has some of the most delicious food in the world, and one of the dishes that Carmen really likes is the very tasty \"Caucau\" (a stew made with tripe and potatoes). \r\n\r\nCarmen went to school as far as fifth year of secondary, but she would have liked to have studied Administration. Carmen is a single mother. Her son is 15, and in fifth year of secondary school.  \r\n\r\nCarmen works in her business selling handicrafts.

Kamenka-Dneprovskaya with his wife and young daughter.  He grows vegetables on his own piece of land.  He has two large hothouses and two separate ones for seedlings.   He has been farming for 4 years already, and before this, his parents also farmed.  At the present time Alexei has invested 60,000 hryven in his farm.  His yearly expenses for seed and greenhouse film come to 14,000 hryven.\r\n\r\nAlexei needs a loan through Kiva in order to buy 5,000 hryven worth of coal to keep his hothouses warm, and 5,000 hryven worth of seed for planting.  Alexei wants to invest the extra profit in further expanding his farm.  He is planning to build another hothouse and install new heating systems in all his hothouses.

She is an elementary school teacher and works at a kindergarten near her home. \r\n\r\nAdriana has also managed to generate income to sustain her family with her small business preparing food. In the afternoon hours she sells potatoes filled with meat, cheese, and chicken, which are combined into \"little fingers\" or stuffed pasties, and other wheat flour products. She is assisted by her sister and father, and they sell from the patio of her home, which is located south of the city. \r\n\r\nDuring weekends and holidays she has recently added new offerings like charcoal grilled chicken and roast beef. Her business - and her client base - has grown every time, and as a result her capital turn around can't meet the demand. \r\n\r\nAdriana's goal is to have a storefront somewhere other than her home in order to have more peace for her family, and not increase her working day. Currently she is requesting a Kiva loan, initial financing done by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy raw materials and goods in large volumes, a grill larger than the one she uses, and a heated display case. This infrastructure will allow her to serve more customers than she is able to now, and she will also get discounts for buying larger quantities - all of which supports the success of her investment.

He grows early vegetables in greenhouses.  On 0.8 ha, he built several greenhouses where he grows 6,000 bushes of early tomatoes, 1,000 cucumber plants, 0.4 tons of potatoes, and 6,000 head of cabbage.  Alexander isn't new to this business.  His 18 years of experience show.  Alexander has learned a lot in his years of farming, and he has gained the expertise that is important to an agriculturalist.

Luaupu needs a loan of WST $2,500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make baked goods for sale. She plans to use the profit from her sales (estimated to be 400 Talas per week) to continue to improve the business.\n\nIn 2007, Luaupu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.

Her business is selling new clothing and catalog lingerie.  She has been in this business for two years.  She makes her sales to workers in a hospital and from her home to neighbors and acquaintances.  She says that she also works as a domestic employee some days of the week.  She buys the clothing in Patronato and Meiggs neighborhoods, in the city of Santiago and buys the lingerie directly from the brand's distributor.\r\n\r\nElodia will use her loan to buy catalog lingerie.  She says that she will only invest in this merchandise because, owing to the change in the season, it is more risky to buy clothing because you can end up left with merchandise which you are unable to sell.\r\n\r\nElodia says that during the winter season she buys cardigans, leggings and fleece clothing (a warm material).  One of her goals is to have established sales premises.  For this, she will need to extend her house and she will do it.  Elodia lives together with her husband and one of her personal dreams is to go on vacation and travel around another area of the country.  She says that the only thing stopping her is her work schedule.\r\n\r\nElodia is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that she is receiving from Fondo Esperanza as it allows her to invest in her business.  She says that her community bank is very good and united.  She is so keen that she has been holding the meetings in her own home for the past six months.  As regards the training sessions, she has learned new strategies for organizing her business.\r\n\r\nTalca is located in Maule region, in the central area of our country.  It is the region's administrative, financial and cultural center, being one of the most important cities in Chile's Central Valley.  There is an interesting reference to Talca in the Chilean phrase: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (Talca, Paris and London).  One of the suggestions as to its origins is that it comes from something an Englishman once said: \"Talca parece Londres' (Talca is like London), owing to the abundant fog which frequently covers the city during the winter, just as it does in the UK capital."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":124.69,"image":{"id":1006480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy catalog lingerie","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-02-20T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-21T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":381143,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":30451},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28953},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29506},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":30069},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30643},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31228},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31824},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32431},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":33050},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33681},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":34324},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":34983}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":124.69,"local_amount":59404,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":59799.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315317,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-21T11:44:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392950,"name":"Malak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malak is a 19-year-old Lebanese married woman.
