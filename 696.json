is Leticia, 53, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines, a widow and mother to her four children.  She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n                            \r\nLeticia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also retails electronic cell phone loads for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeticia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

A customer\u2019s order is bought in with cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 27,000. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nUrsula hopes to be successful in her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":899114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for merchandise items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":27000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":9003.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571886,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7202.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529441,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":7202.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738657,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3601.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-25T13:54:59Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":348728,"name":"Annalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annalyn is 32 years old.

is Nelia, 61, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNelia maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer\u2019s order is bought in with cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1500 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNelia hopes to be successful in her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":899122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for merchandise items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4321.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571887,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3457.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529442,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3457.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738658,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1728.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145886,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-25T06:40:40Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":348732,"name":"Dufatanemunda I Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Paul est un commer\u00e7ant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 30ans qui habite  le quartier Nyamugari de la ville de Gitega au centre du pays.

The first activity generates more income and although she started it after she became a manicurist she took advantage of the opportunity to build her clientele for meat products and assorted merchandise.  When she began with her entrepreneurial idea, she took courses ten years ago to become a manicurist.  She gained experience working as an employee in a beauty salon for two years and then became independent earning profits that she invested in merchandise which led to her going into the cold cuts business once she had an established clientele of her own.\r\n\r\nYady covers family expenses with her businesses.  Her family consists of her spouse and three children whose ages range from 5 to 11 years.  She provides the manicure services primarily in customers\u2019 homes.  Her monthly sales produce a good profit margin which allows her to contribute to household expenses and convert her personal needs.  She does not own fixed assets; all of her assets are fluid.  Her profit margin is appropriate for this type of business.\r\n\r\nShe is currently getting ready for the end of year festivities and needs to buy cold cuts she has pending orders for as well as assorted merchandise like underwear, women\u2019s wear and supplies she needs for her work as a manicurist.

He began his business because he did not have the opportunity for someone to support him through school and needed a source of income to provide a livelihood for his family. When he dropped out of school, he joined his elder brother in business until he had his own small business that he was peddling.  From there he now can boast of this shop.  \r\n\r\nCompetition is high but he normally beats his competitors by offering the latest designs. This meets the demands of the customers. He serves customers around town and the outskirts of the city. His business is popular because of the latest fashions and the good quality and prices of his goods. He is assisted by his wife, and he usually travels to Guinea two times in the month by public transportation to buy his business stocks.\r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business.  \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Bai requires a loan in order to purchase 60 pairs of ladies' jeans @ 35,000 SLL and six pairs of Timberland boots @ 150,000 SLL. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Bai plans to build a house and open another outlet for his business.

In addition, she wanted a business that would allow her to be independent and earn her own money but at the same time to take care of her children.  And so her husband helped her to open a small grocery, which Rosalba has now had for 4 years.  Her younger children help her in the store after school, which allows her to go out to purchase merchandise to stock her store.  In addition to running the store, Rosalba sells clothing, shoes and cosmetics from a street stand as well as in her store.  Little by little she has been growing her business and contributing financially to their household.  Rosalba needs the loan to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics, basic grain inventory, canned goods, candies, milk, juice, soda and cleaning agents.  The loan will help her to stock up her grocery and to purchase general merchandise to sell.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \"Jireh\", and is made up of 20 entrepreneurs, who work in different trades, among which are found: clothing sales, lease of inflatable toys for children, construction teachers, center of depilation, artesans, lease of banquet articles, and service of floral arrangements, among others.

She works in commerce, specifically selling used children's clothing.  Her sales are made from home during the week at any time of day, and on the weekends, she sets up a stall in an open market with her wares. She purchases her merchandise from distributors located in the city of Santiago.  She purchases the clothes by the bale which contain around 250 articles of clothing.  With the loan, she will buy bales of clothes and bags of used toys, since the Christmas season is approaching and it is a good season to sell these types of products.  Her goals are to expand her business and to include a greater variety of products.  Moreover, she would like to have a place established in some open market, that would offer her flexibility with her schedule and a certain amount of independence.  \r\n\r\nDomenica lives with her husband and their two children, ages 6 and 4.  She receives the support of her husband when he works, since he is primarily responsible for caring for the children.  Her husband is also a merchant and one of their dreams as a family is to become independent, to obtain better profits with their respective business.  Domenica is very happy for the loan and the services offered by Fondo Esperanza (Hope Fund), since the loan has allowed her to invest in her business and the trainings have served to help her learn about accounting, administration and strategies for how to manage her business.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the group of the communal bank, she comments that they have had some differences to face; nevertheless, they have solved all without any problem, and that is what has brought the group together.  \r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the region of Maule, located in the central part of the country.  It constitutes the cultural, economic, and administrative center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley.  In Chile, a curious reference about Talca exists; the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London\".  Among the myths on the matter, some they say that this is a derivation of the originally saying by an Englishman \"Talca seems like London\", due to the abundant fog that covers often the city in the winter season, resembling the capital of the United Kingdom.
