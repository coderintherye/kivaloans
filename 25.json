She is a married woman, living with her husband and two children. In addition, she is also raising another child who is her husband's from a previous marriage. <P>Agnes was born in 1975 in a village called Lace-kocot in Pader district, Northern Uganda. She was not able to get much education because of lack of finances, and she married much earlier than she would have wished. But she is a hard worker and has learned a great deal from Life in Africa and their many craft projects. She has also grown in self-esteem through her contact with the LiA group.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<P>At one time, Agnes ran a small kiosk selling foodstuffs, but she and her husband sold this business to buy a motorcycle. Her husband earns income providing transport in the area. To suplement their income, Agnes sells charcoal and also sells crafts to LiA. However, she knows that the small income she earns, about 80,000 Uganda shillings per month, is not enough to fully support the family.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAgnes' plan is to open a restaraunt. She has selected a good location in Kanyagoga, near the army and the hospital. This will give her a good customer base since the army, hospital staff, patients, and families of patients are in need of cooked food. She will serve a variety of local dishes and she is confident that she will be able to make a profit of at least 100,000 Uganda shillings per month which will greatly improve the living standard for the family.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo start this business, Agnes is seeking a loan in the amount of 250,000 Uganda shillings (US$ 150), which she will use to purchase the utensils and equipment needed. She plans to employ two waitresses which will also leave her free to continue with her other income-generating activities.

He attended Gulu central high school for his A-levels and is currently single.<br><br>\r\nMorris started working at World Food Programme for 6 months, then he was with Caritas Gulu for a further 6 months. When his contract ended, he came back with the money raised and established a small barber shop together with a water tap. In this way, he has earned a living to supplement occasional short-term contracts with humanitarian organizations in Gulu. Throughout this time he also volunteered in the evenings, taking care of night commuter children at Chatrity for Peace Foundation. In August 2006, he joined Life in Africa where he is currently working.as a gallery salesman and store manager.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBecause of the unreliable power in the district, Moris intends to get a loan of 250,000 Uganda shillings (US$ 150) to stablise power to run his machines.

At the beginning, she only had a small amount of inventory, but with time she accumulated enough inventory that now she has a designated area in her home where she keeps all of her plastic products.<p>\r\nIn order to increase sales and to better serve her clients, she would like to increase her inventory by offering a different variety of plastic products. In order to do so, Reyna is requesting a loan in the amount of $650 USD.  She will repay the loan within 6-12 months.  You can help improve the living conditions of her family.

Irina can hardly handle the high demand she\u2019s facing now.  \r\n\r\nIrina realizes that lending services are very helpful to her business. Loans allow her to increase her turnover capital and expand her business. She would like to help more people make their homes comfortable and cozy , so she is requesting a loan for $500 to hire two more work crews who would help install vinyl windows and blinds. She believes this will not only help her business grow, but will also provide jobs for many unemployed people in her little town. Irina is hoping to use generated profit to buy a more spacious house for her family and improve their living standards."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":43342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase new tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Izyum","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49.212778 37.256944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2007-06-20T07:12:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-04T18:53:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2007-07-23T09:16:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34588,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2007-08-23T09:16:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2007-09-23T09:17:01Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":57697,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T09:16:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70917,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T10:18:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85461,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":101460,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-06-20T18:53:58Z","paid_date":"2007-12-23T10:16:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":12247,"name":"Salomat","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Salomat M. is married and has 5 children.

G.

Her main source of income is the preparation and sale of \"bouillie\"-corn mush. She is well known by everyone in her neighborhood of Aklakou. Ms. ZOGBONTO G. has already benefitted from a credit of $250.00, that she used to re-launch her economic activity after the death of her husband. This activity allows her to feed her children and to pay for their schooling, however, the number of children creates large expenses. And so, she hopes to improve her business and is asking for a loan of $600.00 to purchase and to stock corn and wood in order to meet her customer's demands. The additional earnings she will make from selling \"bouillie\" will be used to care for the nutritional, sanitary and schooling needs of her children and will improve their social standing. <p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nMadame G.

in Aklakou in 1968, Mr. F. Teko is married and the father of five children. His wife has a small-business where she sells foodstuffs to local school establishments. This activity means that his wife is not able to help with the housework.  A professional driver, Mr. F. takes his passengers from Aklakou, his town, to Lome, the capital city, in his taxi whose motor has fallen into disrepair. Educated all the way to Secondary School, Mr. Teko has 15 years experience in his profession. In order for him to re-launch his business, he needs a good quality car. This is why he is asking for a loan of $1,200.00, to purchase a new motor and to replace certain parts. With these repairs, he and his family can re-find the joy of life and to meet their nutritional, schooling and sanitary needs. <p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 \u00e0 Aklakou en 1968, Monsieur F.

That will allow her to buy supplies and produce oil in greater quantities to keep up with demand. She will then be able to improve living conditions for her family. <P> <B>Translated from the French by Teresa Kramer, KIVA volunteer <P><\/B>Madame Ayaba K. est n\u00e9e \u00e0 Mawussi en 1969. Aujourd\u2019hui mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de sept enfants, la production de l\u2019huile de palme est sa principale source de revenu.

Cette activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de sa m\u00e8re fait d\u2019elle une grande femme. Il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es que Madame Ayaba pr\u00e9pare et vend de l\u2019huile de palme. Cette exp\u00e9rience lui conf\u00e8re un savoir-faire. La qualit\u00e9 de son huile est bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par les consommateurs qui expriment toujours la demande. <P>Aujourd\u2019hui, elle souhaite augmenter son fonds de commerce et c\u2019est pourquoi elle sollicite ce cr\u00e9dit de $750 qui lui permettra de s\u2019approvisionner en noix de palme afin de produire son huile en grande quantit\u00e9 pour couvrir la demande.

In fact, he is responsible for his dead brothers\u2019 seven children, his grandmother, and his own aging mother.  His meager income barely meets his family\u2019s needs. Having gained 10 years\u2019 worth of experience as a shop assistant selling cement, Mr. A. has now opened his own shop, which he intends to supply wholesale by purchasing cement directly from the factory at a reduced price.  Mr. A. is desperately short of the funds required to make these purchases.  He is a creditworthy customer who has honored his previous loans, and he is now requesting a $1200 loan which would allow him to keep his shop constantly stocked up, and to satisfy the high demands of the current market. The resulting income will help cover his family\u2019s expenses, and gradually build up a contingency fund that will keep his business going.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1968 \u00e0 Attitogon, Monsieur A.

months ago Victor took out his first loan with Kiva and Mifex. He wisely invested the money in goods that would make perfect gifts during the busy Christmas season, specifically focusing on cell phone products and accessories. He made a significant amount of profit after making his investment. With the money he made, he decided to pursue a new business venture.\r\n<p>Victor has set up an ice cream shop in the home of his parents. He also travels around the neighborhood and the main streets of Guayaquil selling his products. He has seen a huge change since receiving his first loan. He now has a business of his own in his parents' house, and he feels much more optimistic about the future.

For the past few years she had been able to sustain the family employing her husband to attend to the clients who frequent their cafeteria\/night club. The husband does the hard labor, while Maria is the administrator. \r\n<p>\r\nTheir business is located in a community that was built by a foreign government grant wherein their homes are built of thin sheets of cement, sprayed on metallic sightings, with wooden structure roofs topped by asphalt shingles.  The community consists of about 500 living units where approximately 3000 people live. Thus, Maria\u2019s business together with a few other similar micro-businesses serve the night time recreational needs of the community. As you might expect, the cafeteria has very old and decrepit boom box for sound equipment. They can only function when there is electricity, which is approximately half of the time.
