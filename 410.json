She used the money to install a new beauty station and buy another hairdryer chair.\n\nWhen borrowers pay down 40% of their loans with ACCION USA, they are eligible to refinance for more funds. In April, when Elizabeth had paid down about 60% of her loan, she came to us to refinance in order to make further improvements to her salon. \n\nWith her loan, Elizabeth will refurbish the tile flooring in her salon and to buy additional dryers. Elizabeth will be able to continue strengthening her credit and making her salon more welcoming and professional-looking to customers. Ultimately, she hopes this renovation of her business space leads to a more profitable business to support her and her husband and children.\n\n\n About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\n\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6120.33,"image":{"id":547651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":547645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

tailor and single but raising three children whose age varies from 8 to 5 years. He has been a tailor for 15 years and excels in sewing women's clothing and doing embroidery, which brings in a good deal of income since women are among his best customers. \r\n\r\nAs soon as he receives his loan, he intends to buy lengths of African print cloth wholesale, other cloth by the meter, and sewing notions such as bolts of lining material, packs of zippers, lace, etc., to use to make dresses and shirts ready-to-wear, to display for sale instead of waiting for orders from customers. \r\n \r\nAmong his plans for the future, he intends to open a big workshop of cutting, sewing, and training and right now he already has three seamstresses who are in training with him. \r\n\r\nHe says that being able to put aside more in savings will allow him to grow his business. He does get a lot of orders but he works hard at getting them ready on time so as not to discourage the customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is married and is raising three children. They live together in the community of  Sirenachayocc, located in the beautiful jungle of Cuzco, where they have their own house made of adobe.  For Julia, the lessons and learning her family left her have been very important, and for this she owes them a lot. Today she has a grocery store, selling from her house. Most of her neighbors go to her establishment. Nonetheless her family went throuh some crises, when at first selling food that she offered before didn't work out.  With time and with the support of her husband, they took the risk of setting up the store and it wasn't a mistake- now they make good earnings.  In the future, they want to get into agriculture, growing coffee and cacao, in order to have extra income and set aside something for any problem that comes their way.  She generally does the work herself, but on ocassions receives help from her children.  Her plans for the future are to expand her business to other strategically located locales in order to attract new customers.

This group has 12 members and this is the second time that it requests a loan through CrediComun. Group member Angelica B. is 35, and her lack of a formal education doesn't stop her from being hard working and ambitious. She is a homemaker with 2 children, one girl and one boy, ages 18 and 16 respectively. She makes a living raising sheep, which she began 2 years ago with 2 ewes. She was able to breed the ewes, sell the offspring, and so buy more ewes. This is how she has grown her business. She is requesting the loan to buy fodder and feed for her ewes as well as to purchase some lambs to fatten and sell. With the profits she hopes to save up some money to buy a calf. By raising and keeping it to produce milk and cheese for sale, she hopes to increase her earnings and quality of life. She also hopes to gradually acquire the home appliances she needs.

She needed work that would allow her to be at home enough to take care of her young children, and she found it in cosmetic sales. Since then she gets up very early every morning to start household chores and spends the rest of the day selling merchandise. Her main customers are her friends and neighbors who come to her for the latest attractive offerings from the cosmetics line.

Her dream is to stay in good health so that she can keep working. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":549922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of chickens, pigs, and food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Gerardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892554,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632900,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846934,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113395,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406988,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406989,"comment":null},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T09:28:23Z","paid_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205671,"name":"Namm's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eight members make up this village bank loA., located in Prek They village in Kandal province.

They have two children who are 26 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nErna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and to improve their living conditions.

They have three children who are between 12 and 15 years old. The children are currently going to school and help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nJulia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by the production of their rooster boxes and engaging in a rice retailing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJulia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 was used to fund operations of her rooster box making and rice retailing businesses, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 15th loan in the amount of PHP 29,500, which she intends to use on the production of her rooster boxes and rice retailing business. Julia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 49 years old. Arcelie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Arcelie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Arcelie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Arcelie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Arcelie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arcelie is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Arcelie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

S. is a 48-year-old married woman who lives in Guartel Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling fish.\n\nAylin\u2019s husband, Marvin, is also a fish vendor and they have three children who are between 15 and 26 years old. They have one child who is currently going to school and who also helps in the business as part of the daily chores. Their other two children are currently working for other people.\n\nAylin S. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 1995 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000 from her business activities.\n\nAylin S. is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 was used to purchase a motorcycle so that they could reach more rural areas in their fish vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and on her family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 24,000 for her 14th loan which she intends to use as additional working capital in her fish-vending business. Aylin is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":549033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To use as

Y actualmente se encuentra solicitando un nuevo cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles para invertirlos en la compra de insumos con los cuales preparar\u00e1 m\u00e1s algarrobina.\n\nEulalia es una madre que d\u00eda a d\u00eda da todo de s\u00ed para seguir adelante y progresar junto a su familia. Ella se encuentra agradecida con los prestamistas de Kiva y nos comenta que gracias a su primer cr\u00e9dito pudo obtener mejores ventas y captar m\u00e1s pedidos de sus productos.\n\n","en":"Eulalia, age 42, lives with her husband and their two children in the Narihual\u00e1 village in the Catacaos district, Piura province, Piura region.  It is located 3 hours and 30 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThe desire to get her children ahead drove Eulalia and her husband to work selling \u201calgarrobina\u201d (jelly made from a base of carob fruit) and honey.  She currently sells this product at the bus terminals in the city of Piura.  Her husband sells it at the city of Chimbote.  They make the algarrobina in their house, and they get the honey from beekeepers in the area.  Both products are bottled to later be sold to the public.\r\n\r\nEulalia has previously worked with a Kiva loan.  She used her first loan to expand her business by purchasing more honey in order to start selling it in other districts.  She is currently requesting 800 PEN to buy supplies for making more algarrobina.\r\n\r\nEulalia is a mother who gives all of herself everyday in order to keep getting ahead and to progress together with her family.  She is grateful for the Kiva loans.  She tells us that, thanks to her first loan, she was able to have better sales.  She was also able to get more orders for her product.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":550023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies to make carob fruit jelly","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Narihual\u00e1 - Catacaos - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":38.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":38.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":39.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":42.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.82,"local_amount":306.18,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":326.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878309,"comment":null},{"amount":59.78,"local_amount":159.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":170.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618340,"comment":null},{"amount":61.88,"local_amount":165.01,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":175.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832736,"comment":null},{"amount":63.52,"local_amount":169.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":180.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T13:59:47Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205718,"name":"Leng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Leng S., 27, lives in Phnom Penh city, in Cambodia.

However, in subsequent years of growth, the dreams never leave us and always accompany us in our day-to-day business.  They define and make our actions concrete, directing them into a set channel, constantly feeding us additional energy and enthusiasm and always preparing us to have determination to achieve these dreams.  At an older age, when more than half a life has been lived, a person wants more peace and be more settled, and does not have the passion and drive that he had in his youth.  Zhamysh M. is the leader of this group.  She is sixty years old, but has a dream that gives her additional strength and makes her feel much younger.  Although her husband is retired, he tries to help Zhamysh with everything.  Zhamysh, her husband and their son opened a store in 2005, and this store has been the primary source of their income since then.  Having saved the profits, they were able to buy a plot of land.  And Zhamysh started to dream of building a big restaurant.  She can run this business with her husband, younger son and his wife, who currently works at the store.  Zhamysh requested this loan in order to invest money into renewal of sales.\r\n\r\nZhamysh\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nSharshebubu T. is 59 years old.  She raised three children and now lives with her younger daughter.  In order to support herself and her daughter, Sharshebubu sells flatbread, samsas and small bread.  Her daughter also works and helps her mother.  Sharshebubu requested this loan because she wants to invest money into home improvements.\r\n\r\nRahat M. is 28 years old.  Her husband is a machinist, and Rahat is an entrepreneur.  Several years ago, she started her own business and opened a plastic windows and doors manufacturing factory.  Her income is about ten thousand som.  Rahat currently needs help.  She needs a loan in order to buy manufacturing supplies.\r\n\r\nKubanychbek Azyrkulova is 31 years old.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Life obstacles and difficulties make people stronger and wiser. They give us the experience which later helps us improve our lives and make a better living. The heroes of our story also regard the difficulties in life just as good practical lessons for the future and definite steps toward a better life. \r\n\r\nFeruzahon M. is the leader of this group. She is forty-two and has four children. One of her children is disabled. He has a disability of the 3rd degree. Her husband is in Russia at the moment. He has gone there in search of a job. To provide for the family, Feruzahon tends a cow and a calf and is occupied with farming. Her eldest daughter works as a seamstress and thus helps her mother to meet their daily needs.  \r\n\r\nDue to cattle breeding, farming, and her husband\u2019s support they have been able to build a new house. Recently they have even managed to repair three rooms. Feruzahon is planning to marry off her daughter and provide her disabled son with a good treatment. But to achieve all this she needs to save sufficient funds. Therefore, Feruzahon has decided to apply for this loan to buy a cow to raise. \r\n\r\nHalidahon M., 46, is a mother of three children. Her eldest son is a baker and her daughter is a seamstress. Halidahon\u2019s husband works as a private builder. Currently Halidahon is engaged in the repair of their house. She needs this loan to finish the repair and prepare for her son\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nOdina A., 47, is a farmer. She used to grow wheat in the past, but now she grows potatoes and sunflowers. As for her husband, he is working in Russia. Odina has two children. Now, she needs a loan to purchase mineral fertilizers for potatoes and sunflowers. \r\n\r\nHalimahon I., 48, is divorced. She is looking after her old mother and her two children. To provide for the family, Halimahon is engaged in cattle breeding and also works as a nurse. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase three sheep for fattening and resale. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In daily life, people engaged in business do not usually have time and eagerness to discuss current issues and talk politics as they have a general idea that politics and decisions of political leaders have only a small impact on their individual lives. Twenty years ago, when the collapse of Soviet Union took place, people living in the republics within did not even realize the far reaching consequences of this event. One of those consequences was the halt of almost all major industrial factories, which led to the increase in unemployment and deterioration of economic conditions. Consequently people began to leave their homelands in mass for foreign lands in search of jobs and ways of earning a wage. Saidahon T. is the leader of this group. She is thirty two years old. Her husband is working in the  Russian Federation. Every now and then he sends money to his family, which consists of five members: himself , Saidahon and their three children. Their eldest daughter is ten. She has already started helping her mother doing some light work around the house.  Saidahon prefers not to depend on her husband\u2019s support for a living and is engaged in cattle breeding. She also has a cow and sells milk. Saidahon hopes to obtain this loan to purchase wood for building. \r\nSaidahon\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nDiloramhon M., 39, has three children. She trades in foodstuffs. Her husband is a car maintainer. Diloramhon manages to earn 200$ a month. Now she needs this loan to purchase soft drinks and ice - cream. During the summer, this is very profitable trade. \r\n\r\nEtiborhan O., 59, is a widow. She has two children, who live separately. Etiborhan used to work in a hospital, but left because of the  low salary  and started to raise cattle. Now she has two sheep and a cow. Etiborhan hopes to obtain this loan and purchase two calves.\r\n\r\nKuranbaeva N., 31, is a mother of two children. She and her husband are engaged in cattle breeding. Now they have four sheep and a cow. N. decided to apply for this loan as they need funds for building their new house.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Elvira\u2019s sister (mother of her nieces) is a housewife and is dependent on her husband\u2019s small income as a hired laborer. Aside from supporting the needs of her parents, Elvira also wanted to help  support her sister and her nieces. \r\nA way Elvira realized to have a source of income to support her dream of improving her family\u2019s standard of living is by having her own business. With that vision, she joined ASHI in 2004 and has put up a small variety store which sells groceries, foodstuffs and beverages. Eventually, as the amount of loan she is qualified to request from ASHI increased because of maintaining an excellent credit rating (business rating, attendance to center meetings, and repayment rating) inventories of her store increased as well as her profit. Looking back on their lives before she had her own business, now it\u2019s quite different, and financially life has improved. \r\nWith the loan Elvira  is currently requesting, she hopes to enhance her other business which is hog fattening. After four months of fattening her hogs, they will be sold either alive or slaughtered directly to people in their village and\/or in the market. Proceeds from this business would augment the proceeds of her store and therefore, Elvira will be able to raise her family out of poverty.

S. has successfully paid her first Kiva loan! With the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lend\/156382\">loan<\/a>, she purchased more piglets, grew them and already sold them in the market. She is so thankful for your support and the opportunity to borrow money from Kiva. Norma is very happy that she was able to buy and sell the animals without delay because of the loan. She wishes to access a larger loan to expand her hog-raising business of buying and selling of pigs so she can earn more profit. Norma thanks Kiva for providing her with opportunity to increase her income. Your support is important to her family and they are very grateful.\r\n\r\nNorma\u2019s biggest dream is to have a successful pig farm someday. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty. The financial opportunity of hog fattening is one of the best ways to help provide for her family and she very much wants to lift her family out of shortage. Over the years, she has provided for her family by other work involving hog raising, including slaughtering and tending to farming business in her village.\r\n\r\nNow she is proposing another Kiva loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos for hog fattening, a common business for people in her area suffering from poverty. Norma will buy additional piglets, sacks of feed and supplements and vitamins for the piglets. She will raise them for approximately four to six months until they are ready for sale.\r\n\r\nWith the support of ASHI, a Kiva partner, she is hopeful that her hog-fattening business will generate steady income to improve her financial stability and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":550162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

O. Francis began his business after he dropped out of school when his parents could no longer afford his fees. At his young age, he already has responsibilities: he is married and has one child of his own to take care of, plus his wife.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances, Francis is destined for success on the basis of his strong sense of optimism and strength of character. His customers have been benefitting from his good human and customer relationship skills in this short time he has been operational.\r\n\r\nWith the confidence Francis is carrying himself around with, his business\u2019s future prospects look brighter.

She and her husband want to save for their own house where they can raise a family since they do not yet have children. Silvia needs capital to purchase tools for her business such as hairdryers, flat irons, and to arrange an ambience to give better service to her customers, who are the source of her daily income. \r\n\r\nAll the members of the group are multifaceted, meaning they work in all kinds of fields. They like to work hard, and they know how to do business. The members sell food, groceries, chickens, soft drinks and empanadas, clothing, vegetables, jewelry, and offer public transport. \r\n\r\nThe members do not compete with one another because everyone has a different business. They all do well because they go to different places to sell their merchandise or offer their services. For example, Susana sells empanadas and \u201cmasitas,\u201d a type of pastry, and has clients that place orders by the day.  Her business provides her with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to grow the members\u2019 businesses and attract more clients to increase income and improve quality of life for the families.

They are all very hard-working and responsible, they all know each other very well since they live in the same area, and they trust their group members completely.\r\n\r\nRa\u00fal is the secretary of the group.  He is the father of three children and is married.  He and his wife raise chickens in their barn, which Ra\u00fal built from the ground up.  He is very hard-working, and this is why he is the featured group member.  He needs the loan to buy feed for his chickens since the capital he had was invested in acquiring automatic feeders and beds for the egg-laying hens.  In this case, he is responsible for raising the chickens, and his wife sells the products, so they work together very closely.\r\n\r\nThe other members work selling cosmetics, food, groceries, clothing, barbecued meat, soft drinks and beverages and work in domestic service and masonry.  As for the competitive environment, the members agree that competition is high, but they know how to change their products to items in greater demand or change their selling location to sell all their products.  The other members who offer services have regular customers.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used for the acquisition of merchandise, supplies, work tools, and to invest in new businesses as in the case of Maria Eliane, who works in domestic services and wants to have additional income from selling kebabs at a stand at her mother-in-law's house.  With regard to loan experience, the members have some since they are now in a second cycle with the institution, showing that they know how to run their businesses and being responsible with their obligations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":550394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eliane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26975,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1806.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1827.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1848.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1870.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1891.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1913.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1936.24},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1956.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2024.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2028.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2051.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2076.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.39},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":298.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205932,"name":"Xeraxon Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Juana T., es una persona mayor de edad, pero a salido hacia adelante gracias al trabajo que realiza, ella se desempe\u00f1a a la crianza de gallinas desde hace varios a\u00f1os y ha decidido unirse a dos personas m\u00e1s con el proposito de ampliar su capital de trabajo a los que denominan este grupo Xeraxon, estas se\u00f1oras residen en en el Barrio Xeraxon del municipio de Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1, y esperan obtener mejores ganacias por medio de la inversiopn del pr\u00e9stamo que solicitan a ASDIR, las otras dos integrantes de este grupon se dedican a la venta de granos basicos y venta de latas de aluminio para ser recicladas. \nEsta personas son de escasos recursos por lo que esperan seguir trabajando y con ello mejorar el ingreso familiar de cada una.

Thanks to the care and techniques his father taught him, he was abe to have a harvest on the first try. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to transport the sacks of product from his filed to town. His work is very profitable, because it allows him to continue investing in his land, cover his necessities, help his family and save for new challenges in the future, like having more coffee plantings, because it is in demand. He also wants to study accounting in the city. This is his second loan with  MFP, and once again he is committed to not letting the other members of the group down, because he is happy with his community bank. With the loan he is asking for, he will buy 20 sacks of fertilizer which will protect his plantings. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":550435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 20 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1423,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588199,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:59:35Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205941,"name":"Maria Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

They are a couple who want to be well set-up before becoming parents, because they don't want their children to lack anything. For two years, Edgar has farmed coffee and bananas on his own farmlands, which he inherited from his mother-in-law. He also works as a labourer on the land of some landowners, earning about 20 soles per day. His wife does housework but helps him at harvest time. His favourite part of his job is clearing the weeds from his land and harvesting his fruits; on the other hand, it is difficult to keep his fields safe from pests which hurt productivity. But he knows that in agriculture, one always earns something useful, and thus he considers agriculture to be profitable and he wants to expand his farmlands to keep growing coffee.\r\nHe is sure that he will become the best coffee producer in the area and, in order for his wife to also have economic benefits he will install a food store or a clothing store in their house. This is the second time he has taken out a loan with MFP, and as he already knows how the community group works together, he is happy to keep working with such very responsible and honest people. With the requested loan, he will buy 7 bags of fertilizer, and wood, nails and corrugated iron to finish the construction of the second floor of their home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":550442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"7 bags of fertilizer and materials for home completion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588200,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:03:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205945,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cPEROLNIYOC\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en la provincia de Urubamba perteneciente al departamento del Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia es la Sra.

He is 35 years old and married to Karina, who is 25.  They have a young daughter named Paola, who is three years old, and live in their own home in the town of Sanchirio Palomar in La Merced.  His daughter is the driving force behind his life.  For this reason, Hugo strives each day to learn all the technical aspects of farming so that he can have a successful harvest.  Together with his wife, he plants coffee and bananas on their own land that they have worked on tirelessly for five years.  Among the obstacles they must battle against are inclement weather and pests.  What he enjoys most about his work is clearing his land because it enables his crops to become strong and fruitful.  However, the most difficult part is transporting his crops to the city market.  Since the work is profitable, Hugo is able to live comfortably and continue making improvements to his farm in hopes of greater productivity.  Later on, he plans to open a grocery store in his home to generate more revenue.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.  Hugo is happy to continue working with his Communal Bank and was chosen to join its board of directors.  With the loan he requested, Hugo will buy several sacks of fertilizers and supplies to help avoid pests.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":550453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizers & farming supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T07:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1849.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588201,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:46:09Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205949,"name":"Guillermina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cPEROLNIYOC\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en la provincia de Urubamba perteneciente al departamento del Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia es la Sra.

She is a hardworking woman who shares her life with her husband \u00c1ngel, who is 25, and their two year old daughter Luz Clarita.  For more than two years, they have leased farmland on which they grow coffee and bananas.  Judith and her husband have worked to generate more income to help cover the household expenses.  At the same time, her husband works the fields of other farmers.  He earns 20 PEN each day, but during the harvest season there is twice as much work, so Judith is also hired for this job.   What she enjoys most is living in the country since the plants and the sounds of the animals convey a peace that makes her happy.  On the flip side, she dislikes transporting her crops to the city over great distances since the sacks are heavy.  However, she says the effort is worth it.  Judith indicates the services she utilized have been quite substantial now that she has the chance to save toward the purchase of her own land in hopes of increasing production.

He shares his life with his parents and with one of his 10 siblings, since the elder ones live in Lima looking for better work opportunities.\r\n\r\nSince he was very small, N\u00edger has been taught techniques for growing coffee and bananas, and during these seven years he has learned everything about this job.  Now, he knows how to manage his schedule well.  He wakes up at 5 in the morning to take care of his land, and on his return he prepares food for his parents.  Later he goes to school, where he puts all his effort into being the best in his class.  What he likes most about his work is harvesting because he will see a reward for his hard work.  He knows that this land he farms is the inheritance his parents gave him, and he will not abandon it since, thanks to it, he has a good income and can pay for his studies and the household expenses, among other things.  His priority is to buy more farmland to increase his production, mainly of bananas.  He also plans to build a large, comfortable house in the city in order to open a hardware store.  This will help him to fulfill one of his greatest desires, which is to study medicine.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan N\u00edger has had with MFP, and he has shown himself to be a very punctual and enthusiastic member.  He is well-liked for this in his communal bank, where he likes to work.

the fact that Menda S. J.\u2019s three children, aged from 20 to 27, are already adults with her two eldest now having their own family, she still doesn\u2019t want to resign from her career of being a mother to them. She wants to support their lives and those of their own families until they can get out from the umbrella of poverty. Menda\u2019s husband was unemployed and that has added to the challenges of her life as a woman and the need to become productive. \r\n\r\n<p>With faith that one day she will be able to find a way to improve the life of her family, Menda was very happy to learn about ASHI way back in 2005. Then Menda and her husband agreed that she must join ASHI so she could request a loan which would be their source of financial capital to start up a business to earn a daily income. They thought of setting up a small eatery since her husband is a good cook. \r\n\r\n<p>After several loans from ASHI, their eatery has eventually grown and has been sustained. Menda has also been able to finance a 'buy and sell' business in partnership with her unemployed eldest son. Proceeds are equally divided between them so her son can support his own family's needs. The loan will be used to purchase bulk ingredients for cooking foods for her eatery. Some of the loan will be used to purchase bulk onions, salt and garlic for her son's 'buy and sell' business.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible, Menda wants to grow and stabilize her eatery and her 'buy and sell' business through the support of loans through ASHI. Proceeds of her business would enable her to support her dream of sending her two children back to school until they graduate from college so they can have a different kind of life in the future - a life that is not poor.

Though her store is currently small selling only a few varieties of grocery items, foodstuffs and beverages as per the definition of  \u201csari-sari\u201d, Bernadita is still hopeful that her aspirations will come true in future as she is able to request another loan after paying off the previous one. This will help her to support the growth of her business resulting in much greater profit.\r\n\r\nBecause life was very poor for Bernadita before she joined ASHI and her husband is only a small-time hired laborer, she wasn\u2019t able to support the education of her five older children. All of them have only reached high school thus they are not able to be employed where they would receive a regular higher salary. Despite this, Bernadita still feels happy because her two sons are able to have their own livelihood as a security guard and a hired driver. Nevertheless, she still wants her three younger children to be able to graduate from college and have their own careers in future which is much better that what she and her husband have.

It is composed of nine women all from the same \u201cBanc Villageois\u201d and the same village. Their mutual affinity brought them together. They are from 30 to 60 years old and are the mothers of at least two children.\r\n\r\nThere is a large weekly market in the village that draws thousands of people every week. This means that there is a constant business activity in the village and it contributes to the economic development of the town and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe new loan to the solidarity group will allow it to strengthen and diversify its economic activities. Their activities are structured around the sale of local cereals, seafood products, peanuts and ice cream for those who own a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nMrs. Diouma D., the president of the solidarity group, is on the right of the photo wearing a large yellow \u201cboubou\u201d wrapped in a white scarf.

She has been selling \u201cbeignets\u201d and condiments for four years. Her funding has allowed her to bolster her small business.

By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.\r\n\r\nMiralyn is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional working capital. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Miralyn aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She got married in August 2009 and lives with her husband in a traditional Mongolian housing tent, called a ger, neighboring her mother's home. Their life condition is good and their furniture is quite new, because the couple just got married. The husband works as a porter at Narantuul market, loading and hauling luggage and goods.  He earns 200,000 MNT wage per month. They have not planned to have a baby yet. Her mother, G., has been running a shoe sales business for a long time and purchased a stall at the market for her daughter, Mungunzul. Mungunzul has not got much business experience yet, so she asks help from her mother.

with her supportive husband and six loving children, 44-year-old Cencia R. hails from one of the most depressed areas of the municipality of Pandan, in Antique Province. The area lacks access to markets, hospitals, and a good standard of education due to very poor road conditions and very few vehicles for transportation, and because of this Cencia and her family are not able to the enjoy standard of living others do. Cencia was not able to send her three eldest children to college and has not been able to make her business stable. Her husband is just a hired driver who earns a small amount of money every day. The income generated by her business is a great opportunity to augment her husband\u2019s income, yet it has not been enough to supply all the things her children need, especially for their education. In spite of that, Cencia and her husband have never stopped dreaming and hoping to improve their standard of living. They keep on inspiring and motivating their children to hold on to life and face the challenges it throws at them. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, Cencia got to know about ASHI and realized the opportunity it brings for the achievement of her dreams. She has been able to put up a small variety store through the loans she has gotten. This business has improved their standard of living. It also helps people in their village get access to the most common needs for their everyday life. Cencia is requesting a much larger loan through ASHI to grow her business further until it becomes sustainable. The proceeds of her business will be used to support the education of her other three children who will go to school until they graduate from college and have a better life in the future.

P., 40, is making sure that her family has enough to provide for their daily needs. She is a single mother with two children. She makes sure that she earns well so that her family can have a better life. She has been managing her own food stall business while also selling ready-to-wear items and silver jewelry for quite some time now. \r\n<p>\r\nFebe has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she has used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 50,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more ready-to-wear items, silver jewelry and raw ingredients needed to continue production of her food stall business. \r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She also dreams of being able to put up her own commercial space. \r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.

Janeth E. dreams of her two children (10 and 12 years old) graduating from college. For her, good quality and a higher level of education is the only wealth she can leave to her children once her life is over. This could not be stolen away from them by anyone and would lead them towards a brighter future. Their diploma from college would give them employment that will provide them with a stable and sound compensation to support their needs. With this dream, Janeth and her husband work hard to earn money. \r\n<p>\r\nJaneth joined ASHI in 2008 and has received several loans since then. With those loans, she has been able to have a source of financial capital to support the growth of her husband\u2019s fishing business as well as providing herself with the livelihood activity of fish selling. The proceeds they get out of their business go to the needs of her children and the entire family. Since then, their life has eventually changed a little. With the loan she is requesting now, Janeth is optimistic that someday she will finally bring her family out of poverty by making her business stable and profitable.
