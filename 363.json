She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \n\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 11,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying stocks needed to replenish her current product inventory.

She receives a monthly salary of  2000.00 meticales as well as a variable work bonus that depends in part on the number of court cases being tried. She uses her earnings to cover household expenses and also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nLili had taken out loans before with Banco Procredit, but later decided not to continue working with them. She heard about Hluvuku from neighbors of hers who had taken advantage of the services it provides. This is her first loan, in the amount of 10,000.00 meticales. She plans to use it to buy construction materials (iron, support beams, cement, sand and other items) to continue with her home improvement project. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay this loan as agreed, in order to be eligible to take out others in the future. She would like to take out other loans in order to finish working on her house and then furnish it, in order to offer her family better living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

M. is 28, and she lives in the Moraz\u00e1n department.  She lives with her two children.  She has a nine year old daughter who goes to school and a 15 month old baby.  She also lives with her 68 year old grandmother who helps her take care of her daughters and do the household chores.\r\n\r\nElba makes empanadas.  This is a typical dish made with a banana base, which is formed into dough.  It is shaped into a small ball and has a milk or bean filling.  Then it is fried and served with sugar on top.  The empanadas are made in her house.  Her grandmother helps with the process because they make a fair amount.  She sells them to middle school students at a school in her area.  She also sells them at home with help from her grandmother.  Elba is in charge of selling them away from the school as a traveling vendor in neighborhoods and cantons.  Elba puts forth a lot of effort to sell all of her product everyday because it is the only source of income that she has.  She is the only one supporting her family and paying all of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nThat is the reason she is asking for Integral for a loan.  With the loan she will be able to buy a larger quantity of bananas, milk, beans, sugar, and oil.

She lives with her husband and two sons, ages 8 and 5, and baby daughter, age 1.  Carmen sells plastic products, such as food or water storage containers.  She also sells small chairs and different types of cosmetics.  She sells all of these products on foot, making a daily income, most of which she must spend on her family and on household expenses.  This makes it difficult for her to invest in her business and making it difficult for her to grow it.  For this reason, Carmen is requesting a loan through Integral, so that she can have the necessary funds to buy cosmetics in bulk, so that she can offer various types at various prices, allowing her to attract more customers.  Carmen works hard every day for the well-being of her family.  She would like to give only the best to her three children and ensure that they are never in need of their basic requirements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

Each member has applied for a loan of 200,000 colons which will be used to make general investments in the expansion of their productive activities.\n\nThe women of this group are engaged in various entrepreneurial projects including plantain harvesting, the rearing and sale of livestock (poultry products) and the purchase of catalogue products for resale.\n\nSpecifically, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of all necessary materials, nutrients, and equipment that are used to plant and harvest plantains. Additionally, this loan will be used to increase working capital and facilitate the purchase of various household and clothing products which will be sold at a later date in the Bratsi community. Finally, this loan will enable group members to buy livestock (chickens) and animal feed to ensure the good health of animals and, in turn, guarantee a high quality final product.\n\nAccording to the group, a common goal is to secure a steady stream of revenues in order to maintain a constant level of working capital. This will allow the women to continually re-invest in their businesses and attract new clients. The women hope to increase sales so they will be able to use the revenues to help pay for their children\u00b4s studies.\n\nThe women of this group face many obstacles. The lack of job opportunities in Bratsi has led the members to take it upon themselves to create a way to make a living. The hot and humid climate of the Caribbean region creates an environment where livestock become susceptible to diseases. Maintaining the health of their animals has been a constant struggle for the members of this group. For the women involved in the planting and harvest of plantains, flooding has caused problems. As they cannot predict when a flood might occur, their livelihoods are at the mercy of Mother Nature.\n\nA major obstacle for all the women of this group has been a lack of financial resources to develop their entrepreneurial activities. This loan will help extend the reach of financial services to a poor community of hardworking women.\n\nThe name of this group, \u00a8United Women\u00a8, symbolizes the philosophy of solidarity and support expressed amongst members. These women have banded together because, they say, \u00a8individually it would be more difficult for us.\u00a8\n\nSara M. G. is the president of this group. This will be her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Sara is in the business of rearing and selling chickens and eggs. She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of livestock and animal feed in order to expand her business and sell more poultry products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":499527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

They are on average 34 years old with four children. They all live in the Hamdallaye district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbors, relatives and their belonging to the same women's traditional neigborhood association for sanitization.\r\n\r\nThis group essentially trades in a variety of items. Having repaid two previous loans without incident, they are on their third group loan, which will be used to buy 25 pieces of \"pagnes-wax\" (a West African term for highly decorative and colourful fabric), five sets of embroidered \"pagnes\", a parcel of  second-hand clothes, three boxes of ointments, two bags of rice and eight bags of millet. These cereals will be made into traditional flat cakes (\"fourou-fourou\" and \"mommi\"). To make the flat cake, one has to hull the cereals, take out the bran, wash them, make them into semolina, fill them with either a salty or sweet mushy cereal according to the customer's taste, then add a bit of yeast. The resulting dough is then grilled to produce the flat cake.\r\n\r\nThey get their supplies of \"pagnes\", second-hand clothes and creams in Bamako (the capital of Mali), and their other products at the big market in S\u00e9gou and at the fairs in Konodimini, Siribala and Boussin. They retail these products for cash or on credit to a customer base made up of men and women, at home, and wandering through the various neighborhoods and at the Ch\u00e2teau market.\r\n\r\nThey plan to make an average monthly profit of 25,000 FCFA. This profit will be used to cover the children's healthcare and for savings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

D. M., 59, lives in San Miguel department with her husband, Carlos M. and their only son, who is 18 years old and a student.\r\n\r\nCristina has her own business, which is a grocery store.  She started her business wanting to improve her family\u2019s economy.  Her husband, with much effort, managed to launch the business.  It started off with few inventory items; it was all that their finances permitted.  Gradually, however, the business has grown but it still lacks many products.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Cristina has called upon Integral hoping to get a loan that will allow her to increase her stock inventory, above all with such products that are in highest demand in her location.  She does all this with the great desire to be able to improve her quality of life and to live in a more relaxed way with respect to family finances because profits earned are of great help to meet household expenses.  This then allows Carlos to be able to invest more in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nCristina is a very responsible and hard-working woman who is completely dedicated to her store and to her household chores.  She always takes care of her customers in the best way possible because, it\u2019s thanks to them, that she can obtain her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

He lives in the Reparto Schik neighborhood with his wife and 12-year-old son, who is in elementary school. \r\n\r\nMarlon sells movies on DVD, music DVDs, videos, remote controls, cases, CD cases and whatever else his customers order from him.  He launched his business using savings from his job in construction.  This was exhausting work and often he would go for weeks without any job offers.  He started to put away some savings to set up his CD sales shop.  Gradually, he invested more and now this is his sole source of income.  \r\n\r\nAmong his challenges are power failures.  When this happens his customers are unable to sample the CDs and his sales drop because they don\u2019t trust that the CD will be in good condition.\r\n\r\nHe will use the funds to buy cell phone accessories, movies, music, controls, radio batteries, cell phone chargers and other items that will generate profits.\r\n\r\nHis plans are to make improvements to his shop because it\u2019s currently just secured with zinc metal sheeting and he fears that robbers could gain access.  For this reason, improvements are urgent and he hopes to do them for the benefit of his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is a tenacious woman who is always looking after her family\u2019s future.  This is her third loan with the foundation.  She became aware of the institution thanks to a neighbor and to her daughter, who became a member before she did, and  invited her to participate in the bank.\r\n\r\nMariana raises farm animals like: cows, chickens, goats, guinea pigs.  She sells them on Thursdays at the Cuenca free cattle market.  Sometimes she also sells them from home to her neighbors; she also farms her own farmlands.\r\n\r\nShe lives in Turi parish, Santa Anita.  She is 43 years old, married, and has 4 children, who are 25, 24, 23 and 10 years of age.  Her first and third sons are married and live independently with their own families.  Her 24-year-old daughter is single and is employed; she helps out economically both with household expenses and with educational costs for her younger sister.  Her husband is in construction, an occupation that has made it possible for him to get his family ahead in live and, through much sacrifice, to build their own home.\r\n\r\nShe will use the new loan to buy chicks, corn, nutritionally balanced feed and vitamins for the birds and to enlarge her business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to gradually increase her chicken and guinea pig production so that she can have a large nursery and become a distributor of them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Ileana says she opened her business to earn an income for her children and because she likes the work. 'Ili\u00b4s Nails' was opened with an initial investment of 25,000 colons.

She dedicates the hours from 10 am to 6 pm (7 days a week) to her business. Ileana\u00b4s specialty and passion is working with nails. Nail painting, applying decorative (fake) nails and giving manicures and pedicures represents the majority of Ileana\u00b4s workload. She has employed her two daughters who work roughly 12 hours a week and earn 25,000 colons each (per week). One of her daughters specializes in cosmetics and the other works with hair. As a team, they can provide a range of beauty services including hair, nails and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ileana\u00b4s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer.

She is well aware of the highly competitive market that exists for beauty services and products in her community. \r\n\r\nIleana\u00b4s revenues have been affected by competitors under-cutting each other\u2019s prices for services in an effort to attract new clients and to keep old ones. Ileana is confident that she will maintain the loyalty of her clients because she uses high quality products and is not willing to compromise that quality in exchange for profits.

She hopes this will help to improve her living conditions and, as a result, that of her family as well.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":499604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-03-02T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2.42,"local_amount":50.85,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874781,"comment":null},{"amount":947.58,"local_amount":19949.15,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":19964.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-03T01:16:26Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182122,"name":"Carlos Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Carlos trabaja como cadete de taxi desde hace varios a\u00f1os, su edad es de 54 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposa se han esforzado para hacer las mejoras necesarias a su vivienda, ella tiene tres hijos los cuales estudian, y labora para un almac\u00e9n, las dificultades de don Carlos es cuando se le da\u00f1a el vehiculo y no trabaja lo cual no cubre la alimentaci\u00f3n a sus hijos.

When Jose\u2019s boss of eight years decided to abandon his post selling audio parts at San Jose\u2019s Berryessa Market, the couple made the decision to go into business for themselves. And so, drawing upon Jose\u2019s years of experience as a salesman and Vanessa\u2019s accounting savvy (her area of study in school in Mexico), DGO Audio was born.\r\n\r\nJose and Vanessa have been successfully selling since April of 2008. In addition to their weekends spent at the flea market, Jose works full-time and Vanessa cares for their two daughters. \u201cI love having our own business because it allows me to make my own schedule and spend time with the girls,\u201d says Vanessa.\r\n\r\nOf the business name, Jose explained that, \u201cDGO is the initials of the city of Durango, Mexico, where we are from. That is well known in the region, so our name helps attract Hispanics that shop at the market. It builds on our sense of community.\u201d The pair said that they enjoy working to run the business together and are confident that they will be able to continue growing. While there are other audio-parts sellers operating at the market they distinguish themselves with different brands, lower prices, and a familial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nJose will use the $2,500 loan to make monthly trips to Los Angeles, where they can find a much larger supply of car radios, speakers, tweeters and other radio components at a better value to sell in San Jose. These trips will help their business to remain competitive and, ultimately, grow. \u201cThis loan opens up possibilities we didn\u2019t have before. With a little investment, we have the chance to earn much more. In a few years, when the economy is better, we would like to open our own store,\u201d says Jose.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":499694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

T. is 44 and married with 6 children (ages 5 - 19).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mataniu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Mataniu needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mataniu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mataniu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mataniu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 52 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup).  Sielaa has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sielaa needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 tala or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSielaa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sielaa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sielaa P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Mrs. Phally N. is a farmer who owns a small piece of land where she cultivates rice in order to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Sam Orat, is a motorbike taxi driver. Mrs. Phally N. works hard in her field, but she does not earn a lot of income because her rice field has infertile soil, and she does not have enough seeds to grow. Thus, Mrs. Phally N. decided to seek a loan to buy fertilizer and rice seeds to improve her yield of rice this year. She is a mother of three children, one of whom is a waiter.

She hopes that through the loan she is requesting through ASHI now, she will make her dream of rice wholesaling come true. The amount she is requesting will enable her to buy several sacks of rice, which will be supplied to a retailer in their village and in other neighboring villages. Through the support of her husband, she is optimistic that this kind of business will be successful and will become profitable in time. By then, Susan will have a cash flow for her family, especially for the needs of her three children (ages from one to nine years old). Because she knew and she felt through her inner core how hard it is to become poor and to live with it, she doesn\u2019t want her children to have that kind of life in the future.

She is 38 years old, married, and  is the mother of 6 children who are 18, 16, 14, 11, 8 and 4 years old. The 5 older children attend school. Alzira only studied through 5th grade, and didn't continue because of her parents' lack of financial resources. She lives with her family in their own home, and apart from her children she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nAlzira left Maputo for Boane in 1991 to join her husband, and they still live there today. She has had her own business for more than 18 years and does not have any other employees. She works around 10 hours every day. Her husband is also a business owner and helps to pay the household expenses. Alizira earns approximately 5500.00 Meticales each month, which go towards paying the household expenses. She also saves some money at home in order to cover any unforeseen needs. \r\n\r\nAlzira had previously taken out loans with the credit cooperative TCHUMA but later decided not to continue for various reasons. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] one day when she was passing by the Institution, as she entered and found out about the options available there. This is her 3rd loan, for the amount of 25,000.00 Meticales. She will use this money to buy capulanas [long pieces of fabric that have various uses] in order to increase and diversify the products she sells. Her earlier loans were for 13,000.00 Meticales e 18,000.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. Her main project is the construction of small houses to rent out. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to put towards her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

With low educational attainment, she believes that the only way she can attain this is by growing her own business since she cannot get employed in any government or private office. \r\n\r\nFortunately, she heard about ASHI and the services it offers to poor women. After she was recognized as an official member of the institution just recently, she requested a loan to start up a fish-selling business. \r\n\r\nShe expects that the profit from this business that is just getting started will be small.

She is 37 years old, married, and is the mother of 2 children who are 18 and 15 years old. Both children attend school. Celeste only studied through 9th grade, and didn't continue because of her parents' lack of financial resources. She lives in her own home with her husband, who works as a driver, and she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nShe left the neighborhood where she lived with her parents to go to the Jardim neighborhood with her husband. She has owned her own business for more that 2 years and doesn't have any other employees. She doesn't work on a fixed schedule but works around 12 hours a day. She earns approximately 5500.00 meticales each month, and uses this money to pay for household expenses. She also saves some money each week through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nCeleste has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (sand, cement, stones, bricks and other items) in order to improve her family's living conditions. Her earlier loans were for 13,000.00 Meticales e 18,000.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to put towards her business activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":499938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials (cement, stone, and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celeste ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":908.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":945.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":984.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1067.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1156.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1204.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1253.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1305.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1358.86},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1414.71},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1472.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1533.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1596.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1662.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.06,"local_amount":2178.08,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972126,"comment":null},{"amount":71.63,"local_amount":2292.01,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2310.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698688,"comment":null},{"amount":485.31,"local_amount":15529.91,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":15658.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916159,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T18:11:23Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182230,"name":"Alapo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alapo is a 55-year-old married man with four children.

He lives in a government house with his family, and also takes care of his mother and two nephews who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left Moamba for the city of Maputo in 1962, where he now has his own home. After returning from Tanzania, where he had been sent as a soldier, he began to work in Boane for the Ministry of Defense in 1975. He still works for the Ministry in administration and is responsible for logistics. He works around 8 hours a day. He has a monthly salary of 13.075.00 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account each month.\r\n\r\nAbdul had taken out loans before with the Banco Millenium Bimbank, but he decided not to continue for various reasons. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who have also benefited from working with the institution. This is his 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, stones, sand blocks and other items) in order to continue working on his construction project. His earlier loan was for 16,000.00 Meticales and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

He is 30 years old, married, and has 4 children whose ages are 14, 10 and 5 years, and 6 months. The 3 older children go to school. Salvador has a degree in Pedagogical Sciences. He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of two brothers who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left Zambezia for his sister's house in Maputo in order to continue with his education. After finishing his studies at the Instituto de Magist\u00e9rio Prim\u00e1rio [Institute for Primary Education] in Matola, he began to work for the Ministry of Education as a teacher. He continues to work in the same job today, with a relatively free work schedule. He has been employed by the Ministry of Education for more than 5 years and doesn't employ anyone else to help him. He has a monthly salary of  6444.44 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He is occasionally able to save some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nSalvador had taken out loans before with another bank (Novo Banco), but he decided not to continue for various reasons. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who have also worked with the institution. This is his 1st loan, for the amount of 25,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (zinc plates, stones, cement, sand and other items) in order to continue working on his construction project. His earlier loans from Novo Banco were for 15,000.00, 25,000.00 and 38,000.00 Meticales All were repaid and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to finish his house and also to start a business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":499978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase of construction materials (cement, blocks, and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador Caetano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1135.48},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1182.15},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1281.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1445.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1505.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1567.14},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1631.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1698.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1768.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1841.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1995.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2077.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":126.25,"local_amount":4072.6,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4073.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972129,"comment":null},{"amount":120.36,"local_amount":3882.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3883.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698691,"comment":null},{"amount":140.93,"local_amount":4546.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4547.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916162,"comment":null},{"amount":387.46,"local_amount":12498.53,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12501.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878580,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-13T19:19:25Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182243,"name":"Mrs. Leang Tom Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Leang T. is 48 years old and she is president of a village bank that consists of 22 people located in Prey Ampok village in Takeo province.

She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, nails, zinc plates and other items) in order to finish her construction project. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish her house and then furnish it.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is 38 years old, married, and is the mother of 4 children who are 18, 7, 4 and 2 years old. The two older children attend school. She only studied through 8th grade, and didn't continue because of an early pregnancy. She lives in her own home with her family and she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha for Boane with her parents when she was young. After marrying she continued to live in Boane with her family. Adelia has owned her own business since 2007. She learned how to run a business on her own at home, where she has one employee. She works selling perfumes and deodorants from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM each day. She earns approximately 800-1000 Meticales a day, and uses this money to pay for household expenses. She also saves some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nAdelia has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 25,000 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy merchandise (perfume, beauty creams, and other items) in order to increase the products she sells and satisfy her customers. Her earlier loan was for 12,000 Meticales and was used for the same purpose.\r\n \r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans in order to buy her own means of transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":499988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of beauty products, paper and other goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelia Silvino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1098.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1148.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1200.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1254.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1311.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1370.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1432.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1497.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1564.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1635.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1709.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1786.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1867.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1951.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2040.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2132.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.06},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.89},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.79,"local_amount":1670.51,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1670.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972131,"comment":null},{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":1849.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1849.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698693,"comment":null},{"amount":665.88,"local_amount":21480.14,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":21484.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916164,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-10T12:27:14Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182248,"name":"Savinh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Savinh D.

He is 32 years old, married, and is the father of 5 children who are 15, 8, 6, 4 and 2 years old. The 3 older children attend school. Orlando only studied through 6th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and also helps support his older sister, sending her money to cover her household expenses.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo for Boane when his brother sold his home. They set up residence there and continued with their business. Orlando works in a business that grows and sells bananas, called Bananalandia. He works around 8 hours a day. In his free time he works selling basic everyday necessities. He has a monthly salary of 1500.00 Meticales and an income from his business of around 3000.00 Meticales. He uses these earnings to cover household expenses and also saves some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nOrlando has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy products (sugar, rice, cooking oil, peanuts and other items) in order to increase his stock of merchandise. His earlier loans were for 3000.00, 6000.00 and 10,000.00 Meticales, and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for more loans for construction and to raise animals for sale in order to further develop his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

He is 47 years old, married, and has 4 children who are 19, 16, 10 and 6 years old. The children all attend school. Miguel only studied through 6th grade, and didn't continue because he had to fulfill the obligatory military service.

He currently works for a company called ARA SUL and has also run his own business for more than 10 years. He works around 6 hours a day and has an employee who helps him with his business. He has a monthly salary of 4523.00 Meticales and an income of 3000.00 Meticales per month from his business. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nMiguel has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is his 4th loan with Hluvuku, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy products (various types of used clothing) in order to increase his stock of merchandise. His earlier loans were for 10,000.00, 15,000.00 and 15,000.00 Meticales, and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for more loans in order to build a protective

She has owned her own business for more than 5 years and doesn't have any other employees. She works from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM. She  learned about this business from her mother 14 years ago, and earns approximately 1200.00 meticales a day. She uses this money to pay for household expenses, and also saves some money each month through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAdelaide has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is her 5th loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (sand, cement, iron, and other items) in order to continue with the construction of her home. Her earlier loans were for 4000.00, 8000.00, and 9000.00 Meticales, and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish building her house and to

He uses this to pay for household expenses and he even saves some in his bank account.  \n\nHe has had loans with the Millennium Bim bank, but he later decided not to continue with them.  He found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy construction material (rebar, support beams, cement, sand, etc.) in order to finish with his work [building his house].  The previous loan was for 7,000 MZN, for the same purpose.  \n\nIn the future, he would like to request more loans to perfectly finish and furnish his house in order to offer better living conditions to his family.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

She is 41 years old, married, and the mother of 5 children between 24 and 31 years old.  3 of her children attend university and the others are employed.  She is responsible for her niece who lives with her in her house.  She is not able to save any money because she has to pay for her children's university expenses; she has do to this as her husband lost his job after having problems at work.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of financial means, Ticana had to discontinue her studies in the 8th grade.  Years later, she left Manhi\u00e7a for Marracuene with her husband due to his job as Agriculture Director in that District where he governed for 5 years.  Because Ticana had level of schooling that was deemed adequate, the administrator invited her to work as his secretary.  However, he husband was transferred to the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland; she wasn't able to have a separate professional and family life, so she left her job.  After she arrived in Namaacha, she used the money that she had collected to start a business raising baby chicks.  She counts on the help of her husband, who is an expert agronomist.  Besides this business, she is also the owner of a meal stand.  The chicks require a lot of attention; she doesn't have a fixed schedule.  She raises at most 5 boxes with 100 chicks each, spending 40,000 MZN.  She resells each box for 100 MZN.  She has raised them in different stages in order to alternate her sales.  Her best product that she sells in her meal stand is already-cooked chicken.  From her stand, she makes of monthly profit of 10,000 MZN.\r\n\r\nThis is Ticana's 3rd loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first loan was for 15,000 MZN, which she used to buy chicks.  The second loan of 12,000 MZN was used to reinforce her chick-raising business.  She has asked for this third loan of 20,000 MZN for the same purpose.  She is confident that she can pay off the loan before the deadline arrives, as she is also an employee of CMVN (Municipal Council) in addition to being a businesswoman.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is a 28-year-old widow and mother to an 8-year-old son who goes to school.  Besides her son, she also cares for her mother, who lives in Gaza, by sending her 500 MZN every month to pay the person who takes care of her since she is very old.\r\n\r\nAtalia was only 6 years old when she moved from Maputo to the village of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland, owing to the separation of her parents.  She went to live with an aunt who mistreated her.  She began school very late, and when she was in 7th grade, she became pregnant, was thrown out of the house, and left school.  That same year she got a job in a restaurant, where she worked for 4 years.  She had to quit when she contracted tuberculosis (TB) and had to have treatments over the course of a year.  After her recovery, she got a job as an assistant at the Namaacha water company.  She has been a permanent employee there for more than 4 years, working from 7:00 am until 5:00 pm and earning 2,500 MZN monthly, but because of her husband's death she can no longer cover her expenses, since she lives in a rented house and pays 800 MZN per month.  She approached Hluvuku and Kiva to ask for a loan to purchase a title to some land and build a house on it.\r\n\r\nThis is Atalia's third loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva. The first, for 8,000 MZN, was used to purchase the title to her land, and the second loan of 12,000 MZN was to begin construction, which has been completed up to the roof beams.  These 15,000 MZN will be used to begin roofing the house, and soon she will be able to move in.  She is confident that she will pay ahead of time and ask for another loan to plaster the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She takes care of her mother, who lives in Maputo, by sending her 500 meticales monthly.  She can't save anything because she lives in a rented house.\r\n\r\nCristina moved to the village of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland when her husband abandoned her.  That same year she began her studies while living in her grandparents' house because her mother could not support her.  When she was in eighth grade, she became pregnant with her first daughter and was kicked out of the house, but since she understood salon work, her aunt invited Cristina to work together with her.  Some years later she chose to open her own beauty salon with the money she had saved, and she approached Banco Novo (another banking institution) asking for a loan of 20,000 meticales to strengthen her business.  She paid it off with no problems, but her business didn't earn enough because she had to rent the shop.  Some years later she managed to get a job as an assistant in a botany lab, working from 7:30 am until 3:30 pm and earning 1,825 meticales.  She had no time to take care of her business, so she employed someone, which left her bankrupt.  These days she does beauty work in her house on Saturdays and Sundays because of the demand she has had, and she sells a variety of clothing acquired in South Africa at the Shoprite informal market.\r\n\r\nThis is Cristina's fourth loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.

He has a senior high school education. Clifford sells palm oil and nut crackings for the making of palm kennel oil in Elmina. His wife is a petty trader. The loan acquired by Clifford will be used to purchase gas\/oil for his mill processor (machine) and palm fruits for making palm oil. Clifford uses his income to take care of his wife and dependents and for the general upkeep of the home. With the new profits from his expanded business, Clifford plans to save money for a good educational foundation for the children.\r\n\r\nTo prepare his locally made palm oil, Clifford gets his palm nuts from farmers. He washes them and boils them for about forty minutes until they become soft and tender. The cooked fruits are scooped into a big mortar and gently squashed with a pestle to squeeze out the juice covering the pulp while avoiding damaging the nut.

She is separated and lives with her three children, two of whom she still supports.  She lives in the \u201cEl Vichayal\u201d neighborhood, in the La Arena district in the Piura province.  This is a rural community, where most of the residents farm, raise livestock, and also sell \u201cchica\u201d a typical fermented beverage in Peru.  This zone is located in the Piura region, three hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling chicha from her home for the past two years.  She also raises penned animals and sells them to the businesses within the zone or slaughters them and uses the meat to prepare the food which she sells on the weekends, also out of her home.  These activities have helped her support her children and help get them ahead.\r\n\r\nAsunciona would like to open a small restaurant-bar in her home.  We know of the principal products she offers (chicha and food) and that she has loyal customers, and she wants to take advantage of this and her home\u2019s central location.  She is asking for her first loan for 800 PEN ($300) through Edpyme Alternativa, which she will use to buy tables and chairs to be able to give better service.  Asunciona is a hard working enterprising woman, very dedicated to her family.  Her greatest desire is to watch her sons become well off men with professional careers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":500154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Restaurant tables and chairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Vichayal - La Arena - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asunciona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":73.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":76.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":78.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.85},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.72},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":59.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934667,"comment":null},{"amount":21.08,"local_amount":56.2,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":60.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662270,"comment":null},{"amount":22.63,"local_amount":60.37,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":64.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694974,"comment":null},{"amount":22.84,"local_amount":60.89,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":65.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878019,"comment":null},{"amount":23.6,"local_amount":62.93,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":67.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618047,"comment":null},{"amount":24.58,"local_amount":65.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":70.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832450,"comment":null},{"amount":24.85,"local_amount":66.26,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":70.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099058,"comment":null},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":142.41,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":152.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529956,"comment":null},{"amount":86.02,"local_amount":229.38,"processed_date":"2011-09-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":245.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227183117,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-03T23:42:49Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182325,"name":"Abenawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abenawa E. is a single parent with three children.

He earned money from the sale of meat product such as  pork skins, butter, fried blood sausage among others. \r\n\r\nHis start as a home as a builder he owes to his father who taught him the trade, as it was how their family was sustained. He has 3 high-school age children with his wife who helps with the butchering and is also a seamstress to earn money.  Difficulties arose with swine flu [H1N1] as the butchering of pork was banned and sales dropped, so he is working with very little capital. \r\n\r\nThanks to the earnings from his other jobs, he acquired a truck with which he transports the pork and sells the meat but the maintenance of the truck is provided with money he has already invested in the truck in the form of tires.  His previous loan was used for the purchase of second-hand tires which made made money tight to provide maintenance on the truck.  With the new loan he would be able to make at the improvements to the truck without having to scrimp to invest in this essential business instrument.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Kellogg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":500162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase tires for the truck and provide necessary maintenance ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elias Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":900.09,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":946.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604587,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":899.91,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":946.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640059,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1893.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561854,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":946.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770772,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":946.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204663,"comment":null},{"amount":180,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3786.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465526,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-12T19:17:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182328,"name":"Diana Julissa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nDiana tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es separada y vive junto a sus dos hijos en el caser\u00edo El Vichayal, del distrito de La Arena, en la provincia de Piura, una comunidad rural donde la mayor\u00eda de habitantes se dedican a la agricultura, crianza y venta de animales y a la venta de chicha (bebida tipica del pa\u00eds).

According to them, this has benefited them greatly as they learned to invest, gain more orders, grow their businesses, and arrange their money.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":500296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy harvests of fruits and vegetables ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastiana  De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150.92,"local_amount":3100.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3174.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128872714,"comment":null},{"amount":158.31,"local_amount":3251.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3329.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136602728,"comment":null},{"amount":166.1,"local_amount":3411.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3493.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144638087,"comment":null},{"amount":174.31,"local_amount":3580.45,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3666.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151819929,"comment":null},{"amount":275.36,"local_amount":5655.96,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5791.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159559984,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T15:34:05Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182374,"name":"Jicaltepec Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO DE \"JICALTEPEC\" LLEVA ESE NOMBRE PORQUE ASI SE LLAMA LA LOCALIDAD DONDE HABITAN CERCA DE PINOTEPA NACIONAL OAXACA, LOS CLIENTES SE DEDICAN A COMERCIALIZAR ALIMENTOS,REBECA M.

She dreams of her youngest son obtaining a professional career in addition to having a place to live.  The loan will be invested in the purchase of fried items such as: fried potatoes, ingredients to make chicharron (cracklings), Salsa Bonatera (hot sauce), plastic bags, disposable plates, vegetable oil, and sweets.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Magaui has many years of experience in this business.  Magaui needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Magaui joined SPBD.    This is her 6th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Magaui's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Magaui N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 48 and married with 6 children (ages 10 - 20).  She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Savali has 2 years of experience in this business.  Savali needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Savali joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Savali's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Savali T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 35 and married with 6 children (ages 12 - 22).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Kalala has many years of experience in this business.  Kalala needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kalala joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Kalala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kalala P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 6 and 12).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lefine has 4 years of experience in this business.  Lefine needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lefine joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lefine's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lefine M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 28 and married with 1 child (3 years-old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Siamoa has many years of experience in this business.  Siamoa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Siamoa joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Siamoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siamoa S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

N. is 25 and married with 2 children (ages 10 and 13).  She is starting a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Fiapaipai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fiapaipai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiapaipai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiapaipai N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

N. is 28 and married with 2 children (ages 5 and 8).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Susi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Susi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Susi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Susi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Susi N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 31 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling sweets & confectionaries such as cookies & cakes in the local community.  Iokapeta has many years of experience in this business.  Iokapeta needs a loan of WST $1250 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Iokapeta joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Iokapeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Iokapeta F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 46 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Tepora has 2 years of experience in this business.  Tepora needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tepora joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tepora's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tepora A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She operates a mixed farm in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale, where she has been farming for over six years. Her primary income comes from the sale of eggs at the local market, and she also runs a charcoal-selling kiosk for additional income. She says that the main challenge she has faced in recent times was acquiring the necessary capital to expand her farm, but with these loans she is happy to have found a source of credit. \r\n\r\nAnnah recently completed her first loan through Juhudi Kilimo, and has now requested this loan for Kes. 30,000 to add more chickens to her farm and to increase the supply of feed. She is also factoring in expected costs of veterinary services that she may need to use in the future to ensure the success of her poultry project. \r\n\r\nOverall, Annah says that this loan will help her family become self-sustainable in terms of food and for covering education expenses. She is also hopeful that in the future she will be able to expand her stock of chickens and also acquire dairy animals for increased income.

Jason has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Jason is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to repair existing engine. This will be the 16th loan taken out by Jason from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":498526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair existing engine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Clarin, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.2055 123.7546","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jason","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128955018,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683447,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1534.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144717430,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-05T02:16:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:24:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182460,"name":"Kasmiro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Kasmiro R. is currently in the business of selling clothes and bedsheets and is requesting a loan to open up a food stall.
