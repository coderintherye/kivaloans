Pacion's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicitas P. is from the village of Bantay Solana, Cagayan. She is 40 years old. Felicitas is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is  \"Felicitas P.'s Group\".\r\n\r\nFelicitas is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Felicitas owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Felicitas has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of her raised pigs.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Felicitas joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felicitas is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Felicitas from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is 37 years old. Gemma is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGemma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from tending a canteen near the school. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients to cook more dishes and snacks to sell. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":727696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

A. is from the village of Katutungan, Wao, Lanao del Sur. She is 43 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marcelina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snack foods, milk, beverages, and food seasonings in the local community. Marcelina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marcelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marcelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Marcelina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, snack foods, and beverages to sell. This loan will be Marcelin'a third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Estelita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Estelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase materials needed to provide service. Estelita is requesting a new loan of 5.000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of her motorcycle. This loan will be Estilita's tenth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 43 yeas old, married, and the mother of 9 children, two of whom already live separately and seven are still in school. Her husband is a governmental employee in public service. Mbambu S. sells traditional local drink called \u201cmadrakwa juice.\u201d She has been in this business for several years. She just completed eight loan cycles with IMF Hekima, with the goal of bolstering her business capital. Mbambu S.\u2019s family depends on her business, especially since public employees in Congo are not paid regularly, and when they do receive their salaries, the pay level is so low that it does not last the family for the entire month, nor does it allow for savings. This new loan will help Mbambu S. to stock up with the new ingredients (raw matters) in order to prepare \u201cmandrakwa\u201d (five bags of corn, 50 kg of millet, 50 kg of flour, 50 kg of sorghum, heating wood etc). In addition, her goal is to  ensure the continuation of her business and to provide for proper education for her children. As a client of IMF, Mbambu S. is grateful to IMF Hekima for its actions in support of impoverished women who do not have access to traditional banking. The Ufalme group is composed of 20 members, mainly women. One of the group members [in the photo] is carrying a child on her back.

P. O. is 28 years-old and married. His wife runs a salon and they have three children aged between seven years-old and one year-old whom they hope to givea  good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHis business is located at a market in Nyalenda in Kisumu. Kisumu is the region of Kenya that harbours lake Victoria and is well known as the lake basin. He owns a barber shop in which he gives haircut services to the local people. He has been in this business for six years now and has managed to provide employment to one person.

She is married to 33 year-old Yover and has 3 children.  They live together in their own home which is located in Santa Fe community, a small village in Kimbiri district.  Zosima and her husband Yover are the pillars of their family.  Since she was a little girl, Zosima's parents taught her to work on the farm and she grew up with these talents.  She currently owns 3 hectares of land where she grows coffee  and coca leaf.  These plants are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac River Valley.  She has been working on her own land for 10 years.  At harvest time she hires laborers to pick her fruit so that she can harvest more quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat Zosima most likes about her work is collecting the fruit from her plants since this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing her with some reward, in the quality of her fruit.  She considers that the most difficult part of her work is transporting her produce from the farm to the wholesale centers in San Francisco and Quimbiri.  This is where she is offered the best prices for her beans and coca leaf.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty Zosima faces is that she doesn't have enough money to cover, in advance, the wages of the laborers who support her at harvest time.  For this reason, she is taking loans with MFP.  However, right now her main priority is sowing more coffee plantations because this is one of the plants that is in greatest demand on the market.\r\n\r\nThis is Zosima's first loan with MFP.

They live in the community of Sirenachayocc, where she owns a home that is full of happiness.  When she was 20 years old, Edilberta learned cultivation techniques and how to care for cacao plants.  However, all was not joy since she and her family experienced difficulties with their crops since there were no buyers in her community.  As a result, everything they had invested turned into a total loss.  Edilberta spent the next two years of her life paying off debts to suppliers and workers.  Sometime later she regained her confidence and continued to pursue farming in an aggressive manner.  This time she planted a new crop of coffee and her eventual sales increased steadily as compared to previous years.  She already has commitments from her customers and is stretched to the limit so that she can fulfill these orders efficiently.  Edilberta usually works with her husband, but during the harvest, she needs to hire workers to expedite the gathering of her products.  Her products are normally sold at the collection centers in her community.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy cacao plants that she will eventually reintroduce so that she can take advantage of the short planting season.  Her plans for the future include buying additional farmland and growing citrus fruits.  This is her third loan with MFP.

Juntos residen en la  selva tropical peruana, ubicada en la comunidad de Sirenachayocc anexo del distrito de Quimbiri, donde tienen su techo propio construido a base de madera y techo de calamina. Debido a la crisis nacional que aquejaba nuestro pa\u00eds en los a\u00f1os 80, la familia de Maximiliana estaba a punto de sucumbir, su fuente principal era la actividad agr\u00edcola, pero ante los cierres constantes de las  carreteras no  pudieron vender ninguno de sus productos, y todo lo invertido se convirti\u00f3 en deudas para su familia. Maximiliana con apenas 09 a\u00f1os se daba cuenta de las penurias que pasaban en esa \u00e9poca. Hoy es una mujer bien centrada y responsable de sus actividades y junto con su esposo se dedican a labrar la tierra; en su parcela tienen sembrios de plantas de caf\u00e9 y cacao. Viene trabajando 18 a\u00f1os en sus propias tierras, En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos y de la mano de los jornaleros  para  as\u00ed avanzar con mayor  rapidez con las extracciones de los frutos. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos.

They live together in the tropical Peruvian jungle in the Sirenachayocc community, an annex of the Quimbiri district.  They have their own house, which is built from a wood foundation and a tin roof.\r\n\r\nDue to the national crisis that affected our country in the 80\u2019s, Maximiliana\u2019s family was at the point of succumbing.  Her main source of income was the farming, but after the constant road closings they could not sell any of their products.  Everything they had invested turned into debt for her family.  At just nine years of age Maximiliana realized the hardships that occurred during this time.  \r\n\r\nNow she is a well-centered woman who is responsible with her business activities.  She works the land with her husband.  They grow coffee and cacao plants on their plot of land.  She has been working on her land for 18 years.  During the harvest season she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is harvesting the fruits of the plants.  She feels that the months of hard work are compensated by the quality of her fruits. She considers the most difficult part of her job to be transporting her products from the farm to the distribution centers in the city of San Francisco.  That is where they offer better prices for her grains.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to improve her products.  Also, in the future she longs to expand her cacao plantings because she has two hectares of land.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue making her payments on time.  She is very pleased to be working with her communal bank.  She will use the requested 3,000 soles to buy natural and chemical fertilizers in order to improve her production.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":735721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy natural and chemical fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-22T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":248.08},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":261.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":269},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":283.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":303.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":316.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":330.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":343.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":352.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.96,"local_amount":248.08,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":251.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196410,"comment":null},{"amount":96.05,"local_amount":261.96,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":265.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270091,"comment":null},{"amount":98.64,"local_amount":269,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":273.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550109,"comment":null},{"amount":103.77,"local_amount":283.02,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":287.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718784,"comment":null},{"amount":106.94,"local_amount":291.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":296,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350241,"comment":null},{"amount":111.32,"local_amount":303.6,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":308.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850729,"comment":null},{"amount":115.88,"local_amount":316.05,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":320.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665923,"comment":null},{"amount":121.14,"local_amount":330.39,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":335.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621085,"comment":null},{"amount":125.95,"local_amount":343.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":348.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835287,"comment":null},{"amount":129.35,"local_amount":352.76,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":358.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245058,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T23:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283856,"name":"Joaquina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Jessie, who is 41 years old, works abroad to earn his living.  They have two children who are between 2 and 6 years old. Angie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Ruffa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruffa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.
