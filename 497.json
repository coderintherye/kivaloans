He was introduced to KADET LTD by a credit officer, and this is his first loan.  He plans to use the loan to purchase animal feeds (e.g., maize jam and dairy meal) and animal insecticides.  With the anticipated profits from the business, he intends to expand his dairy farming business and begin poultry farming.\n\nPatrick was away on a business trip at the time his profile details were being gathered and thus we have featured the wife in the photo.

is 34-year-old Sita T.. She is married and has two children, aged 16 and 7. In 2009, she established a vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for her farm.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sita plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. Over 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner, MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW was Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

In the future, Kalpana plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory stocked and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has five children, aged 19, 18, 16, 14 and 11. In 2000, she established her dairy business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase a young dairy cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sanam plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about ten liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women (Patan BPW). Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. It operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

In the future, Jayanti plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seed and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has 3 children aged 20, 18, and 13.  In 2009, she established  her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 6 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for her business.  In the future, Thikaymai plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

is 30-year-old Junita T..  She is married and has 2 children, aged 11 and 4.  In 2007, she established  her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent loan to buys seeds and fertilizer for her farming.  In the future, Junita plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Working seven days a week and eleven hours a day, he earns about $150 every month from his business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL in order to buy more lumber. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately $300. In the future, Farrah plans to produce more quality products as the demand for his products is very high. He also hopes to buy more working tools, as he wants to train some younger workers. He is serious and determined and thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":642555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy more lumber ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2010-11-18T12:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farrah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-18T09:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188635380,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378289,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195796232,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T07:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201881775,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206104708,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211175087,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:38:41Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216457871,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":210000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":214462.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221796652,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":390000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":398287.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991046,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":306375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232750190,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-18T19:31:52Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:27:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":249218,"name":"Lisbeth Carina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLOS LIDERES\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

The school is staffed with 7 teachers and 200 pupils.    \n\nThese hard working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 5,300,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful projects that they cannot do with their mere salaries alone. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials or a piece of land, to pay school fees for their children, or to invest the loan in a business. \n\nDavid B. is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in Waterloo, David is married to a businesswoman and the couple has six children, three of whom are attending primary and secondary schools respectively.  Mr. B., who has been in the teaching profession for 11 years, is requesting this loan in order to buy house-building materials. He began constructing a house for his family but ran short of building materials to complete the building project. With the help of this loan, he will be able to buy the remaining materials needed to finish the construction. \n\n(Attached to this photo is a snapshot of a borrower who was not able to be present for the group photo).\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":642630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy materials to finish building his house ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T10:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed R.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5300000,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":530000},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":530000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":260,"local_amount":1060000,"processed_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1062100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747898,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191486091,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912969,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T08:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201953009,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206572411,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211297119,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217134461,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746719,"comment":null},{"amount":130,"local_amount":530000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T08:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":531050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227719492,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T18:47:33Z","paid_date":"2011-09-20T08:11:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":249225,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 60-year-old Hawa.

In the future she\u2019d like to acquire a small house in the city so that she can get around more easily in order to sell all of her produce; she would also no longer have the problem of being stuck without transportation to return home.\n\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she is satisfied with the work of her communal bank where she has been working diligently for two years; she is sure of much future success.\n\nShe will use the loan to get four sack of organic manure, which cost 150 soles each, that she plans to spread among her pineapple plants that she will harvest these coming months.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":642643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 4 sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerardina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549500,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T17:16:17Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":249232,"name":"Gricelda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLOS LIDERES\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

But being aware of the needs of her children, and to give them a better quality of life, she plans to set up a small space in her house where she is thinking of opening a grocery store so that she can have better earnings.

This is Flor's 3rd loan, and she feels happy about the support being provided.

They have 2 children, \u00c1ngelo is 4 and Kenyi is 2 years old. The four live in their own home located in the city of Pichanaki (central Peruvian jungle). Since he was a child, Richard has been involved in agriculture but 8 years ago he got his own land, he grows coffee and other fruits native to the area and after harvest season he sells them in the central market of the city. What he enjoys most is the countryside where the demand for his products is greater and as a result the sale price increases. Richard takes advantage of this season to buy and sell products wholesale since they are sold in different cities of the country which gives him more income.

association of entrepreneurs that has existed for 9 years. The 9 women members of this group live and work on the island of Chira, located in the province of Puntarenas, on the pacific coast of Costa Rica. The women know one another on a deep and personal level, having lived in the same community for the majority of their lives. Throughout the group\u2019s existence, the members have received support and instruction from various public and private institutions, including universities and government bodies in charge of economic development. This will be the group\u00b4s second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. During the group\u00b4s first loan, the members demonstrated their ability to make punctual repayments and work well together as a group.   \r\n\r\nThe members of this group have a business producing various arts and crafts which they sell to tourists as well as locals at various fairs and sales events. The women work from 10 am to 4pm from Monday to Saturday. The work is separated into shifts, allocating some members to production and other members to sales, adjusting to supply and demand as the members see fit.  \r\n\r\nOn the production side, members work in their workshop in order to produce jewelry made out of fruit seeds, rock paintings, and gourd crafts (a gourd is called a Jicara in Spanish, a type of inedible fruit, which the women hollow out and paint, as can be seen in the picture). The gourd fruits are cultivated from the land of the members. \r\n\r\nOn the sales side of things, the women have been successful in earning revenues at various fairs and community events. Additionally, the association has secured an agreement with a local hotel owner who gives tours to her guests.  One stop on the tour is the workshop of the association, whereby observers can view the artistic production process and purchase hand made arts and crafts.  The group members are well aware of the marketing appeal that is generated by having visitors to their workshop; for this reason, one of the groups goals is to use this loan to make improvements to their workplace and make it more presentable, one woman explained, \"the workshop is the face of our business.\"   This loan will also be used to invest in work materials and tools, necessary for the production of various arts and crafts, including pliers, ropes, wires and wood.\r\n \r\nAdilia Maria E. M. is a 29 year old single mother who lives with her mother and 5 children on the island of Chira. Adilia, like the rest of the entrepreneurs in this group, is dedicated to her productive activity.  The revenues earned by these hard working women represents a significant portion of family income.  The main obstacle the members face is securing a steady market for their products.  At the moment, sales are sporadic, in good months, the 9 members can earn up to $1,000 as a group, in bad months, only $400.  Currently, the group is awaiting the response for an application that has been submitted to the municipality of Puntarenas, which would grant them the right to make sales to tourists on cruise ships.  Various cruise ships dock in Puntarenas, and this represents an interesting opportunity for the group to increase their revenues.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2088.87,"image":{"id":642716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To

Iman came to FATEN and took a loan for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIman's husband Sha'ban appear in the picture here because Iman comes from a very religious family. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n \r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a young mother of three sons and five daughters. Her husband is a National Palestinian Authority employee. Fatima wanted to help her husband support their big family and also fill her free time when her children are in school, so Fatima started selling clothes almost a year ago in her house.\r\n\r\nFatima came to Kiva's partner, FATEN, and borrowed a loan to purchase a large amount of clothing to sell and increase the store's returns as she became well-known in the area and more women visited her house to buy kids' clothing.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows Fatima in her house.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has never sat back and waited for things, she has always gone out in search of them.  She really enjoys sharing with others.\r\n\r\nGenoveva is very excited to be receiving her loan from Esperanza Internacional after having received an invitation to form part of the group in her community.  Here she has seen other hard-working women like herself manage to use their loans to gain capital for their businesses.  She is planing to relaunch her business since she had shut it through lack of capital.

is a 50-year-old man from Palestine, a father of four sons and two daughters. Ismael owns a sweets shop where he makes local sweets out of Semolina dough, cheese and sugar, such as Kunafa. Ismael started his shop three years ago.\r\n\r\nIsmael wanted to double his production due to an increase in demand and business prosperity, so he came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase sugar, coconut, nuts, cheese and fat. Ismael has long experience making local sweets and has a good number of clients.\r\n\r\nIsmael appears in the picture here in his shop.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Muhammad also works as a Palestinian National Authority employee. He started his workshop nine years ago.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is in a good location which attracts a lot of customers. Recently Raheefa's husband needed new efficient tools and car batteries. Raheefa came to FATEN and took a loan to help her husband purchase the mentioned items and have a better results and returns.\r\n\r\nRaheefa's husband appears in the picture here in the workshop as she is a religious woman and doesn't want her picture online.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene trabajando en sus cultivos, ya que puede disfrutar libremente de sus verdes campos, lleva 6 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cuidar sus cultivos de las plaga de insectos que pueden aquejarlas. Para el futuro, planea comprar nuevas tierras, con las cuales pueda incrementar sus cultivos.

For her there are no rest days since she has to continually work on her farm to achieve a good production.  The main products she grows are cacao, coffee and coca leaf which she sells wholesale in the town of San Francisco.  What she most likes about her work is the freedom that she has working with her crops since she can freely enjoy her green fields.  She has been in this business for 6 years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is dealing with insect infestations which can afflict her crops.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Ana plans to buy more land in order to increase her crops.  This is her third loan from MFP.  She has been very punctual in making her repayments and hopes to continue this.  She is very much liked by the other members of her community bank since she is a very happy person.  She will use the 2,000 nuevos soles she is requesting to buy cacao and coffee seeds.

Zuhair's son Ahmed wants to work after school and help his father, besides saving money for university tuition fees next year. \r\n\r\nZuhair took a loan from FATEN to purchase a motorcycle which a small carriage is attached to to use as a means of transportation in crowded places such as Gaza Strip where Zuhair and the family live.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It is composed of four women who are neighbours. Se\u00f1ora Mirella Espinoza Ram\u00edrez is planning to use her loan to buy insecticide to put on her nopal (prickly pear cactus) field. Se\u00f1ora Caritina Ray\u00f3n F. will use her loan to buy baby clothing, outfits, shirts, pants, towels, and stationery for her store. Se\u00f1ora Alicia H. A. will buy insecticide to put on her nopal field. Se\u00f1ora Carolina A. Ray\u00f3n will also buy insecticide spray for her nopal field.\r\n\r\nAlicia is the group\u2019s representative. She is 26 years old and has completed the third year of high school. She has three children, Fredy aged 7, who is in second year of primary school; Mar\u00eda Fernanda aged 5 and Paola aged 4 who are both in pre-school. Alicia is asking for a loan to buy fertilizer and insecticide for her nopal crop. As a young girl, her parents used to take her and her seven siblings to the countryside where she weeded the nopal plants with a special hoe.\r\n\r\nShe inherited the farm from her parents. It is located about a half hour from her house, in the countryside around Tlalnepantla, and she gets there either by car or by walking. Her business is important because it has to pay for all her expenses. When times are good and the price for her nopal crop is good, she manages to save some money. Her favourite part of the job is working there daily. She makes food to take there for her husband and the labourers who are working in the nopal fields, and she feels proud when her plants produce lots of nopal fruit because then the harvest is good and she has more money. The people who buy the fruit come from as far away as Milpa Alta, Mexico City, and Guadalajara.\r\n\r\nAlicia\u2019s biggest challenges are the insects which can attack the nopal fruit, and competition from other nopal growers. Sometimes there\u2019s a lot of nopal for sale at the same time. She plans to reinvest any profit in the business by spreading fertilizer a second time in the year. \r\n\r\nTlalnepantla is a quiet town where you can go out at night without worrying. There are many hills and you can see the volcano. It has a cold climate.\r\n\r\nThe farm provides financial support for the family and covers the cost of food and education for the children. Alicia wishes to renovate the house as it is still as her grandparents built it, and she wants to build on bedrooms for the children.

Bato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running an eggplant plantation.\r\n\r\nAlma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for the vegetables so she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Alma M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for his 13th loan, he is borrowing PHP 20,000, which he intends to use to purchase stocks of clothes to sell so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his business. \r\n\r\nArvin A. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gagantoca is a single woman who lives in Kenon Street, Brgy. 7, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a eatery ('carinderia') and a farming business. Candelaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Candelaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional working capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and put aside savings for future use. Candelaria Gagantoca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elvira has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty with her hard work. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to buy a new engine for a fishing boat. She plans to save up for future home repairs and business improvements. Elvira A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Sitio Bayon, Brgy. Paticui, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Genoveva is now borrowing PHP 29,000 in order to fund the operations of her plantation. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Genoveva hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Raya started to sell garden stuff at the local market and opened a sales location there. In 1998, in order to find a better place to live, she moved to Belovodskoe village where she continued her business in sales. Raya decided to sell ware and detergents and, owing to her wide experience in this activity, achieved success. With the revenues, she was able to buy a flat which was reconstructed as a grocery store. She bought goods and resold them by herself, without any help. Her shop became known for the good quality of the products and attentive customer service.\r\n<br>Now Raya wants to take a loan of 60,000 KGS to broaden the assortment of goods in her shop. It will allow her to raise floating capital and increase her number of customers.

L. is from the village of Poblacion, Dangcagan, Bukidnon.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling dried fish  including danggit, pinikas, and tamban, in the local community. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. The previous loan was used to to purchase additional dried fish to buy and sell. Fe is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. This loan will be Fe's second loan  from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.
