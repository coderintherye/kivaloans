She invested the loan that she received in buying shoes, sneakers, sandals, slippers, t-shirts, shirts, dresses, pants (trousers), etc.\r\n\r\nAlma Cristian's dream is to be able to grow her business a lot further as she would like to rent premises in which to set up her shoe store.  She would also like to save up so that she can guarantee her children's education.  She would like them to be able to continue studying and to have a good career.\r\n\r\nAlma Cristian thanks her lenders for helping people who work hard every day.  They are very entrepreneurial people and she says that they will repay the trust that the company is placing in them.\r\n\r\nThe members of this entrepreneurial group and their business activities are as follows:\r\nAlma Cristian - clothing store\r\nRosibell - clothing store\r\nYolanda - poultry store\r\nSara - perfume store\r\nDalia - craft store\r\nGloria - food sales"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1018927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to invest in buying shoes, sneakers, sandals, slippers, t-shirts, shirts, dresses, pants, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ometepe,Gro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":7400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alma Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosibell","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":95000,"loan_amount":7400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8245.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7907.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8406.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8686.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9196.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9540.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":9996.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10525.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10976.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":11519.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":642.26},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":615.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":654.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":676.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":716.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":743.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":819.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":855.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":897.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T04:54:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399490,"name":"Maria Bertha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene 2 hijos, cuentan con casa propia la cual esta ubicada en un caser\u00edo rural de nombre \u201cHuascar\u201d en la provincia de Tambogrande a m\u00e1s de cuatro horas de la Ciudad de Chiclayo, en su caser\u00edo normalmente se dedican a la crianza y agricultura como actividad econ\u00f3mica.\n\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica que desarrolla Maria es dedicarse a la crianza, engorde y comercializaci\u00f3n de animales menores como ovinos, porcinos, y aves de corral, para lo cual a instalado lugares apropiados para la crianza de los mismos, y los alimenta diariamente con pastos naturales y alimentos balanceados.\n\nEntre su esposo y ella siempre ha habido un compromiso de trabajo diario para la manutenci\u00f3n de su familia, hoy est\u00e1n solicitando un cr\u00e9dito a Edpyme Alternativa por un monto de 2500 Nuevos Soles los cuales destinar\u00e1 para la compra de alimentos balanceados, con el fin de darles un mejor engorde y un m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido crecimiento a sus animales para ponerlos a mejor precio, y con las utilidades generadas poder cumplir con su compromiso de pago y con obligaciones familiares.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 57 years old.

With this   loan, he plans to achieve an average monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which will allow him to bolster his working capital, honor his obligations to Soro Yiriwaso and provide for some family needs. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1029406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing [for resale].","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T15:06:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399056,"name":"Reymundo Ricardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reymundo hombre trabajador, comerciante sus proyectos es ir cambiando poco a poco la infraestructura de su vivienda, con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior invirti\u00f3 en la reposici\u00f3n del techo.

The loan she got will be invested in the purchase of chilies, tomatoes, onions, green beans, potatoes, carrots, lettuce, avocadoes, chayotes, apples, melons, papaya, peaches, oranges, grapes, etc. to have her stand better stocked.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Flor (as she\u2019s better known in her community) says that her goal is to cause her business to grow businesswise because she wants to build a locale to install her fruit store in and also to have it well stocked with more variety of products to thus obtain more and better profits.\r\n\r\nShe thanks FRAC and Kiva lenders for giving her the opportunity and for their trust but above all for believing in her because thanks to their support she was able to invest in her business and have a better quality of life alongside her family and a better future.\r\n\r\nThe other people who make up the Virgen del Carmen group are the following: Filadelfo, Faustina, Blanca Flor, Marciana and Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n who work in a variety of occupations like taxi driver, shoe store, fruit and vegetable sales, flower shop and grocery store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1019047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"va a invertir en la compra de chiles, jitomates, cebollas, ejotes, papas, zanahorias, lechugas, aguacate, chayotes, manzanas, melones, papayas, duraznos, naranjas, uvas, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Luis Acatlan,Gro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Filadelfo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4443.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4544.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4784.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4990.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5236.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":409.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T20:44:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400355,"name":"Najma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Najma is a married woman.

Single, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMariam operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and prepare food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMariam dreams to grow her business in the future.

This business is his main source of income and has allowed him to provide his family's daily bread. His main desire is for his family to have life opportunities different from those he has had. For this reason, he works hard to get his beloved family ahead. He is hard-working, dedicated, and, above all, responsible. This has allowed him to gain the confidence of his neighbours, who like his business more every day. All of this has led him to the decision to request this loan from INTEGRAL to invest in his sewing workshop through the purchase of the necessary basic material (fabric, buttons, elastic, ribbon, thread, etc). This will allow him to serve a higher demand, thus improving his sales levels. This will then allow him to reach his dream of providing his family with a better quality of life.

Her business is very accessible and highly frequented. Marta is very enterprising, so she is always looking for ways to grow her business. Her goal is to be able to meet the demands of a larger market, which is why she has decided to invest in her business so she can increase her sales and profits to improve her quality of life. All of this has brought her to request a loan from Kiva partner Integral, because she doesn't have sufficient funds to invest on her own. She will invest the loan in the purchase of necessary products like corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergent, drinks and other items, so she can make her delicious tortillas and sell the different items in her store. She is confident that with her work and God's help she will be able to achieve her dream of giving her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1019308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergents, drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T14:02:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400514,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is 49 years old and married with 2 children.
