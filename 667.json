International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also takes care of three relatives--those relatives also help on the housework. \r\n\r\nKadiatu has been in this business for three years and sells milk, packet water, sugar and sardines at her store. She also earns income from renting out a house.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Loma' (The Hill).  The group's members mention that when they set up their group, they held their meetings in a place which is located in the highest spot in their community.  This is why they decided to give the group this name.\r\n\r\nThe group has eight members and only one man.  Bertha, the group's representative, says \"this is the first time that I have been chosen as the group's representative but I am very keen for everybody to make their payments on time.  I am requesting this loan to invest in my business selling socks.  My mom brings them from PuebL. for me. I have an uncle there who makes them and I buy them from him.  It works for me because he gives them to me cheap.  On this occasion, I will buy socks, leg warmers, knee-high socks and ankle socks.  One of the challenges I face is when my neighbors don't want to pay me.  I go out to sell my products and I also sell them to the teachers in my daughters' school.  I sell them on credit.  I have been in business for approximately one year.  I hope that my business will do well and that I will be able to find a stable place where I can sell my socks and also sell other types of clothes\".\r\n\r\nBertha is 28 years old.  She has been married to Erasmo for 10 years and has two daughters.  Her eldest daughter is 9 years old and in the fourth year of elementary school.  Her youngest, Citlaly, is in pre-school.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group will invest their money in other things.  Julia will invest her money in sewing supplies and threads, MarceL. will buy chickens, Andrea will buy lambs, Margarita will buy lambs, Roberto will invest in his store, AngeL. will invest in clothes and Juana will invest in lambs.  In general, all the members of the group are happy with the loan that they are receiving.\r\n\r\n* Marce is missing from the photo.

She also says that she \"never loses\", because when the price of peas is low in the market, she dries the grain and sells it as a seed. This makes an earning of a little more than the invested money, since each bag of peas hovers around a minimum price of 500 soles. Her main difficulty is not having her own land, and having to pay for her children's studies. So, she plans to save at every opportunity in order to be able to buy more agricultural lands, thus minimizing the costs of leasing. She now plans to venture into sowing potato this season.

She is currently a member of the communal bank \u201cLas Pioneras\u201d (The Pioneers), which is maD. up of 7 members who make their livings in diverse commercial activities.  For the last 6 years, Deysi has run a small grocer's store located in her home.  Her business came about when her children started to go to school.  Deysi knew that she needed more income to cover the cost of their education and the cost of food and utilities.  She had some capital and invested it in the purchase of supplies like rice, milk, sodas etc.  With time, her business grew.  Deysi tells us that everything she has achieved has been through hard work and support from her husband.

He takes care of his father Juan, his mother Doris, and his 5 siblings in his house located in the town of Bellavista Huaracayo.  As the eldest son, he financially supports his parents.  For this reason, as soon as he reached adulthood, he began to work for himself.  His parents needed his help with farming, their main source of income.  Since then, they gave him land where he began to plant peas.  What he likes most about his work is harvest time, because he sees the reward for the arduous work that he does.  Moreover, he tells us that he plants on a small scale because during the coffee harvest, he travels to work as a laborer in various coffee plantations.  \"I have to work in various places in order to be able to save money; I'm a thousand positions (a jack of all trades)\" he mentions.  His greatest desire is to become a great farmer and sow extensive hectars of land.  For this, he works without rest, patiently awaiting the moment in which he can invest with his own capital.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d and this is his second loan with MFP, where he feels grateful for the opportunity he's been given.

Ahora que tiene mayores ingresos, desea mejorar la calidad de vida de ella y de sus hijos, por ello su primordial meta es arreglar la infraestructura de su casa. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPioneros de Capelo\u201d y este es el primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera del apoyo financiero de todos ustedes, para lograr sus objetivos. Adem\u00e1s promete ser puntual con el pago de sus cuotas.  Carmen cada 6 meses arregla las m\u00e1quinas que posee para el lavado; por ello de recibir su apoyo, invertir\u00e1 el dinero solicitado en pagar el mantenimiento de las mismas, con el cambio de motor y bomba de agua. \n\n","en":"Carmen, 33, is a happy woman. For 11 years she has lived with her husband, Sajid. Together they have 2 sons, Erick and Joel, whom they take care of in their own home in the city of La Merced in the central forest of Peru. With her future and development in mind, this talented woman opened a laundromat  8 years ago where she offers washing, drying and ironing services for different garments. She works Monday to Saturday along with her niece. They work hard in order to earn more money each day - \"this is my goal,\" says Carmen. Even though there are days when she doesn't have a lot of customers, she doesn't let it get her down. According to her accounts she earns 160 nuevos soles a day, which she uses to pay her staff, since delivery time is the most important. She also gets financial support from her husband who works as a manager of 2 television channels where he incorporates local ads and also does editing and taping himself. Now that she has more income, she wants to improve the quality of life for herself and her children. Her top priority is to make improvements to the house. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the village bank \"Pioneros de Capelo\" and this is her first loan from MFP. She hopes to have all of her financial support in order to meet her objectives. She promises to make her payments punctually. Every 6 months Carmen fixes her washing machines. She will invest the requested loan in paying for maintenance, changing the motor and the water pump.

They have two adult children who live independently.  The couple lives in their own house in the city of La Merced (Peruvian central forest).  The strength and seriousness that he projects are the pillars of his progress.  From a very early age he began carving out his and his family's future.  Every day for 22 years Pedro's restaurant, which is located in the city market, has opened its doors to offer delicious creole and typical local dishes.  According to his wife, Olivia, they have a wonderful flavor.  \r\n\r\nHis dedication to his children is what encouraged him to get ahead and continue working so hard.  Even though they are no longer living with him, he is very proud to see how they have progressed and become independent.  Therefore he is planning to invest in a room rental business.

Just three years ago she separated from her husband but she is a responsible mother and still cares for her two children: Kainer and Roc\u00edo.  Since the separation, they have become a very united family.  They live in her mother's house which is located in the town of Casacoto.  When she lived with her husband, Maribel had a small stall in Tarma central market.  There she sold vegetables to the local people who visited the market.  However, financial instability reached her household as a result of her separation and Maribel decided to start working in agriculture.  With the support of her mother, she set herself up in the village and started growing potatoes and corn.  Her produce is very good quality and, with every harvest that she obtains, she can see her efforts rewarded.  Maribel travels constantly to the capital city where she negotiates the sale of her produce for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the tireless hard worker that she is, Maribel also sells hamburgers on the corner outside her home on Saturday and Sunday evenings.  Every day she thanks God for the support that he gives her.  She would like to continue growing crops in order to gain more experience.  Her main goal is to get her children ahead in life and, in spite of the fact that she has an illness in her eye, she does not lose heart.\r\n\r\nMaribel is a member of the 'Miraflores de Casacoto' community bank and this is her second loan from MFP.

Her time revolves around taking care of her crops, which she has worked very hard on for 26 years. The whole time she has been able to obtain good coffee beans, big and sweet. She has done the same with citrus and the inevitable annato seeds, which she recently started planting. What she likes the most about her job is being in contact with nature, because it makes her feel relaxed and calm. When it is time to harvest the oranges, she works as a laborer in different farms, where she earns extra money. She also has her husband's support. He works in public transport, covering the routes between Kivnaki and Cerro Picaflor, where he makes extra money. Her plans are to continue improving her crops in order to earn more every day.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife does not work; she is a homemaker and looks after the children.  Farhod is involved in growing agricultural crops and also buying and selling vegetables and fruits.  His previous loan from Imon International provided him with a good result.  He increased his turnover, gathered a good harvest and improved his quality of life.  Farhod wants to obtain a loan in the sum of $3000 for the purchase of mineral fertilizers, which would allow him to get a good harvest.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is hard for him to support his family alone, and he always needs help.  Ibod has been involved in growing agricultural crops and raising cattle for over 10 years.  Because he has such a large family, he needs to have a good income in order to provide for his children.  This is why he wants to expand his business and maximize his profits, so that his children could grow up in good conditions.  He wants to obtain a loan in the sum of $2500 for the purchase of seeds and replenishment of his working capital.

\n\n","en":"Burulkan was born in the village of Belovodsk (in the Moscow region of the Kyrgyz Republic) to a large low-income cattle-farming family (eleven kids).  After nine years at the village school she went to a construction vocational school for three years. Ever since she was a child Burulkan helped her parents around the house, looking after the younger children and tending the cattle.\r\n\r\nWhen she was twenty, Burulkan got married.  At first she and her husband lived with her parents in Belovodsk.  A year later their first son was born, and the year after that their second son.  In 1993, after saving up some money, Burulkan and her husband bought a house in the village of Petrovka (in the Moscow Region, seven km from Belovodsk) and got some milk-cows.  In 1996 their daughter was born. At that point they they had two milk cows and two steer.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 Burulkan and her husband sold the cattle and the house in Petrovka and bought a small home in the city of Kara-Balta.  Burulkan's husband landed a job as soccer coach at a kids' sports academy, where he works to this day.  At that time they had a calf and a steer. By and by the calf grew into a milk cow and they sold the steer so they could buy a calf.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 Burulkan sold off some of the cattle to marry off her eldest son. Now her son and his wife live and work in Russia and help out their parents financially while their son lives with Burulkan. Burulkan doesn't have any cattle for the time being because she and her husband built a new cinder block fence and put up new metal gates and a three-cow barn.  In order to grow their livestock business, Burulkan has requested a loan of 40,000KGS from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy some calves.\r\n\r\nIn the future Burulkan plans to improve the farm by getting more cattle and building a bigger barn.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When a customer orders a product, Lilibeth orders it from the company, and the customer is given one month to pay his or her bill. Her customers are her neighbors and people in her community.  Each week, she earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from sales.\r\n\r\nLilibeth plans to use this 10,000 PHP loan as up-front cash to fulfill orders for her customers. She hopes the loan will enable her to expand her business and boost her income. \r\n\r\nLilibeth faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":866898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other direct sales products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilibeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3523.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764625,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2819.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571746,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2819.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529296,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1409.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738516,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T18:11:35Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":334483,"name":"Maria Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 30 a\u00f1os es casada y tiene tres hijos los cuales tienen 12, 10 y 1 a\u00f1o de edad; vive con su familia en Atuntaqui.

When she was no longer able to continue with that business, she decided to use her customer base and start offering merchandise such as ladies', men's and children's underwear. At present, her biggest challenge is growing her business with working capital to respond to a new and growing clientele. That is the reason she turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy underwear on order to respond to her customers, who like to give these items to their boy and girlfriends, their family members and friends. Her goal is to increase her sales and widen the variety of products with new brands. While she works and strives to attain this goal, she has a profit margin of no less than 28%, an inventory turnover of 10 days. These indicators project success with with Kiva and her gradual and much wished for business growth."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":866342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy underwear to to fill orders.
