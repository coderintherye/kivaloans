After the training period was over, Jeneth continued to work at the place she was training in order to perfect her skills.

Four of them are married and one is single.  Teresa has completed four loan cycles with Friendship Bridge, and has used her loans to purchase linen, curtains, and ceramics.  She buys the merchandise in Tapachula or Hidalgo City.  She is a leader in the San Felipe Retalhuleu community. <p> Teresa is very thankful to the Institution for her loans and the support given to her and her friends which has maintained unity in her loan group.  The talks given to them are very useful and keep her motivated.  <p>Teresa lost her father at the age of 7 and her mother when she was 13.  After this she went to live with her oldest sister, aged 45.  She comes from a very big family and is the youngest of 12 siblings.  When she was 8 years old she began to work at a refreshment stand cleaning tables and glasses because she was very small.  The owner of the refreshment stand had to buy her a stool for her to reach the tables and do her work.  She worked there for 2 years.  One evening her older sister hit her so Teresa ran away from home.  The police looked for her and found her but the abuse continued.  A lady named Greys, with whom she later worked doing laundry and ironing, took her in, so she only slept at her sister's home.  Later a school principal took her into her care.  The principal provided her with room and board, clothes, and made sure she was able to stay in school.  In return she cleaned the principal's house.  This way she was able to complete the 6th grade of elementary school.  At age 16 she got married and her first child when she was 17.  She was a single mother for 6 years.  When she was 21 years old she married Hector and has had a happy life with him. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Ari Vilhjalmsson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTERESA RUTH D. Q.

Her husband, meanwhile, is self-employed as a motor-taxi driver and typically contributes his daily income to the family savings. One of this couple's children works at the nearby local garment factory, and the two others are enrolled in school. S. is asking for a $1000 loan to purchase a passenger cart to be attached to her husband's motorcycle and make it a tuk-tuk, a motorcycle taxi. She thinks this can make additional income.

The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste materials to various processing factories which in turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials.

She takes care of the 4 orphans of her eldest brother. <p>\r\nMs. K. has been in rice agriculture for 4 years and currently owns a small plot of land with palm trees (she uses the nuts to make red oil and other products.) She doesn\u2019t own her own plot of land for rice agriculture, so even though she does all of the work for 5 plots of rice, she is paid very low wages for sprouting the plants, planting them in the plots, weeding them and taking care of them for 4 months, and then harvesting them. Since she has almost no profit from all of her work, Ms. K. wants to buy land with other members of her solidarity group to divide amongst them.\r\n<p> Ms. K.'s group will purchase about 5-10 hectares so that each woman will have \u00bd a hectare to herself. She is a very responsible woman who has been trusted to take care of the local church, including all of its funds, and can therefore be trusted with a loan. She also supports her son while he is in medical school and she is hoping to one day be able to help him start his own practice.\r\n<p>\r\nHaving only completed elementary school, Ms. K. finds it very difficult to make enough money to care for her family. She lives in her father\u2019s house with her children and cannot afford to properly feed them. Two of the children are in school, 2 are apprentices, and one left his apprenticeship and is currently unemployed. Some days she eats only a very small amount of beans to last her through the whole day of hard labor and she buys corn on credit in order to help feed the children in her home. \r\n<p>Ms. K. cannot afford to pay for a doctor\u2019s visit or for the medicine from a pharmacy, so she is forced to buy unregulated medicine sold on the streets when someone is ill. She cannot even afford to purchase boots in order to work in the water-drenched rice fields filled with worms that bite at her legs, so she simply wraps her feet in cloth.  \r\n<p>\r\nMs. K. is a very trustworthy woman and this loan will help her to be able to make a more decent living and to better care for her family\u2019s
