Long Vanary has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT

Nou Chak has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-28T06:50:31Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9628,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Nancy would like to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":6,"posted_date":"2007-04-30T01:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-14T02:27:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T09:15:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-06T04:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22885,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-07-14T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-06T04:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31860,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-30T02:27:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9629,"name":"Kamila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kamila is a vulnerable person from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.

Neang Rida has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Yea Yea has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT

S. is a farmer from a rural town named Salitre. There, he has a small farm where grows rice and corn. Luis has four children, two of which are all grown up and independent. The other two work with Luis on his farm while living in homes of their own. Luis will use the loan in order to purchase fertilizer and buy seeds. He wants to make the investment primarily in rice seeds now that the rainy season is coming to an end and the lands are fertile. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":33384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase rice seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-29T05:42:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-15T12:51:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:46:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19616,"comment":"1er pago de asociaci\u00f2n resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T14:04:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26606,"comment":"2do pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:04:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36153,"comment":"3er pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:30:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47478,"comment":"4to pago resistencia"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59571,"comment":"5to pago resistencia"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-01T12:51:38Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9654,"name":"Tomas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Tomas S. is a farmer from a rural town outside of the big city of Guayaquil named Salitre.

The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":33385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-29T05:42:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-15T01:28:11Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:49:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19620,"comment":"2do pago de asociacion resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T14:09:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26610,"comment":"2do pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:08:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36157,"comment":"3er pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:32:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47482,"comment":"4to pago resistencia"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59575,"comment":"5to pago resistencia"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-01T01:28:11Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9655,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Virgina is part of the first Communal Bank formed by Mifex in the rural town of Salitre. On her farm she cultivates rice and corn with the help of her husband and some of the children she had who are now adults. She hopes that with the loan she will be able to directly invest in rice seeds and pesticides that will help keep the crop healthy. She is also hoping she can purchase chickens for her farm as a secondary source of income. She is pictured at the Mifex offices after filling out her application. <\/p>\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group.

All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":33424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To cultivate rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-07T04:38:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulegio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-21T20:31:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T22:53:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23070,"comment":"1er pago de asociaci\u00f3n Rosa de oro"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T16:37:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33116,"comment":"2do pago asoc rosa de oro"},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:32:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71900,"comment":"3er pago rosa de oro"},{"amount":418,"local_amount":418,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":418,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130705,"comment":"Este cr\u00e9dito del Eulogio procedi\u00f3 a cancelarlo con la cosecha del arroz , siendo uno de los deudores que a procedido a realizar su pago total, quedando algunos agricultores pendientes de pago por cuanto les falta cosechar o vender sus productos "}],"funded_date":"2007-05-07T20:31:04Z","paid_date":"2008-02-07T20:30:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9670,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonio is from the county of Baba, a rice-growing region on the Ecuadorian coast.

All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

Desde que nacio el y su familia han subsistido gracias al arroz. El ahora tiene una finca desde hace 30 a\u00f1os donde el tiene varias cuadras de arroz. El quiere invertir en trabajadores que le ayuden a sembrar, ya que no quiere usar la ayuda de hijo para que pueda seguir estudiando. El tiene dos hijos, uno de 11 y el otro de 28 a\u00f1os. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<b>English Translation:<\/b>\r\n<p>Translated by Nuria  Ruiz, Kiva  Voluteer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pedro was born  and raise  in Baba.  Since his  family  can remember  their worked  in the  rice fields. Since 30 years ago  Pedro  has a plot  of land where he  cultivates rice. He  is  requesting a loan  to  hire some  laborers that would  help him seed. He  has a son but  he  prefers he continues his  studies  rather than  work on  the fields. His  oldest is  28 years old and the youngest is  11.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":33467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Sembrar arroz","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-30T17:43:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-15T02:38:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T22:54:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23072,"comment":"1er Pago Asociaci\u00f3n Rosa de Oro"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T16:45:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33118,"comment":"2do pago asoc Rosa de Oro"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:32:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71899,"comment":"3er ago rosa de oro"},{"amount":323,"local_amount":323,"processed_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134850,"comment":"pago de cuota final"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-01T02:38:23Z","paid_date":"2008-02-13T19:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9685,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Raymundo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose Raymundo is a married man and works in marble and granite.

His  family has always  worked in the  rice fields  and industry in Baba. He  lives  with his    wife and five  children, two  of his  children are  from his  prior  partner. Wilson  is  been able  to  provide for his  family  thanks  to  the  rice and banana  production  of  his  plot  of land. He  is  requesting a loan  to buy pesticides and fertilizers  for  his  crops  and  to fix his  house. Right now  his  house is  made out  of bamboo and thus not very well suited for  rainy  season.   <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves.

All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown.

The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":33478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Sembrar Arroz","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-01T19:32:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-16T19:48:10Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-06-17T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23731,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":32856,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:15:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43530,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:15:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55496,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68341,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82459,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-02T19:48:10Z","paid_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9690,"name":"Agopito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Agapito es un se\u00f1or de mayor edad pero que sigue trabajando en sus tierras dado a las necesidades de la vida.

The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":33484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invertir en arroz en su finca\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-01T19:42:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-16T15:56:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-06-14T22:55:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23073,"comment":"1er pago de asociaci\u00f3n Rosa de Oro"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-07-19T20:33:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33681,"comment":"2do pago asoc rosa de oro"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:29:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71896,"comment":"3er pago asoc rosa de oro"},{"amount":198,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:25:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107740,"comment":"PAGO ROSA DE ORO"},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134851,"comment":"pago de cuota final"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-02T15:56:08Z","paid_date":"2008-02-13T19:55:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9692,"name":"Yous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yous C. is 45 years old living with her husband and 3 children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":34139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of seafood products (oysters, dried fish, shellfish, etc.) from local fishermen; storage and transport to market for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Ndiaye Ndiaye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.55 -16.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-29T21:48:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-13T04:28:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27568,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":9,"local_amount":9,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:13:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41464,"comment":null},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:12:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50209,"comment":null},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63349,"comment":null},{"amount":173,"local_amount":173,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80053,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93789,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106887,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136709,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170169,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197314,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224305,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-30T04:28:37Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9791,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario is 26 years old and very hardworking.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":34281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Bulk purchase of local products such as millet, dried seafood, palm oil, hand-woven mats and brooms, vegetables, etc.; storage and transportation to market for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Foundioune","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-03T14:46:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-18T02:34:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-06-10T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21977,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-10T09:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":30623,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":11,"local_amount":11,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:13:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50219,"comment":null},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63356,"comment":null},{"amount":184,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":184,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80057,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:27:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106857,"comment":null},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136689,"comment":null},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178288,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":205862,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-04T02:34:50Z","paid_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9800,"name":"Hy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hy Chanthorn is 46-year-old and a mother of 5 children who lives with her husband in Phnom Penh, Camboida.

This couple is striving to work almost day and night in their field plowing, cultivating, and fertilizing soil to grow more crops due to a great demand in the market. They hope to use a loan to purchase one horse and a cart in order to transport crops from their farm to the local market. In the future, they hope to save more money to buy one more plantation so they can grow a wider range of crops for an addtional income. Chan T. hopes one day she will have enough money to send her children to a local univesity.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":34513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in rice production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-05T22:58:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-20T23:00:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21449,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-104,"local_amount":-104,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T07:34:58Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":-104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27100,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:19:27Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40784,"comment":"2DO PAGO STA LUCIA"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:14:58Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45303,"comment":"3er pago centro agr\u00edcola sta lucia"},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:12:55Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99057,"comment":"6to pago sta lucia"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:54:57Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-29T01:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106817,"comment":"6to pago centro agricola sta lucia"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-06T23:00:09Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:54:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9836,"name":"Efren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Efren is a rice farmer from Santa Lucia, Ecuador.

lives with her parents on their farm. Her parents are too elderly to run and manage the operations of the lands so they have given the responsibilities to their daughter. With the guidance of her parents, Grey is planting rice on the lands and she is gaining much experience. She wants the loan because she needs to invest in seeds and fertilizer. She also wants to avoid borrowing from informal lenders because her parents have told her about the risks of their interest rates. She hopes she can save the profits from the land in order to start a family of her own some day. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> She is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":34517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To farm rice on her lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-07T20:28:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-22T05:17:56Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:16:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21451,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":-104,"local_amount":-104,"processed_date":"2007-06-30T07:07:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":-104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086,"comment":"This adjustment was made to compensate for an error with the previous payment posted."},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:11:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40770,"comment":"2DO PAGO STA LUCIA"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:04:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45289,"comment":"3er pago sta lucia\r\n"},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:03:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99043,"comment":"6to pago sta lucia"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106803,"comment":"6to pago centro agricola sta lucia"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-08T05:17:56Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9839,"name":"Kak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kak P. is 32 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

has been cooking shish-kabab for over 11 years.

Currently he works independently at a separate business site and has constant, regular clients. He cooks shish-kabab from several types of meat: beef, lamb and chicken. \r\n<p>\r\nHis family keeps livestock at home, which is a cheaper alternative to purchasing meat from others'.

is married with a 13-year-old daughter. She runs a business selling a variety of household items such as laundry soaps, hair spray, tooth paste, and shampoo. Presently, she has about $10,000 in inventory.  \r\n<p>\r\nSvitlana is an energetic and focused business owner with an enterprising spirit. She has been in this business for more than ten years. Svitlana loves challenges and has overcome many difficult situations with her business. Her perseverance and diligence have been keys to her success.  \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Svitlana is requesting a loan for $1,200 to re-supply her product inventory. She is in the process of constructing a new store and believes that the household items will continue to sell well and provide necessary funding to complete the store construction. Additional retail space in the new facility will allow her to increase sales even further and bring in more income. She is confident that the availability of lending services will facilitate the construction process and help her open the new store sooner. Svitlana\u2019s goal is to continue refining her business skills so that she can keep her venture growing and provide for the needs of her family.

is divorced and raises her 5-year-old daughter by herself.

Her store is well known in the town because it provides the best assortment of food items that can please any sweet-tooth. \r\n<p>\r\nOksana is a focused hard worker. She has been in this business for more than 5 years. Her motivation in life and in business is to be successful. Oksana has benefited greatly from the financial assistance she has received through Nadiya Ukraine, and she tells many people about the available lending services.\r\n<p>\r\nOksana is hoping to get a loan for $1,200 to buy some new equipment for her store. She believes that upgrading her facilities will help guarantee sustainability for her business and provide a stable income for her family.

Having to travel into Accra for spare parts is very time-consuming, and Kwame plans to use the $1,000 to purchase and maintain a parts inventory, reducing his time away from repairing vehicles and training his apprentices. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":34632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"The purchase of an inventory of spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"J & K Engineering","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":54,"posted_date":"2007-05-08T07:16:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justice Kwame","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-22T20:00:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-06-22T09:16:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":25389,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T09:17:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34380,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T09:17:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45272,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-09-22T09:21:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":57517,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T09:21:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70762,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85144,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-08T20:00:30Z","paid_date":"2007-11-22T10:25:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9874,"name":"Mar\u00eda Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. G. spends her time selling sheets and quilts, which she gets from various inner-Mexico cities. \"My business helps my husband with household expenses and my daughter with school.

is married with two grown children. She sells clothing items in one of the busiest markets in Ivano-Frankivsk. She owns three vending facilities and has three hired employees who work for her. The inventory she sells is of very high quality. Even though her prices are a little higher than average, Mariya has gained many loyal customers who keep coming back to buy clothes from her.  \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has been in business for 10 years. The twenty-four loans she has received and promptly repaid with Nadiya Ukraine have promoted consistent increase in her sales and profits. Currently, she has around $8,000 of working capital. Her net profit is about $2,000 every month. \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has requested a loan for $1,200 to help open her fourth vending kiosk and expand her trade as a result. Her daughter just had her first baby and Mariya is enjoying her responsibilities as a grandma.

is married and has two grown daughters. He runs a business selling men\u2019s clothing in the central city market. Reasonable prices for the clothing in Pyotr\u2019s kiosk are affordable to average Ukrainians and make it a desirable stop for many customers. Pyotr works in a highly competitive segment of the market. However, he offers a big assortment of inventory in comparison to other entrepreneurs involved in this sphere of trade. Athletic and casual wear, jackets and t-shirts are just some of the clothing items to be found in his kiosk. \r\n<p>\r\nPyotr has been in this business for 10 years. Previously he served in the military. His disciplined mind and the consistency, persistence, and determination he demonstrates have fueled the expansion of his business. His inventory is continuously growing and his profit margin is about 70%. \r\n<p>\r\nToday he is requesting a loan of $1,200 to purchase seasonal men\u2019s clothing for the coming months. Pyotr realizes the role that available lending services have had in the growth of his business. Financial assistance from Nadiya Ukraine has helped him generate income that he has used to complete the reconstruction of his apartment and install a heating system and help pay for his daughters\u2019 college education. Now Pyotr is planning to use part of his income to help his mother-in-law who owns a business in the same city market. Eventually he would also like to open a vending facility in the central city mall. We believe that his ability to make good decisions and set right goals will help him repay this loan promptly and will enable his business to continue to thrive in the future.

He lives with his wife, Cecilia, and his four children. His oldest son works with him on the farm to grow their products, while the other three still go to school. He is a native of Salitre and has been raised in agriculture his entire life. He also has a small butcher shop in the small town of Salitre. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to invest in feed for his cattle and possibly buy some more steers. With the profits he will continue to educate his kids and feed his family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy.

On his farm he cultivates rice and soy beans while also raising cattle. He and his wife work very diligently on the farm in order to feed their two kids who are 8 and 13 years old. His wife also makes cheese and sells milk produced from their cows. Primarily though, they sustain their family with their rice production as most people from the area do. They hope to invest in fertilizer and seeds in order to increase their crop output. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy.

He lives with his wife, his grandparents and his children. He has two kids, a 16-year-old son and an infant daughter. His son helps him on the farm while also going to school. He wants to use the loan to prepare his lands for the upcoming planting season. In the future, he wants to improve his home by making it out of cement, as it is currently out of wood and is not in the best condition. <\/p> \r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group.

Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances, they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season.

has been living on his ranch for over thirty years. There he has been able to cultivate rice and raise cattle in order to support his family. He has two sons who help him on the farm. One is 17 years old, and the other is 16. He also has a young 7-year-old daughter who is going  to school. He and his wife hope to make the necessary investments in rice that will ensure that the crop goes well, such as fertilizer and pesticides. With this crop cycle's extra profits, they hope to save enough money to make some improvements to their home. He is pictured with Esther from the Mifex staff. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserves for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-01T22:38:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:24:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31434,"comment":"1er pago asoc 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:29:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40408,"comment":"2do pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:39:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53262,"comment":"3er pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:36:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88536,"comment":"4to pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99032,"comment":"6to pago asoc 10 de enero"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-18T22:38:36Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10055,"name":"Oscar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Oscar has two children who live with him and his wife.

is a cattle rancher from Salitre. He wants to invest the money he receives from the loan in pesticides for rice and raising pigs. He commercializes the rice and pigs himself by traveling and selling to the nearby city of Milagro. He has one son who is in school. He wants to buy a truck in the future with the extra money he makes. He also hopes he can continue to provide an education for his 15 year old son. <\/p>\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farm rice and invest in pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-18T00:44:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T05:50:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:22:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31429,"comment":"1er pago asoc 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40403,"comment":"2do pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:48:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53269,"comment":"3er pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:17:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73628,"comment":"4to pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:33:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88531,"comment":"5to pago 10 de enero"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99027,"comment":"6to pago asoc 10 de enero"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T05:50:17Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10065,"name":"Fazila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fazila is 47 years old.

She hopes to invest the loan in buying rice from the local farmers so she can sell it to distributors. She has three children, two males and a female. She lives in her home with two of her kids who are still in school. She hopes that she can save enough money to send her kids to school in Guayaquil. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy rice wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T20:44:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-29T19:58:53Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:14:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29279,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n buena suerte\r\n"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T22:55:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40767,"comment":"2do pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:12:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53284,"comment":"3er pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T20:12:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89185,"comment":"4to pago buena suerte"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99040,"comment":"6to apgo asoc buena suerte"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-15T19:58:53Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10090,"name":"Nelson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Nelson lives on a farm that is owned by his father.

He wants to invest in fixing his lands because they are not in the best shape for rice cultivation. In the long run, he wants to save enough money to buy a truck. He lives with his wife and four children. Three of his sons work the lands with him. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andres is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T20:44:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-31T07:21:40Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:12:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29276,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T22:50:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40765,"comment":"2do pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:09:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53281,"comment":"3er pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T20:11:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89182,"comment":"4to pago buena suerte"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99038,"comment":"6to pago asoc buena suerte"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-17T07:21:40Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:49:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10095,"name":"Maria Elida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Maria Elida is married and has five children.

He will use the loan to invest in pesticides and fertilizer for the rice he has planted. He is divorced from his wife, but he is still very close to his daughter who is 7 years old. He pays for her education and still helps her out. He hopes to continue supporting his daughter and growing his business. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Fernando is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas. known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy). with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in his rice farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-16T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-31T17:42:56Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:13:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29278,"comment":"1er pago asociaci\u00f3n buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:11:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53283,"comment":"2do pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:22:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71895,"comment":"3er pago buena suerte"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T20:12:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89184,"comment":"4to pago buena suerte"},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135458,"comment":"pago de cuota final"}],"funded_date":"2007-05-17T17:42:56Z","paid_date":"2008-02-14T16:12:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":10098,"name":"Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelica is a 39 year old single mother of 4 children of ages 18, 19, 21, and 23 years of age.

He has been rice farming in the sector his entire life. He is also one of the main leaders of the rural associations there. He is hoping he can receive the loan in order to invest in his lands and buy feed for his livestock. F. is proud to receive these loans and be part of a communal bank he helped form. He is pictured with a tractor he rented to work his lands. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season.
