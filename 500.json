T. is a married woman who lives in Purok Magtalisay I, Brgy Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She operates two business ventures: fishing and buying & selling livestock. Her husband, Henry T., who is 28 years old, works as a fisherman and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children aged between 4 and 6. \r\n\r\nRengie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rengie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy some materials to repair her boat pump. Then she can continue to save additional capital for the business, to pay family expenses and build up savings. Rengie T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Julius L., who is 33 years old, works as a driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children aged 8 and 9. \r\n\r\nRowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,200, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her store and fish to sell. She can then continue to save for the future expansion of her business. Rowena L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have four children aged between 30 and 35. \r\n\r\nTessie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tessie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, thus lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000. She intends to use this to buy materials for her fishing boat so that she can continue to save for the future improvement of business. Tessie A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

M. is from the village of Burgos. He is 61 years old. Alfonso is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Alfonso owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Alfonso has been engaged in his business for over 30 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alfonso joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alfonso has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Alfonso is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Alfonso from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Letecia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Letecia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her husband Jonathan C., who is 41 years old, works as carpenter for a living.  They have 3 children, ages 11 to 18. <p>\r\n\r\nJerima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jerima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 34000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, with which she intends to purchase more stock to sell, so she can continue to save for house renovations in future. <p>\r\n\r\nJerima C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 42-year-old mother of three children whose futures she and her husband work hard to ensure. Maxima is thankful to ASHI for the loans it has provided since 1999 that have enabled her fishing operation to grow through the purchase of a motor boat, fishing net and other business-related materials. She is now requesting a new loan to purchase additional fishing nets and fish cages (traps) and hopes to increase the amount of fish she can sell in the future through hard work and the continuing assistance of  Kiva Partner ASHI. <p>\r\n\r\nMaxima's membership in ASHI  gave her the chance to have her own business. Because of her excellent credit performance throughout her membership in ASHI, from an initial loan of Php5,000 she can now avail Php40,000.00 and could even reach the peak amount available in the future.  Therefore, Maxima looks forward to continued business growth through both the loans and the help of her supportive husband, Mamerto, who is her business partner. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen she reaches the highest loan amount that ASHI can offer, she plans to rent a space in the market where she can sell their fish. With the opportunity provided by her membership in ASHI, Maxima can help send their three children to school until they complete college degrees. The couple believes that when they pass away, they will at least have made their business successful and their children can have a business. Maxima\u2019s hard work and patience are her foundation in working to achieve a better life for them.  <p>\r\n\r\nMaxima is very happy to be a Kiva borrower and says thank you for offering financial

2004, Rosemarie E. found an opportunity to acquire business capital. She joined ASHI and she was inspired by the stories of other poor women. \r\n\r\nShe wanted to become successful like them. Because of the opportunity to take out loans, Rosemarie was able to start a business she thought she could be successful at: fishing. \r\n\r\nShe is courageous enough to take all the risks of running this business because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream she keeps in her mind of  having all her children finish their schooling through college. \r\n\r\nRosemarie has kept on taking loans from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her new loan to buy equipment needed for her fishing business, such as a new boat, fishing nets and other supplies so that her husband will catch more fish to sell. If ever the couple gets better output, they will be able to invest more in their business and in their home.\r\n\r\nRosemarie's only hope is that her children not experience the hard life she and her husband experienced. She dreams of expanding her fishing business. Her long term goal is to build a new, spacious, concrete home to live in.\r\n   \r\nRosemarie and her husband help each other to achieve their dreams of offering a better life to their children. The couple says thank you to Kiva and ASHI for offering financial support to her business effort.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":431.25,"image":{"id":647512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

He is married to Leitato Sopia and he is a father of two school-going children. Fredrick is a businessman involved in the selling of livestock.\r\n\r\nHe learned about KADET from other members in a group already registered with KADET in his area of residence.

K., 27 years old, married and a father of six school-going children, has been a maize farmer in Narok area for the last four years. Maize normally does well in this area due to good climatic conditions, and he hopes that this will be true in the next planting season as well.<p>\r\n\r\nMeiponyi learned about KADET from other members in a group already registered with KADET in his area of residence.

is 25 years old and married to Tabitha Wanjiru. He sells secondhand clothes as well as new clothes for men. The clothes range from shirts and trousers, which are both official (business) and casual wear.

She lives with her husband and two children in a place in Perimetral de Guayaquil, an area which is surrounded by a salt marsh.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Gladys has always liked to help people to improve their lives.  When she started university she decided to specialize in gynecology.  She didn't just want to become a doctor but also wanted to help people where she lived who couldn't afford medical treatment.  She set up her business in \u201cBasti\u00f3n Popular\u201d, providing nursing and gynecological services at very affordable prices.  She currently provides her services as a doctor in premises which are located in her own home and in the \u201cBasti\u00f3n\u201d area.  She also helps women who want to improve themselves and haven't had the opportunity to study, teaching them to perform medical check-ups and plan their family lives.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue helping women, she would like to use her loan to buy nursing and gynecological materials.  In the future, she would like to open a new doctor's office in the south of the city since that is where most people who haven't had the opportunity to improve themselves live."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":647893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical Clinic","sector":"Health","use":"To buy nursing and gynecological materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-11-22T17:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":74.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":108.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.26},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.51},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.49},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.08,"local_amount":63.08,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681464,"comment":null},{"amount":74.26,"local_amount":74.26,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":74.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379778,"comment":null},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":75.98,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797775,"comment":null},{"amount":79.51,"local_amount":79.51,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":79.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239929,"comment":null},{"amount":79.59,"local_amount":79.59,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":79.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206106370,"comment":null},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":81.9,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":81.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211863124,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459601,"comment":null},{"amount":85.61,"local_amount":85.61,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":85.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221623446,"comment":null},{"amount":87.25,"local_amount":87.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":87.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992710,"comment":null},{"amount":180.76,"local_amount":180.76,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":180.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555957,"comment":null},{"amount":108.73,"local_amount":108.73,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":108.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250723555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-22T20:54:27Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:32:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":250822,"name":"Luz Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROGRESO\u201d;

Currently, he goes out at dawn to fish and returns in the morning to sell fish at $2.50 a pound and shrimp at $4.00 a pound.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy nets and propellers for his canoe to fish more easily.

A short decade later, after her father attended a \u201cHolistic Resource Management\u201d workshop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, her parents were inspired to \u201cactively participate in the creation of a sustainable, ranching culture.\u201d  Her father is a certified Holistic Resource Management Instructor and he holds workshops for sustainable ranching methods to ranchers in the Sonora Desert area. Aside from the cattle ranch, her parents also make mesquite lump charcoal. They prune the mesquite trees to help them grow and they use the pruned mesquite branches in four ways: they lay the brush on the ground to catch the sparse and precious water, they manufacture beautiful wood tiles, cutting boards, and wood flooring, they grind mesquite beans to make a healthy powder meal called Pechita, and lastly, they burn the mesquite in an underground pit to create mesquite lump charcoal.\r\n\r\nDacia\u2019s parents have been manufacturing the mesquite lump charcoal for years and distributing the product to different buyers in Mexico. They discovered that buyers in Mexico were selling their charcoal for a much higher price to people in the U.S. This was the incentive for Dacia to start her own business in the U.S. to sell directly to U.S. consumers. With Dacia being a recent graduate from the University of Texas in El Paso this past May with a degree in Marketing and Management, she is now ready to market and sell the product in the U.S. This past summer, she created her own business with a separate name than her parents\u2019, Lumbre. \r\n\r\nDacia will use this loan for operating expenses and buying more mesquite charcoal from her parents. Dacia says that if she had not received a loan, she \u201cwould have been stalled. ACCION Texas-Louisiana really helped my business move forward.\u201d Since graduation, Dacia has been dedicating her time to marketing the product to restaurants and stores in El Paso. She is also trying to find big buyers in Colorado and California who would be interested in the green and sustainable processes her family uses to create this product.  \r\n\r\nDacia says that the process of applying for a loan really helped her because it gave her time to realize what her actual costs were and where she should allocate her loan. \r\n\r\nA challenge for Dacia is that people claim that the process of making charcoal is harmful because it emits smoke, which contaminates the air. Dacia argues that people buy charcoal regardless and that their ranch utilizes the pruned branches of mesquite in a sustainable way. \r\n\r\nEventually, Dacia would like to see Lumbre\u2019s mesquite lump charcoal in the grocery store right next to Kingsford charcoal. \r\n\r\nFeel free to check out Dacia\u2019s website at

There, in spite of being in an administrative position, he learned all the techniques and stages of the production process.

His workshop, although it is small, has an industrial sewing machine and all the manual equipment he needs to produce any type of footwear.  Normally Edgardo works alone but in the end-of-year season his orders usually increase considerably and he hires an assistant who helps him cut his synthetic material and leather.\n\nThis is Edgardo's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

For the last ten years this hard-working man has worked making small brake parts for cars in the peace of his own home.  He works all day long and is able to set his own schedule.  He is proud to say that he is very happy with his work as with time he has been able to buy the best specialty machines for making these brake parts which allows him to do good work in less time than before.  Although he works alone, he doesn\u2019t lack customers that require these metal parts as near his workshop there is a mechanic.  What he does not like is that often he must go out looking for materials and leave the taller alone so that he loses customers.  Additionally, the regular income from his business allows him to live comfortably and offer a better quality of life to his daughter.  As he is an enterprising man, in the future he would like to improve his business to offer improvements to his customers.  This is the first loan that he has requested with MFP and he promises to make his payments punctually so as to not look bad to the people who made this contribution possible so that he can continue to work and look for ways to make progress.  Willy plans to invest the loan he is requesting in the purchase of materials to make these brake parts and to complete an outstanding order that he hopes to complete to improve his income and get ahead. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":648295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase materials to make small car parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-23T03:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":227.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":237.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":244.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":256.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":262.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":271.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.49},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.49,"local_amount":227.69,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":234.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725411,"comment":null},{"amount":87.06,"local_amount":237.44,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":244.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463509,"comment":null},{"amount":89.66,"local_amount":244.52,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":251.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886892,"comment":null},{"amount":93.92,"local_amount":256.17,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":263.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327245,"comment":null},{"amount":96.31,"local_amount":262.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":270.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195815,"comment":null},{"amount":99.56,"local_amount":271.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":279.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269478,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-23T12:25:16Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":250942,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda S. is from the village of Guba, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

S. (PK-00251) is a 42-year-old male living in the town of Pejarakan - Singaraja, Indonesia.  He is married and has one infant child.  To make a living, Budi owns & operates a business making & selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Budi has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Budi joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Budi is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. Budi is now requesting a new loan of 2,500,000 IDR, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by the borrower from MUK.  Budi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBudi S. (PK-00251) merupakan 42 tahun pria.  Dia (laki-laki) tinggal di kota Pejarakan - Singaraja - Bali.  Dia (laki-laki) menikah dan memiliki 1 anak usia balita.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Budi memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pangan.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah membuat & menjual makanan.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual makanan ringan & makanan kecil lainnya di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Budi sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 6 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Budi menghasilkan sekitar 500.000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Budi bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Budi telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (laki-laki) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2.500.000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli inventaris & modal kerja tambahan.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Budi berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk mendukung keuangan anggota keluarga langsung peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \"\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":648438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional inventory & working capital\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-11-23T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Budi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":206500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188717132,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191455974,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878570,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319866,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189231,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262854,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542792,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711301,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081727,"comment":null},{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":623500,"processed_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":667095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609598,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-23T14:43:14Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:31:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":250976,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a 32-year-old creative man with three children living in a mud wattle house in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Susana is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Susana from HSPFI.

She lives there in the area named Shalimar with her family in a 2 room brick house. \r\nShe is divorced and does embroidery to earn a living for herself. Robina didn\u2019t want to become a burden on her brother and that\u2019s why she started embroidering clothes by receiving orders from her neighboring clients. She doesn\u2019t have any children. \r\nRobina's brother is involved in a business of selling toys. He sells different kinds of toys such as plastic and rubber toys to his customers. This is his main business which helps him to earn income for the family. \r\n\r\nRobina is very supportive lady in nature and always looking to help her family. That's why she has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her brother. He will invest the loan in purchasing toys in bulk .

A. is from the village of Minsapinit, Gingoog City. She is 42 years old. Myrna is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Myrna owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, junk foods, eggs, detergents & canned goods in the local community. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Myrna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory for sale & working capital. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Myrna from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ernesto only studied through 10th grade, and didn't continue due to financial difficulties. He helps support his parents and siblings  who live with him.\r\n\r\nErnesto continues to live in Namaacha and started a business raising hens to lay eggs, using funds that he obtained working in mukero (selling contraband goods). He keeps around 45 hens, producing 45 eggs per day and selling them for 5 Meticais each. He makes around 225 Meticais per day. His monthly earnings come to 6750 Meticais, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money each month in his bank account. Because of his dedication, he approached Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner] to ask for a loan to buy more hens. Because of the cost of feed his profits have been small, but he would like to start providing eggs wholesale to institutions and grocery stores \r\n\r\nThis is his 3rd loan with Hluvuku, for the amount of 10,000 Meticais. He plans to use this money to buy more laying hens. His earlier loans were for 25,000 and 40,000 Meticais and were used to buy and raise chicks.\r\n\r\nErnesto is confident that he will be able to repay the loan ahead of schedule and then request

M. is from the village of Minsapinit, Gingoog City. She is 32 years old. Ester is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Ester owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting  vegetables like camote tops & other leafy vegetables. Ester has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ester joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ester has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Ester is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ester from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is single and has no children. He only studied through 10th grade, and didn't continue due to financial difficulties. He lives in a rental house and pays 800 Meticais a month in rent. He helps to support his nephew who lives with him. \r\n\r\nDaniel left Zambezia for the district of Namaacha with his uncle, thinking that he would go to school there. After arriving in Namaacha he did continue with his studies, and finished 10th grade, but his schooling was interrupted when his uncle died. He then started his own business with the money he received after his uncle's death, intended to help him get by on his own. Today Daniel is the owner of two kiosks in the Mercado Central [Central Market] with merchandise valued at approximately 25,000 Meticais, thanks to his loans with Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner].  He works from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and his best selling products are telephone batteries and covers, and movies. He spends 8000 Meticais on average to purchase these items and makes a profit of 2500 Meticais per week. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some in his bank account. His nephew helps out by giving him around 1000 Meticais each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Daniel's 3rd loan, for the amount of 15,000 Meticais. He plans to use this money to buy cell phone batteries, DVDs and CDs, and other items, in order to increase his range of products. His earlier loans, for 5000 and 10,000 Meticais, were used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nDaniel is confident that he will be able to repay the loan ahead of schedule and take out a new loan to cover the legal fees needed for his

A. is from the village of Minsapinit, Gingoog City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling green bananas in the local community. Isabelita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Isabelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Isabelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional bananas to  buy and sell. Isabelita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Isabelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has 7 children ranging in age from 19 to 38 years old. Four of her children are working and 3 attend school. She lives in her own house and helps support her niece, who lives with her.\r\n\r\nCeleste moved from Manhi\u00e7a to the district of Namaacha with her husband, who was transferred there for work. She started a business selling meals in the barracks on the border with Swaziland; these were later closed by the government due to the pollution in the area. With the help of her neighbor, who did well raising poultry, she built a chicken coop by her house and started raising chickens. She has also become very successful with this venture. She's raised hundreds of chicks and has spent around 50,000 Meticais in doing so, while she can sell each chicken for 125 Meticais. She staggers the age of the chicks so that she always has mature chickens to sell. She sells most of her chickens wholesale, since she saves on feed that way, and she's made a profit of 12,500 Meticais. She also sells directly to local consumers, though her profit doing this is only 10,000 Meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nCeleste has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is her 5th loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy chicks, feed and vitamins in order to increase the number of chickens she can raise, as she want more chickens to sell during the coming holidays. Her earlier loans were for 10,000, 10,500 and 25,000 Meticais and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will be able to repay the loan ahead of schedule and take out new loan to buy a pushcart that will help her in her daily work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":648533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase

L. is a 49-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  Sari-sari (general) store and livestock businesses. She lives in Media Once, Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and livestock businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP16,000. Rosalia is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.\r\n\r\n Rosalia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is from the village of Minsapinit, Gingoog City. He is 30 years old. Menardo is married and has 3 very young children. To make a living, Menardo owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling green bananas & vegetables like squash and eggplants in the local community. Menardo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Menardo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Menardo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Menardo is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Menardo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a widow  who lives in  Brgy. San Antonio, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  retailing of Avon products and Ready-To-Wear clothes businesses. Melanie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy Avon products to sell to her neighbors so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business. \r\n\r\nMelanie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is also engaging in butchering pigs once a month. Nancy has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nancy joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nancy is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Nancy from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

He is 22 years old and is in a common law marriage. He has two children who are 2 and 4 years old and not in school. He went to school until 7th grade but didn't continue due to lack of financial resources to pay for boarding school for high school. The school was 30km away from his home. He lives in his own house and supports his mother and sister who live with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Matola to go to Namaacha when his father sold his land. He then started his commercial and fishing business. He owns a row boat and a store. He was able to own them with his income from selling fuel and with Hluvuku and Kiva's help. His best product is fish. He has two employees to help him and makes 10,000 meticais per month, depending on the season.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks. He heard about Hluvuku through friends who are also our partners. This loan, in the amount of 15,000 meticais, is his third. He will buy fishing nets to increase his inventory and please his clientele. The previous loans were for 10,000 and 5,000 meticais and were used in the same activity. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to start working and to request more loans to purchase another boat to increase his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":648549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of fishing nets and hooks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betuel Cardoso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":251031,"name":"Rhynna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhynna A. is from the village of Ricoro, Gingoog City.

He is in a common law marriage and is the father of a 2 year old. He is 35 years old. He went to school until the 10th grade and had to drop out because his job no longer allowed him to go to school. He supports his twin sister and his nephews by buying their school uniform and supplies every year.\r\n\r\nHe left his parents home when his older sister was given a house and asked him to take care of it. That same year his sister found him a job a the Libombos Hotel since she was an accountant there. In order to get that job he needed to at least complete 10th grade and he only had completed 8th grade by then. He went back to school and after finishing 10th grade started working as a receptionist, a position he still holds. He is a permanent employee, works from 7am to 7pm and makes 4,000 meticais. He spends his salary in household expenses and saves 500 meticais due to his finishing construction. \r\n\r\nThis loan, in the amount of 20,000 meticais, is Clem\u00eancio's fourth with Hluvuku. He intends to buy construction material (cement, sand, bricks and others). All four loans were for 20,000 meticais and used for the same goal. His goal is to see his construction finished and to request a new loan to furnish his house. He believes he will repay the loan ahead of time since he can count on his wife's help. She owns a beauty salon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":648570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

All of her children are attending school and getting their education. \r\n<p>\r\nRoohi Bano is a very kind and supportive person in nature. She supports her family financially by operating an embroidery business at home. She has a good number of clients in her neighbouring area who give her regular orders every month. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband also does embroidery, but the only difference is he makes embroidery designs with a sewing machine while she does the embroidery by hand. He operates a shop in the market where he offers embroidery services to his clients. \r\n<p>\r\nRoohi Bano has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to financially assist her husband in his business. With the loan, he will buy another embroidery machine and hire a worker who will help him finish the orders on time. Her husband has been doing this business for over 10 years and Roohi Bano is hopeful that a loan investment will take his business to a more profitable level. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah and hopes that it will be a profitable experience for her. \r\nNote: In the photo, the woman who is raising her hand is Roohi

She also sells clothes which suits the tastes of her neighbors and friends.\n\nBut life isn't all about business. Ma. Corazon sees in parallel the needs of her business as well as the needs of her children. Realizing that she needs more than what she can produce at the moment, she would like to apply for Php 38,000 loan. Ma. Corazon will use the money to buy merchandise in bulk for her business. She also intends to buy two computer units and start up a computer shop. \n\nShe aspires for her junk shop to grow, because in the end, it will benefit her family, especially her children.  She faithfully attends weekly fellowship* meeting.\n\nThe price of junk items has gone down, and that really poses a business challenge to Ma. Corazon, but she knows that all things eventually work out for the good of God's people. God never treats His children like trash, and neither does Ma. Corazon. She values her children so much, and her desire is  for them to finish schooling and serve God in their lives.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
