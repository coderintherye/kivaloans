She has 8 children; the eldest is 15 and the youngest is 2 years old. Estela understands the importance of providing for all her children, which is why she has a set goal of making her business grow into a successful cafeteria. \r\n\r\nEstela sells food (both uncooked and prepared). She cooks with charcoal because she doesn't have a stove, so part of this loan will be used to buy enough charcoal for her to cook the prepared meals she sells at her stand. The rest of her loan will be invested in purchasing cooking oil. This is one of the most expensive items used for cooking, so it's better purchased in large quantities (a 5 gallon can).

She explains it's difficult to do business in her community because a lot of people sell the same things. She sometimes goes to sell on the streets of nearby communities to sell her merchandise. The other challenge she faces is the size of her community.

Despite receiving limited formal education, she has thus far been able to use her business savvy and hard work to own and operate her own colmado (small retail store). Elsi has been assisted by a loan from Esperanza which she successfully repaid.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan Elsi aims to purchase more inventory for her colmado including charcoal, shoes and meat. Additionally, she has recognized that, given the diverse fashion sense of her clientele and her limited space and resources, that she can most efficiently sell clothing by offering it to order, a setup in which she will collect several orders and then purchase the desired items from a larger city. She intends to use a portion of her new loan to establish this new element of her business.\r\n\r\nElsi's dream for the the future of her business is to continue growing and, for her family, she envisions using her new earnings to purchase a house for her family to live in.

Tecpan municipality in Guatemala.  She has nine children.  Since a very young age she has been characterized as a leader and an innovator.\r\n\r\nShe makes clothing that is typical in her area.  She is a very enterprising woman.  She was in a greenhouse project with many other members.  It was a learning project, and she gained much experience.  She set up her own greenhouse by making small loans.  But, with the children\u2019s expenses she does not have enough working capital.  To earn more she needs to buy fertilizer, fungicide, and other things to keep her greenhouse of tomatoes.\r\n\r\nHer dream for her children is that they have careers.  Her two older children help her now.  They graduated as automobile mechanics.  Her dreams are to have another, bigger greenhouse, to always support her children with the best food, and to build some bedrooms since they now only have three for so many people.\r\n<br

O. lives with his wife and three children in Arhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His two oldest sons go to the local community colleges and the youngest daughter is a high school student.\r\n\r\nTumenjargal has a small carpentry shop in the town where he mostly makes a variety of home and office furniture. Most notably, he made all the wooden furniture for the local government house. He made all the office furniture with traditional style.\r\n\r\nTumenjargal started his carpentry business in 2005 with capital of 150,000 MNT.

Together with his wife, Mavluda Sobirova, he is involved in baking and selling flatbread.  Previously, Abdusodyk worked as a baker at a bread factory.  Much like many of his countrymen, he lost his job after the fall of the Soviet Union.  He has to work a lot in order to support his big family.  His knowledge as a baker came in handy, when his wife and he decided to bake flatbread at home and sell it at the entrance of the food market.  It was hard for them at the beginning because they did not have a permanent retail location.  Big retailers used to force them out of the market.  Now, thanks to a loan from Kiva, they expanded their business and bought a store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":342066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Wholesale purchase of 45 bags of flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rasulov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdusodyk ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117735,"name":"Lach","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lach R., 48, pictured with her daughter, is married and works with three of her five children and her husband in the Kampong Cham province.

He buys calves on the Jabbor-Rasulov cattle market and after feeding them for five to six months he resells them for a better price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":342079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rasulov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdukodir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117745,"name":"Nhu's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nh\u01b0 T. \u0110\u00e0o (no: 010114140015) was born in 1973.

He is 30 years old and is married. To make a living, Junrey owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a \"sari-sari\" variety store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income from the business comes primarily from selling a variety of products in the local community. He also provides transportation services using his motorcycle. Junrey has been engaged in his business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Junrey joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and the ability to engage in business activities. Junrey is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, and a portion of it will be used for maintenance for his motorcycle. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Junrey from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her son is a butcher, whose job is to send livestock to a slaughterhouse.  Gulsunoi sold beef and lamb tallow and, thus, started her business.  Later, she saved enough money to buy an electric meat grinder.  With time, Gulsunoi started to bring ground meat to the market.  She currently wants to expand her business and needs a loan in order to buy a large quantity of meat.

His dream is to have a country with greater opportunities for people who want to work. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":342380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"for the purchase of batteries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caaguaz\u00fa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yomny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177534,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602915,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038990,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951424,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793522,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684291,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078902,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915079,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128950794,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679626,"comment":null},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":272727.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714025,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T03:13:15Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117913,"name":"Kemi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kemi is 23 years old and married with a child.

She had her first baby in February 2009 and it quickly became clear that as a single mom, being able to make her own schedule and bring her baby with her would prove invaluable. Jenny has sold beauty products for two years now and has been steadily building up her client base. \n\nShe would like a $750 loan from ACCION USA to make a bulk order of new and popular merchandise that will allow her to build up her business equity. This way she will be able to create steady income and to provide for herself and her baby. Although sales have been good and have gone back up after the birth of her child, she realizes that to be more profitable, she needs to have the products on hand.

The sowing of the coffee is what he like the most, although they generate a greater investment when he lets them develop a fruit with export quality (first harvest), for which people pay him a very good price. The second harvest is to supply the processor of a friend at a lower price because the fruit is smaller. The good thing is that his earnings nearly always cover his investment, now he is planning to renew his coffee plants to secure good harvests in the coming years. During the harvest times he goes to his farm at 5am, so that at 9am, before breakfast, 3 or 4 baskets of coffee are filled.

For three years he has lived with his one year old son\u2019s mother.  They live in a wood house that he built himself.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age he has planted cocoa, bananas, and citrus fruit.  Sometimes he works as a field worker for his neighbors.  He does this from four in the morning until midday because later than midday the sun is so intense you cannot work comfortably.  His job is to plow, weed, and clean the farms.  According to the area worked, he charges between 150 and 300 PEN.  Sometimes he is paid 17 PEN a day.\r\n\r\nBut when his own products are ready to be harvested, he works preparing them so that every week end he can sell them to various markets.  Sometimes buyers come to his farm and he takes advantage of selling by \u201carrobas\u201d, which consist of 12 kilos of bananas.  This way he accumulates greater income.\r\n\r\nIt fills Milton with joy to be a farmer.  Therefore, he plans to continue working hard until he reaches a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  In previous loan cycles he has demonstrated responsibility and willingness to pay.  He reiterates the same promise with this loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he is asking for he plans to buy ten sacks of fertilizer, which will cost approximately 900-1,000 PEN.

tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora, est\u00e1 casada y vive en su casa propia. Tiene 3 hijos peque\u00f1os que son el motor de su trabajo. Hace 7 a\u00f1os ten\u00eda una discoteca, pero este negocio no le fue muy rentable, entonces empez\u00f3 a vender comida de forma ambulante y al notar el aumento de sus clientes alquil\u00f3 un local donde permaneci\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o. Luego, a base de esfuerzo y con el apoyo de su esposo, logr\u00f3 comprar un terreno donde construy\u00f3 su casa propia y su restaurante denominado \u201cTati\u201d. Ahora Tattehana ya no se preocupa de pagar un alquiler, solo piensa en cambiar la carta diaria del men\u00fa para tener contentos a sus comensales, ya que gracias a ellos y a su trabajo, hoy cuenta  con un techo propio. Hace dos a\u00f1os que tiene su restaurante en su propio local, pero en este negocio lleva 5 a\u00f1os y se siente muy feliz realiz\u00e1ndolo; para el futuro espera adquirir una casa en la ciudad, para que sus hijos crezcan y se formen profesionalmente con mayores comodidades. Este es su quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, en todo este tiempo demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada uno de sus pagos, adem\u00e1s ella estima mucho a todas las integrantes de su banco comunal y por ello las motiva a trabajar con responsabilidad. El dinero que solicita lo planea invertir en la compra de comestibles para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus guisos diarios para su restaurante. ","en":"Tattehana is 31 years old, she is a hard-working lady, married and lives in her own house. She has 3 young children who are the engine of her work. 7 years ago she had a disco, but it was not good business so she started selling food as a street vendor.As the number of clients increased she rented a space where she worked for a year. Then, due to her own effort and with the support of her husband, she succeeded in buying land where she built her house and a restaurant called \"Tati\". Now Tattehana does not worry about paying rent, she only thinks about changing the daily menu to keep clients happy as, thanks to them and her work today she owns her house. She has had the restaurant at her own facility for two years, but has been in this business for 5 years and is very happy. For the future she wants to buy a house in the city for the children to grow and become professionals with more comfort. This is her fifth loan with MFP and she has always been punctual with each of the repayments. She is very fond of the members of her community bank and motivates them to work with responsability. The loan will be invested in buying ingredients to prepare the daily meals for her restaurant.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":342729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase ingredients for a restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oxapampa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10.333333 -75.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-25T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tattehana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990791,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211923,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641451,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080890,"comment":null},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997031,"comment":null},{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":344.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T09:43:11Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":118096,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy A. is from Oroquieta City.

A. is from the town of Aloran, Misamis Occidental. She is 45 years old. Eugenia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Eugenia owns & operates a manicure business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing hairdressing & beauty services to local community members. Eugenia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Eugenia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eugenia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. Eugenia is requesting a new loan of 14900 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the loan taken out by Eugenia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Militar, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Wilma has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Wilma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Wilma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Cecelia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cecelia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cecelia has successfully repaid a previous loan  from GDMPC. Cecelia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Cecelia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 30 years old. Rhubie is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rhubie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a \"sari-sari\" (general) store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste etc., in the local community. Rhubie has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 7750 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Rhubie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rhubie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from GDMPC. Rhubie is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the twelfth loan taken out by Rhubie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Bitibut, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She is 42 years old. Vergie is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Vergie owns & operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Vergie has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vergie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vergie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. Vergie is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Vergie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
