She is therefore requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy vegetables.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":409.6,"image":{"id":899858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Sansar, Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2011-10-25T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altantuul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.81,"local_amount":131250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T09:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":132217.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245321892,"comment":null},{"amount":103.87,"local_amount":132604.69,"processed_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-18T09:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":133581.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251327481,"comment":null},{"amount":93.9,"local_amount":119868.57,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":120751.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257637313,"comment":null},{"amount":109.02,"local_amount":139171.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-18T08:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":140196.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263944594,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-05T03:13:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349153,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley is 52 years old and married.\r\n\r\nShirley works hard to provide for her family.

33, is a taxi driver trying to save money for her son\u2019s future education.

Solongo has been running her business since 2007 and has gained a lot of experience during this period. She is actually a business manager but has still not worked in this occupation as there are no positions available with companies.

is 28 years old.  She is married and has one child, aged four.  In 2000, she established her cow-raising business.  She supports her family by working seven days per week and four hours per day. \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young milk-giving cow.  In the future, Aapasara plans to lift the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung, which is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and for methane production.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":91.67,"image":{"id":899880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aapasara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647945,"comment":null},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-25T09:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865077,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275062,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1666.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416528,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-03T16:32:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349176,"name":"Miguel Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Miguel tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado desde hace tiempo y vive en su propia casa situada en la ciudad de Encarnaci\u00f3n.\nEl se\u00f1or Miguel es comerciante desde hace tiempo, tiene un local de venta de prendas de vestir para ni\u00f1os en el circuito comercial de la ciudad de Encarnaci\u00f3n, tiene mucha clientela y vende diariamente ya que concurren muchos turistas por esa zona.

She is preferred by her customers because she always has first quality product so demand has increased with respect to river and sea shrimp, lobster and a fish known as \u201cboca colorada\u201d [red snapper].  Because of this and with credit experience she has taken INTEGRAL\u2019s hand to get a loan that will permit her to develop still more with her business as well as improving her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":139.45,"image":{"id":899938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy river and sea shrimp, lobster and fish known as \"boca colorada.\"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-10-20T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39.91},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":30.36,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505758,"comment":null},{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":36.87,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713232,"comment":null},{"amount":34.74,"local_amount":34.74,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":34.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116080,"comment":null},{"amount":37.48,"local_amount":37.48,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":37.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241194,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-11T02:06:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349207,"name":"Jeanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanette is separated with one child.

Roberto is well referred to by his neighbors and customers as being responsible, honest and hardworking.  The last four months have seen a rise in demand for his products because a nearby store has moved away so customers from nearby factories prefer him because he stocks the things they need like soft-drinks, candy, sweet bread, medicine, sardines, dairy products and cured meats which sell out quickly and he doesn\u2019t want to have to say \u201cI don\u2019t have any!\u201d  He wants to always satisfy his customers as well as provide daily sustenance for his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":379.91,"image":{"id":899951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock merchandise for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-10-20T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":77.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":79.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":86.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":222.6,"local_amount":222.6,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":222.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713233,"comment":null},{"amount":77.64,"local_amount":77.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116081,"comment":null},{"amount":79.67,"local_amount":79.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":79.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241195,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-02T12:22:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349218,"name":"Hansel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hansel is a 21-year-old fisherman from Talibon, Bohol.

The loan will allow her to buy products to stock the store, such as flour and rice, candies, bread, instant meals, drinks, soap, etc. Blanca Delmi is confident that doing so will help her succeed and give her family a better standard of living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.91,"image":{"id":899911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy staples such as flour and rice, candies, bread, instant meals, drinks, soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-10-20T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Delmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16.6},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24.69},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":18.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":18.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":19.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":26.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":29.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":32.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.99},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.28,"local_amount":65.28,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":65.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505761,"comment":null},{"amount":44.82,"local_amount":44.82,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713237,"comment":null},{"amount":44.47,"local_amount":44.47,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":44.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116085,"comment":null},{"amount":47.34,"local_amount":47.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":47.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241199,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T20:13:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349229,"name":"Ana Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Maribel D.

She is 55 years old and lives with her husband Murad, their 27 year old daughter, and their two sons who are 25 and 23 years old.  Nunu\u2019s daughter is unemployed and her sons serve in the Georgian army. \r\n\r\nNunu works as a nurse at a local medical emergency company.  Along with her very busy main job, she is involved in the family agricultural business, which is led by Murad and is an important source of income for the family.  They have three milk cows and produce 45 kg of traditional Georgian cheese which is sold at the local market each month.  They also have a small pig farm with two pigs and they sell on average 24 piglets per year.  Nunu and Murad grow soy-beans and corn on family owned 1.5 hectares of land.  Only 20% of the harvested crop is sold at the local market, as the rest is used in to feed the cows and pigs.  The total average income for Nunu and Murad is 800 Laris, including Nunu\u2019s salary. \r\n\r\nNunu requested credit for planting nut-trees on 0.6 hectare of land.  The Samegrelo region is well-known in the country for nut-growing.  Harvested nuts are mainly purchased by wholesalers, who export them to Turkey.

They were low-income and his mother was a single parent. The middle child in a set of five, Kevin was the only sibling who took on a job at such an early age to contribute to the household. When he was just 25 years old, he started Spark Electric. He had to network with friends, borrowing equipment and a van, in order to get his foot in the door, but today he has no problem getting contracts, due to his excellent track record of providing top-of-the-line electrical, heating and A\/C services.\r\n\r\nKevin says that being an entrepreneur and business owner is not always easy. Before he owned his own business, all he had to worry about was \"money, cash, jobs, and tools.\" But now, as the boss, he is in charge of making bids and estimates, managing employees, and keeping all of the books. He has had to make mistakes in order to learn to seek advice and he believes that being \"in the field\" is the only way to improve, benefiting from trial and error.\r\n\r\nThe business has faced hardship in the past year because some larger companies try to take advantage of smaller ones like his by contracting them for work but then never paying them. \"They see you as a small fish and feel that they are a shark. They want to eat you for dinner,\" he explains. In his field, businesses are not paid until the \"rough-in,\" the point at which the majority of the installation work is done. Then the contractor will make sure the work is complete and pay Kevin. This means that Spark Electric needs a steady flow of working capital in order to operate. \r\n\r\nKevin will use his loan to pay for tools and equipment that will allow him to take his jobs to that \"rough-in\" point. He is also excited that the Kiva loan will allow him to establish a strong line of business credit so that his business can grow. Kevin's dream is for Spark Electric to become a Fortune 500 company. He wants people to see that a minority graduate of a New Orleans public school can go on to do great things. \"I hope that people can appreciate the love and labor I've put into it,\" he says. \"This loan will help me have a peaceful mind and I won't have to toss and turn at night anymore.\" And as for his business motto, Kevin says he'd \"rather show than tell,\" letting the quality of his work speak for itself.\r\n\r\nAfter he has posed for his Kiva profile picture, Kevin takes off his hat and says he wants a last word: \"Always believe in yourself. Have faith in God and trust. And in the midst of a busy and aggravating world, keep believing. Believe in all that you set out for, and that is going to keep you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":898.63,"image":{"id":898324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"to

Ruslana provides hair cutting services and is also a colorist in her hometown, Nikopol.  She works in a small rented space in the local bathhouse, having turned it into a cozy barber shop.  In this neighborhood there are no other barber shops, which helps the growth of Ruslana's business.  In addition to the lack of competitors the growth of the business has been effected by the help of her husband and Ruslana's own striving for growth.  In the beginning Ruslana worked in sales but then understood that this was not the right sphere for her and decided to start a barber shop.  She has been in this business for only 2 years so far.  Her monthly net profit is around 2,300 hryvnia.\r\n\r\nRuslana plans to invest the KIVA loan of 8,000 hryvnia into paying rent on the space that she leases for work.  Under the terms of her lease she needs to prepay the rent for half a year in advance.  In addition, Ruslana hopes to purchase necessary equipment to work in her beauty salon and to purchase a glass display.

Peter is from Ivano-Frankivsk.  Since childhood, he has had \"golden hands\" and was able to make anything from wood.  At another time, Peter worked as a driver, expediter at a spirits plant.  Then, after taking his friend's advise, he started his own business.  Peter has been involved in making furniture out of chipboard to-order for seven years.  He always has work orders due to having loyal customers and producing quality work.  Currently, his monthly income is 5,000 hryvnia.  Peter has one hired worker.  Having a means of transportation (a 1999 Gazel passenger van) also helps a lot in the business.  Peter plans to invest a loan in the sum of 8,000 hryvnia into a purchase of necessary materials for making furniture, specifically purchasing chipboard and furniture accessories.  In the near future, Peter hopes to buy a new passenger, so that it is easier for him to meet with clients.  Peter loves his family very much and invests a lot into the well-being of his relatives.  One of the interesting facts could be that recently Peter's daughter won a prize at a world championship in track and field (200 meter run and a 4x100 meter relay)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":341.33,"image":{"id":900479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

He tells us that this is the 3rd loan that has been provided to him as a member of this bank.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":146.37,"image":{"id":900522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to fix up his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"San Jos\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Franklin Rafael Israel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":14251.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":14441.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":14634.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":14829.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15027.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15227.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15430.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15636.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15845},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16056.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16270.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16487.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16707.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":16929.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":17155.6},{"due_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":17384.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":17616.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":17851},{"due_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":18089.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":18330.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":18574.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":18822.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":19073.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":19327.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":28693.85,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T08:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":29239.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245498517,"comment":null},{"amount":29.27,"local_amount":14634.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":14912.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251651681,"comment":null},{"amount":29.66,"local_amount":14829.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15111.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257701066,"comment":null},{"amount":30.05,"local_amount":15027.35,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15312.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263289474,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T13:50:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349566,"name":"Somasse-Glotomey Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"SOMASSE-GLOTOMEY est un  groupement compos\u00e9 de quatorze personnes qui vivent toutes dans le m\u00eame quarter et m\u00e8nent toutes des activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus.

She requested a loan for 5,000 lempiras from ODEF in order to start her tortilla business.\r\n\r\nShe managed her payments for her first loan well.  Then she requested two more loans.  Now she is requesting her fourth loan with ODEF to buy corn.  It is the main ingredient she uses to make the tortillas.\r\n\r\nLucila works hard for 12 hours a day making tortillas to satisfy her customers\u2019 demand.  She hopes that her business continues growing in order to be able to invest her earnings in her minor children\u2019s education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":217.53,"image":{"id":900598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Gracias, Lempira","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-10-21T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1016},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":984}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":1016,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244638043,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854463,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264238,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T04:02:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349594,"name":"Luz Del Mundo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Luz del Mundo lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras las cuales han tenido 7 cr\u00e9ditos con Adim en los cuales se han perfilados como clientas AA.

Her goal is to earn a larger profit and increase her customer base, allowing her to pay back the loan and continue giving her family economic support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":111,"image":{"id":900645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To buy larger quantities of beer, corn flour to make \"chicha de jora\" (local beverage) and balanced feed for her chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Las Lomas - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-10-23T09:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":60.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62.85},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.06},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.96,"local_amount":55.9,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":57.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584879,"comment":null},{"amount":21.06,"local_amount":56.15,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":57.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244543075,"comment":null},{"amount":22.61,"local_amount":60.3,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":61.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250753570,"comment":null},{"amount":22.8,"local_amount":60.8,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-24T08:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":62.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257395602,"comment":null},{"amount":23.57,"local_amount":62.85,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":64.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263291308,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-24T01:19:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":349614,"name":"Los Lopez Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Felix Elena quien se dedica a la venta de frutas y verduras desde hace 40 a\u00f1os en el  mercado m\u00e1s grande de Nicaragua.
