Specifically, the loan fund will be used to pay for more inventory for her business, including coconut jam, banana chips, peanut butter, barquillos (wafers), banana fritters, immature rice (pinipig), cashew nuts and other supplies. In the meantime, the profits she makes from her business are saved in preparation for the expense of educating her four children.

Kyegegwa in Mubende. Many people tend to undermine casual work here in Uganda, but the 48-year-old married father of nine children has been able to earn a living through that business for five years. \r\n\r\nCharcoal is commonly used here in Uganda as a form of energy in many homes to cook food and for housewarming in cold places, as prices for paraffin, gas and electricity are always high.

is 25 years old and is married with two children who are 1 and 2 years old. Frederic lives by sewing different styles of clothes and this is his 5th successful year in this business. He operates his business from morning until late in the afternoon hours.\r\n\r\nFrederic needs to request a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company s.a. to purchase four sewing machines and some clothing items. Thus, he will create four jobs for the people in his community.\r\n\r\nBy expanding his business and adding more equipment and workers, Frederic will hopefully earn more profits and these profits will allow him to create other areas of the same business.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have the opportunity to have a viable business. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As a rule she works in the store, however she also has a trading place in the local market. Anbar sells jewellery items of an oriental national style. She has her customers and clients who sell their jewellery to her. People trust Anbar, knowing that she is very honest when assessing the prices and quality. Anbar's business is the main source of income for her family. She has been working with IMON for almost two years. She has proved herself as an honest and reliable borrower. Today she requests $1500 US Dollars. For the loan Anbar plans to purchase new items of jewellery like earrings, rings and bracelets of the oriental style. She thanks all for support and promises to pay the loan in time.\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mahbuba is 49 years old. She is married and the mother of two children. Since she was very young Mahbuba worked on a small farm, and now, along with her children she works cultivating wheat, corn, and vegetables. When their crop comes in they transport it to the capital for sale. This activity has helped to pay for the expenses of her family and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nToday she needs a loan for preparing his land for upcoming season. With this desire in mind she asks your consideration to receive them in your kind heart. She requests $1000 USD. Mahbuba wants to thank everyone for supporting her and promises to repay the loan in time.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a farmer from Kisii town in Western Kenya where she has been farming for 18 years. Her farm produces maize, beans, vegetables, eggs, tea, bananas and milk which she sells to the local market. Her major challenges have been lack of enough money to buy chicken feed, pests and diseases which affect her poultry and the poor weather patterns that affects her produce.\r\n\r\nOlpher has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of KES.50,000 to expand her poultry project by purchasing 300 chicks from Kenchick Company.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He is married, 30 years old, the father of a three-year old boy and a carpenter.\r\n\r\nHe explains that he chose this profession because he learned it as a child as his father was a carpenter and left him his tools so he'd be able to work. He says it is a good business that provides him with a good income. He is going to use the loan to invest in the purchase of materials to continue working, including wood, glue and paint.\r\n\r\nThe earnings he is getting out of the business benefit him and his family very much. He is now financially more secure, which is going to help now that his son is starting preschool and they will have to buy school materials for him. \r\n\r\nHe also says that his business is benefitting the community as there aren't many carpenters in the town and people used to have to go far to order what they need. That's no longer the case, as they now have Joiy's carpenter's worshop nearby.\r\n\r\nHis main goal is to see his son grow up and support him through his studies so that he can have a career and a good profession. He would also like a larger workshop to support his mother, who is a widow and whom he helps financially, and to improve his standard of living.\r\n\r\nHe mentions that all group members are very reliable and responsible workers now they have had the chance to know each other. \r\n\r\nJoniy would like to thank FRAC and KIVA because they have enabled him to own his own business and change his life and his family's. \r\n\r\nCosta Brava group members and their business activities are:\r\nJoniy D.

Bimala thanks you for your support.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While  typical pasals might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Rosalia became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a neighbor, and it interested her so much that she dedicated herself to the task of looking for responsible people that she could work with. This group is located in the community of Chalco, in the state of Mexico.  The members of the group are: Rosal\u00eda L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez (who sells shoes through a catalog), Mar\u00eda Esther V. Mart\u00ednez (who sells fish), Olga Lidia Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez (who sells clothing) y Josefina L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez (who also sells clothing).\r\n\r\nRosalia, 28, is the representative of the group (in the photo she is wearing the purple blouse.)  Her family consists of her husband Jose and their 2 children who are school-aged.  For 6 years she has been selling clothing and shoes through a catalog, since for her what is essential is to have economic stability so she can provide a good future to her children.  Rosalia offers her merchandise to her neighbors, and they also recommend her to their friends and acquaintances.  She gets her products every 15 days, and she says that the majority of her customers are men, which is unusual, but true.  The times of the year she sells the most are when the children return to school and during holidays.  The loan she requests will be used to buy shoes, and with the earning she obtains she will buy school supplies and school uniforms for her children, since for her this is a good investment.  She plans to build her own house and in this way have the space she needs for her family.\r\n\r\nRosalia and the other members are very happy to have formed their group and to receive support from Kiva through the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, because this way they can start to work to accomplish their goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

(construction materials), and Sara Zen\u00f3n M. (lingerie sales by catalog).   \r\n\r\nReyna S. is a single mother with three children, who are already grown and married. She used to work as a cleaning lady, but when she began suffering from osteoporosis, she had to leave her job, since the condition affected her legs. She decided to dedicate herself to another kind of work, so 15 years ago, she began making hand-knitted garments such as blouses, jackets, scarves, sweaters, baby clothes, etc. At the beginning, it was hard for her, but with time and continuous practice, it became easier. At present, she buys magazines to make more modern clothing designs and satisfy her customers' needs. She will use the funds from the loan she is requesting to buy yarn, hook closures, buttons, zippers, etc. Whenever she goes out, Reyna takes a sample garment and also carries supplies to keep working during the journey. She offers her merchandise to her family members and neighbors. She makes the most sales for special days such as birthdays, and during the cold months. With her earnings, she wants to support her daughter with her therapy so that she will be able to walk again, since her daughter also has osteoporosis which is advancing very rapidly. In the future, Reyna plans to open her own store and put her blouses and jackets on display, so that people will get to know her work and she will increase her sales. \r\n\r\nReyna and the other members are grateful for the support provided to them by Kiva through the Realidad Foundation, which will help them achieve their goals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

He came to our office as a result of advertising carried out in this area. He owns a carpentry workshop that mainly produces furniture for bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms.

It\u2019s located in Tepalcingo, a town in the Mexican state of Morelos.  There are 9 members, neighbors, all of whom know one another.  This is their 8th Fundacion Realidad loan.  The members of the group are Araceli O. B., 34, who studied at a secretarial school after leaving high school.  She has two boys: Jesus, 3, and Osvaldo, 7, who is in elementary school.  Araceli operates a business selling Tupperware products.  She needs a loan to buy Tupperware products such as cups, plates, containers, etc. that she will resell to her customers.  She started the business 5 years ago after she was invited to a showing of the products that she now sells.  She learned about the work, discounting, advertising, etc. They gave her the catalogs from which she sells her products, she put in her order and they gave her a week\u2019s credit from the date that she received the order.  The business is important to Arceli.  She uses the earnings from the business to support her household and buy more stock for the business.  She likes the work and she has won gifts and prizes for her efforts, something that spurs her on to work harder.  Her customers are housewives.  She goes door to door to sell her products.  She\u2019s bothered because some people don\u2019t pay when she goes to collect and she faces competition from others who sell the same products.  She wants her children to study for a good career.  Tepalcingo is a lovely place.  The streets have been improved and there\u2019s a fair to celebrate the Senor de Tepalcingo in February or March.

They are happy to be part of this group. They are currently headquartered in the community of Chalco, in the State of M\u00e9xico.\n\nThis borrower is Edith R. R., age 53 (the one in the navy blue sweatshirt). She has a daughter who is 22 and currently working, since she could not continue her studies due to a lack of income in the household. They only have each other for support, since Edith does not receive support from her partner. Edith is a person who has always had to work to get ahead and to buy her medicines, since she suffers from asthmatic bronchitis, but this does not stop her from continuing to work hard. Her business is selling cleaning products such as brooms and fibers out of her home, and also selling secondhand clothing and shoes at the markets near her community. She lays out blankets to display the clothes. At times her business is affected by rain and she sells less. Her best sales days are the weekends. She tries to stock new merchandise every three days so she can offer variety to her customers. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy a little more clothing for her business, along with cleaning products. Her plans for the future are to construct a small extra room in her home and to see her daughter return to her studies so that she can have a better future. \n\nThe other members of this group are:  \nMar\u00eda Trinidad J.

Ch\u00fac is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 04.09.03-Lien Minh- Hoang Truong (04.09.03-Lien Minh- Hoang Truong).\r\n\r\nCh\u00fac is married and has 1 adult child. To making a living, Ch\u00fac owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  Ch\u00fac has been engaged in this business for over 25 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Ch\u00fac joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ch\u00fac has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 4,248,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. The loan will be the 6th loan she has taken out from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Ch\u00fac plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n1.

She hopes to earn enough revenue from the production of chili peppers to keep her children in school. She hopes to improve her economic situation and offer a better standard of living to her family.

Bonfal East, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 28 years old. Marvin is married and has two infant-aged children. To make a living, Marvin owns & operates a business cultivating coconut trees & harvesting its fruit for sale. Marvin has been engaged in his business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marvin joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marvin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to pay for services to increase the crop yield. Marvin is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marvin from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
