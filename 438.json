She sells general merchandise, which she sells door-to-door, and she also sells her products from her home. Currently, something that has affected her and the majority of people in the country has been illnesses. She started this business two years ago in partnership with a sister, and with time she gained her own capital and has now been able to work individually. She started selling very little, since people didn't know her, but she has been gaining customers and has been able to establish a good business. The requested loan will be invested in the purchase of basic materials and to offer new products to her customers. Her dream now is to make improvements to her home, since she wants to have the business in one single location; to set up a store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":577526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-07-30T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heidi Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.39,"local_amount":707.73,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":758.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848883,"comment":null},{"amount":35.18,"local_amount":703.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":754.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256823,"comment":null},{"amount":34.97,"local_amount":699.38,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":749.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802818,"comment":null},{"amount":35.24,"local_amount":704.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T10:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":755.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956649,"comment":null},{"amount":35.07,"local_amount":701.47,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":751.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685762,"comment":null},{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":712.85,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":764,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191424899,"comment":null},{"amount":70.35,"local_amount":1406.99,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201285987,"comment":null},{"amount":33.66,"local_amount":673.13,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":721.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211227043,"comment":null},{"amount":34.5,"local_amount":690.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":739.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239091396,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-30T19:09:14Z","paid_date":"2011-11-18T09:29:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219539,"name":"Genesis 2 & 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juana Margarita is the coordinator of her group Genesis 2 & 3 (Genesis).

He lives in Daroukhane, in the town of Guediawaye. He's single and without children. Mr. B. is a young spare parts reseller, who chose this business out of passion. Eager to obtain an income source that could help him provide for himself, he's been selling spare parts for many years. It is a good business during the holidays and during the school year. \r\n\r\nMrs. B. has been a member of the Baye credit association since March 2003, but he never benefited from a loan within the institution. At this time, he's seeking a XOF 200'000 loan, to be used to buy spare parts for resale. According to him, the loan will enable him to diversify the product line he offers to his clientele. As a consequence, this will give him the opportunity to increase his profits, put money away, and support his parents.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

Gladis makes nacatamales (a special type of large tamale often sold in Nicaragua), and in addition she sells firewood, beans, ice and soft drinks from her home, all on a cash basis.  She has had this business for more than 5 years.  Her goal in starting the business was to have a secure source of income to support herself and her family.  She learned to always work hard from her mother, who taught her to make nacatamales and sent her and her sisters out into the street to sell.  In this way, she learned how to support herself.  She requests a loan to invest in her business so that she can continue to work and obtain better earnings.

Iris).  She started when she was 24 along with her husband who had experience from his family in raising cattle.\r\nThey bought cows to fatten up and that meant that the cows weren\u2019t well-fed: they nourished them with grasses from the Sierra, and balanced food so that they could later sell them when they were fatter in the center of the city.  Some months ago they had a problem with grass scarcity in the Sierra because of the lack of rain.  The first loan that she received was to buy more dairy cows.  The milk that the animals produce is sold in the markets where it is used especially to make cheese.  In the past they wasted a lot because of having to transport the cattle to the markets in the capital.  Currently this has changed since they are the producers; they have their regular customers in the capital and these buyers sell it in the markets.  The cattle business served to educate their children who are today professionals and now they are able to support their parents.

All of them are very enthusiastic. For them, the name of the dream is getting ahead in the businesses they run and doing their best for their loved ones. \r\n\r\nThis is the case with Sonia, who sells vegetables and root crops in the mornings (spinach, potatoes, carrots, peas, corn, limes, lettuce and others) on a well-known and busy street. She tells us that since she was a girl, she accompanied her father when he sold these vegetables at a market. She didn't like this idea very much because she was a bit shy, but her attituD. changed when she went through a separation from her former partner, and due to this, she had to work for the sake of her daughter who was still very young. She did this alone, because her father had died, and this led her to the decision to work as her father had taught her. \r\n\r\nIt was not easy at first, because there were not many buyers, and sometimes the merchandise was ruined because of the national strikes or landslides and mudslides (avalanches) in the area, so that the products she carried from the mountains to the cities were spoiled. However, she persisted and kept working hard until she became well-known in the neighborhood where she sells her products. This has helped her to support her mother and her daughter, whom she tries to give the best education possible. She has bought a small plot of land in a settlement that will soon be constructed. For the moment, she has set up a small wooden house. Having a sales stand of her own is one of her distant goals, which she hopes to achieve with the income from this work. She needs to keep investing in this business to achieve her goals, and it is for this reason that she needs the loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":577576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Buying vegetables and root crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-03T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magno Valerio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucinda Severa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3050,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275.18,"local_amount":763,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":776.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831585,"comment":null},{"amount":274.82,"local_amount":762,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":775.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098127,"comment":null},{"amount":275.18,"local_amount":763,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":776.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390796,"comment":null},{"amount":274.82,"local_amount":762,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":775.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529076,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T23:46:50Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219562,"name":"Nancy Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy, tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 2 hijos y una casa propia.

When her father got sick he could not pay for her to continue in school.  Tere struggles day to day in her business.  She does this to support her two children who are in high school.  She wants to give them the opportunity that she did not have.  That way they will be able to study for a career and triumph in life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de la Luz R.G. has a seamstress shop.  She tells us that for 13 years she worked for other people.  Her greatest wish was to have own shop.  The first machine she got was with help from the government.  The second machine she won in a raffle in the community church.  The third is a five thread overlock that she bought.  The loan is to buy fabric and to be able to make bread.  She comments that she has put a million efforts and dedication into her business.  It has been her source of income.  She contributes to the household expenses because her husband does not earn enough.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT:\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda V.R.\r\nTREASURER:\r\nBeatriz

Later, she offered her services for cooking for events such as birthdays, christenings, anniversaries, etc.  Little by little she has become well known so that a lot of people request her services, and she receives a lot of contracts.  \n\nWhat she wants most is to own and manage her own restaurant.  She already has a place for it in her house, and only lacks capital in order to start.  For the time being, she will continue saving in order to attain her goal.

She graduated with a degree in law so has always earned a good salary that allowed her to live comfortably.  Sadly, however, a change in government led to her losing her job and, due to her advanced age, it was very difficult for her to find new employment.  She is a widow with a son to support.  She looked for a way to earn a living and an acquaintance of hers taught her about the cosmetics sales business, ironically the same brand of cosmetics she herself used when she could afford them.\r\n\r\nGradually and with just the 100 soles she had on hand she bought some products and started to sell them door-to-door.  She has now been in this line of work for 5 years.  She recruits others to work and now has a team of 95 salespeople under her leadership.  She earns a percentage of their sales.  \r\nBecause of the large number of people she supervises, her earnings are substantial and she is able to cover her expenses and live well.  The loans help her buy her work tools like catalogues, samples, etc.  They also help defray travel costs associated with her trips to train her saleswomen.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is treasurer of the \u201cUNIDAS TRIUNFAREMOS\u201d (Together We Will Triumph) group.

Since her children are young, she has to work to give them a better quality of life. She remembers buying clothing for herself and her children in a market in their area shortly after starting work at Gamarra [the largest commercial center in Lima] making clothing. It was then that she noticed that what she paid for the clothing she bought was twice their original price. She also discovered that the clothing makers got the clothing for less. For this reason she decided to open a business selling clothing. She started buying from the merchants whom she knew, and they encouraged her to do it because of her charisma. As in all businesses, at the beginning it was difficult because she did not have capital. Knowing the business was very helpful because she invested the money from her first loan to purchase some garments such as polos, pants and blouses. Her business has given her much satisfaction, as for example she can have various comforts in her home, buying fixtures that she did not have. With this recent loan she will be able to purchase more clothing to sell, taking advantage of the dates where there are many sales. In the future she wants to have another business that has to do with the area of food or groceries. She is working and saving up for this.

G. is a 49-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a fishing business. She lives in St. Peter Village, Brgy Aguisan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Melve is now borrowing PHP 17,000 to use as additional working capital.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Melve aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She began working with a solidarity group of three people; later, the group dissolved and requested individual loans. Virginia has used her loans to increase her stock of merchandise. This is reflected in her business, which is well-stocked with a range of products. Thanks to its location, it receives a lot of traffic, since it is a store on the access road to two areas, Coqueni and Santa F\u00e9. Virginia lives with her husband and her daughters. One of her daughters is married, and Virginia sometimes takes care of her granddaughter. The other daughter is a student. With the funds from the loan, Virginia will buy fruits, vegetables, cookies, crackers, soft drinks, candy and other assorted grocery items. She is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence placed in her in granting the loan.

and her husband started their dry cleaning business 12 years ago in Queens, New York. After moving to the United States in the early '70s, Soo knew that, with her experience in the dry cleaning business, she would one day open up her own storefront. With the help of their two children, their dry cleaning business became a staple in their community.\r\n\r\nWith the economic recession, Soo\u2019s business suffered from increased prices. With increases in oil, supplies and energy resources, Soo was forced to increase prices in her store. However, with strategic cutbacks and determination, her business was able to keep its doors open. \r\n\r\nToday, Soo has her third loan with ACCION USA. This loan will allow her to buy a new dry cleaning machine. Without this machine, Soo was forced to send many of her clients to a different dry cleaning business. This loan will allow her to retain more of the clients that come into her store and offer more specialized services.\r\n\r\nSoo and her husband dream of eventually opening a dry cleaning business in Manhattan. With the confidence of having weathered the worst of the economic crisis, Soo is optimistic about their business\u2019s future. Soo says her greatest success with owning her own business has been sending her eldest son to a university in New York. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

In the area where he lives, the people who know him consider him someone they can trust and  someone who is always willing to provide help when needed. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":577864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repairing and maintaining his moto-taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-07-31T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel Brady","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":162.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":171.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":176.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":179.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":184.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":192.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":194.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.35,"local_amount":282.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":288.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832924,"comment":null},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099526,"comment":null},{"amount":112.66,"local_amount":310.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":317.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530305,"comment":null},{"amount":57.41,"local_amount":158.37,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188667255,"comment":null},{"amount":62.21,"local_amount":171.63,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409753,"comment":null},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":176.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":180.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108194,"comment":null},{"amount":65.03,"local_amount":179.37,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270328,"comment":null},{"amount":207.35,"local_amount":572.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":585.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-31T21:54:18Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219650,"name":"Sa\u00fal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sa\u00fal es un padre de familia de 55 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y sus dos hijos en el caser\u00edo Colera, una zona rural del distrito de Tambogrande, un distrito agr\u00edcola caracterizado por dedicarse principalmente al cultivo de plantas frutales, las frutas que producen son procesadas para luego ser exportadas al extranjero.

This job is considered to be hard because of the heavy weight of the machines.  Her husband is an importer of industrial machines and as a result, he is not at home.  They have two children that are still young.  Margarita sacrifices a great deal of effort for her work.  The loan will be invested in the purchase of Japanese machines.  She is very grateful for Emprender and Kiva for the trust provided in granting the loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva

R. is from the village of Mitimos, Rizal.

Buenaventurada has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Buenaventurada joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Buenaventurada has successfully repaid her previous loan of 10,000 PHP. Buenaventurada is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used for corn production. This loan is Buenaventurada's eighth loan from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template to help Field Partners continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She has successfully repaid her previous loan of 7,000 PHP. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business.

This will be the 7th loan taken out by Lolita from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She is 24 years old. Minda D. is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMinda is married and has 3 young children. To make a living, Minda owns & operates a fish vending business, primarily selling fresh, ocean-caught fish in the local community. Minda has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Minda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Minda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for the business. Minda is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used for house completion. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Minda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Fish vending and frozen foods businesses. Her husband, Mariano A. Jr., is 60 years old and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 21 to 25 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonarda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leonarda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 increased her business turnover and helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 45000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to buy more frozen products and more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family. Leonarda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 51 years old, married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Rudilla owns and operates a business venture in the food sector in fishing. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from the selling of ocean-caught fish in the local community. Rudilla has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rudilla joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rudilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes. Rudilla is requesting a new loan of 14,950 PHP which will be used to pawn a parcel of land. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rudilla from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Vilma B. is from Barangay Aquino, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 37 years of age and is married to Roseller, an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker). She is blessed with two children who are now in their elementary grades.\r\n\r\nVilma is presently engaged in operating a fishing boat and fishing nets. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind business for nine years already and earns approximately 10,000 Php a month from this business activity. She is also receiving support from her husband in the form of an allotment.\r\n\r\nJust this year, 2010, Vilma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is an active member of PMPC under its Regular Loan Program and has successfully repaid a loan of Php 25,000.\r\n\r\nVilma is now requesting a loan of 45,000 Php as her 2nd loan to be used to purchase additional fishing equipment (a secondhand Mitsubishi engine for their fishing boat). The remaining amount will be used to finish their house.\r\n\r\nVilma plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, especially to meet their basic needs, to save for future use and for her children\u2019s education, to make loan repayments, to pay for insurances, and to use for possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

B. is a 67-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store.  She lives in  Brgy 5, Tanjay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8000. \r\n\r\nMonchita is now borrowing PHP 19,500 to use as additional working capital.  This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Monchita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  'Dungganon' way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Lolita is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lolita Friolo\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nLolita is blessed with 6 children of whom three are already married while the other three are now teenagers and presently working in different companies.  To earn their living, Lolita decided to engage in operating a sari-sari (variety) store. Also she is receiving support from her husband Segundino who is a farmer. For 3 years already, she was able to maintain her business  activities and at this time she is earning an average net income of not less than Php1,500 a month which is helpful to their family budget.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao and awarded Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006, she joined the cooperative this year, 2010. As a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting the amount of Php 4,000 as her 1st loan to be used as additional capital for her existing sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to improve living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, for loan repayments to PMPC, savings and for possible business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is a married woman who lives in Prk.

Her husband Emerlito C., who is 56 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are 25 to  40 years old. \r\n\r\nLuz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luz has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3500,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, part of which she intends to use as working capital for her general store and also to pay off the remaining balance of the multi-cab mini-truck she previously bought on installments and that she uses in her business. She is working hard so that she can continue to save up for the future well-being and security of her family.

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

She is 37 years old and is the group leader of this three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Merly P. Group.\r\n\r\nMerly is married and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Merly joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase pig feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nMerly is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. This loan will be her 6th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

N. is 21 years old and lives in the town of Nasana in the Kampala east region of Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children.  Two of her children are currently in school.  To earn a living, Sharon has been selling fruit for 5 years.  She also sometimes sells charcoal. Sharon is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to buy more fruits and expand her business, generating more profit in order to support her family. In the future, Sharon hopes to own a house.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":577465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

M. is from the village of Lagag.

She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $95 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Julieta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

In the future, Hellen hopes to educate her children up to university and to start a business raising chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":577473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is married to Rael, a housewife. They have two children: Daniel, 24, who is a welder and Veril, 22, a teacher. \r\n\r\nJohn has been in the tailoring and dressmaking business for the last twenty-eight years and has vast experience in this art. He can design any kind of clothing and he feels that the speed of his business' growth would have been higher had he gotten access to micro-finance earlier, at the start up of his business. \r\n\r\nHe is taking his third loan from Kadet after successfully completing two previous loans without default.

Teodora is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Teodora from PMPC.

She sells the crops to a buyer when they have matured. Her husband helps her with the farm work. \r\n\r\nEm P. has four school-aged children. All four of them are students but work on the farm when they are free from school. With the rainy season approaching and the heavy rains falling, it is a good time for planting. However, Em P. does not have enough farm supplies to use on her field. Em P. is therefore asking for capital to use toward purchasing fertilizer and seeds for growing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":569604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To use toward purchasing fertilizer and seeds for growing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kompong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2010-08-03T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Em","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2004500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182853651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T17:20:17Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:47:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219884,"name":"Merlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlyn O. is from the village of Upperville, Nazareth, Cagayan de Oro City.

D. is from the village of Dalacon. She is 50 years old. Leonora is widowed and has 8 children. To make a living, Leonora owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Leonora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 53 years old. Nenita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Nenita owns & operates a business selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nenita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nenita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

C. is from the village of Rizal, Lopez Jaena. She is 57 years old. Elizabeth is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Elizabeth owns and operates a business selling home products. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Elizabeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Elizabeth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The loan will be used to buy more charcoal. Margret plans to use the loan to expand her business and generate a better profit in order to help her family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Margret hopes to own a house and build a bigger business.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

C. is a married woman who lives in Phase 3, Block 5, Fatima Village, Brgy. Rizal, San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a <i>sari sari<\/i> (general store) and as a wholesaler of Pepsi products. Her husband, Escolastico C. Sr., 55 years old, works as a businessman to earn his living. She has four children who are 20 to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorentina  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP; thus, improving the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP which she intends to use for her sari sari store so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve their lives. Florentina C. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

Florence is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in Kampala\u2019s eastern region of Uganda. She is single and has two children. Her children are currently in school. Florence has a business selling vegetables, which she has had for less than one year. She has a pay phone business as well.\r\n<p> \r\nTo help expand her business, Florence is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. She plans to use the loan to buy more vegetables and so expand her business. She will use all profits to help her children. In the future, Florence hopes to own a house.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout BRAC Uganda\r\n<p>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":578296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

B. lives in Kok-Tokoy village in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is 46 years old and has two children. Kulgaaky\u2019s son and daughter help her with the farming and the household. She graduated from Kyrgyz National University and works as a teacher of the English language in a local school. She is a very responsible, honest and optimistic person. Unfortunately, the salaries of teachers in rural areas are very low and do not cover the expenses of the household. That\u2019s why, in 1998, Kulgaaky used her savings of 10,000 Kyrgyz soms to start up her business in cattle-breeding and farming. She bought one milk cow, whose milk she sold to her loyal customers. Also, she bought mineral fertilizers to cultivate a plot of land where she planted kidney bean seeds. Kulgaaky and her family worked hard to get a rich harvest. \r\n\r\nKulgaaky\u2019s striving to provide her children with a better life motivated her to get a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz soms for cattle breeding. Kulgaaky used her loan as intended and repaid it without any delays. Using the revenues from her first loan, Kulgaaky bought a car for her family. Kulgaaky plans to use this loan of 20,000 Kyrgyz soms to buy one more milk cow in order to increase her milk sales and acquire new customers. Also, she plans to purchase mineral fertilizers to cultivate her plot of land. With the revenues from this loan, Kulgaaky plans to pay for a good education for her son, who wants to be a designer. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target an especially vulnerable population.

C. is a 43-year-old, married woman who supports her family by operating a Ready-to-Wear clothes business. She and her family live in Prk kaisdaan, Brgy Daga, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Ready to Wear business, she is gradually making her family more stable economically. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,000. Marites is now borrowing PHP 10,000 to increase the working capital for her Ready to Wear business. This will be her 6th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Marites aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped increase her monthly profit to PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more materials for her shell handicraft business. She can then continue to save for the future, expand her business and become an exporter of shell handicrafts. Gumercinda I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

O. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Tapon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns a living by operating a beauty salon. Her husband, Eduardo O. who is 42 years old, works as a barber and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are 10 to 19 years old. \r\n\r\nMaristela  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maristela  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 45,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 75,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 49,500 which she intends to use as additional working capital and to purchase equipment for her beauty salon. She can then continue to save up for the future and security of her children. Maristela O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a married woman who lives in San Antonio, Brgy. Kabac, Bantayan, Cebu City. She earns a living by operating 3 business ventures: selling Ready to Wear clothes, farming and pig fattening. Her husband, Sulpicio A. who is 53 years old, works as a farmer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 8 children who are 15 to 32 years old. \r\n\r\nApolonia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Apolonia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her to earn a monthly profit of PHP 40,000,  raising her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital. She can then continue to save up for the future, improve her business and pay her children's tuition fees. Apolonia A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She sells school supplies outside a school near her home. Elena is also inventive and handmakes accessories and decorations, primarily on wood (signs for rooms, frames and gift boxes), but also plaster masks and mirrors. She also has a knack for making delicious chocolates. She learned these crafts on her own. \nElena will use her loan to purchase materials (such as wood and plaster) needed to produce accessories and decorations, with the purpose of making merchandise in preparation for the Christmas fairs in December. In addition, she will also purchase some school supplies for resale. Elena's dream is to one day open a workshop studio geared to providing single mothers with a venue to make their crafts and provide open hours for the public at large. Elena wants to focus on single mothers because she knows that many of them do not own property. Her own experience, as a single mother of an eleven-year-old son and taking care of her seven-year-old nephew, inspires this dream. \nElena has enjoyed working with Kiva partner, Fondo Esperanza, as it has motivated her interaction with other entrepreneurs within the communal bank. \nLa Florida is a community located in the southeast of Santiago (the capital of Chile). The community is quite diverse, representing all sectors of socio-economic levels. La Florida has an active commercial life, which is manifested in the existence of several new shopping centers.

With the little money that she had saved she began selling the products door to door every day.  Since she had stocked up on the products, she practically had to go out daily to be able to recuperate her investment.

This is all toward the goal of improving the economy of her family so that her children can go to the University soon and she will be able to support them with the expenses because she has no family members who support her in raising her children.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anna Ruby Waxham Blackwell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":578432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Improvement of crop harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-08-05T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.08,"local_amount":1061.63,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1137.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078249,"comment":null},{"amount":40.14,"local_amount":802.82,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":860.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211148029,"comment":null},{"amount":206.78,"local_amount":4135.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4432.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T11:14:39Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219990,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase four tires for his public transportation vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":644.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":663.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":683.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":703.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":724.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":745.61},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":767.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":790.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":813.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":837.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T11:35:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219991,"name":"Reina Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reina Concepci\u00f3n tiene 55 a\u00f1os, su actividad econ\u00f3mica es brindar el servicio de costura.

For the last 5 years, she has made <i>chicharrones<\/i> [fried pork rinds] and <i>caldos de gallina<\/i> [chicken soup], dishes that are very popular in Peru.  She sells them everyday, from her house or by delivery to various points in the area where she lives.  Her potential customers are policemen at the police station and people who own shops near her house.  With such an influx of people, she ends up selling everything by midday.\r\n\r\nHer favorite thing about her work is that she only does it in the mornings, and is able to dedicate the rest of the day to her children.  In the future, she is thinking about expanding her business.  In order to achieve this, she will continue working as she always has, with the goal of providing her children with a healthy quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with Microfinanzas Peru and she promises to make all of her repayments on time.

S. is 38 and married with 5 children.

Tiomai needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or ~US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tiomai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Tiomai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

M. is 55 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Malia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST$1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Malia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

A.  is 32 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Theresa A. has 1 year of experience in this business.  Theresa A. needs a loan of WST$1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Theresa A. joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Theresa A.'s only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.
