They live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her parents are retired and her only daughter attends the 87th secondary school of Bayanzurh district in their town.  Munhtuul operates a snuff bottle retailing business at Naraantuul, the biggest and most crowded market in Ulaanbaatar city. She began her business in 2000 and since then she has gained many skills and much experience in her operation. Munhtuul purchases snuff bottles in bulk in Ereen, the border city of Mongolia, once a month. The products she imports are the various stones with snuff bottle shapes. She assembles and makes the head of the snuff bottle herself by hand, which has to be matched to its main body. Munhtuul manages her assembly process in her small crafts shop. The most profitable season for her business is during Mongolian Traditional Lunar New Year and most of her purchasers and clients are the people who arrive from the countryside.  Munhtuul is a creative and skilled woman who works hard to afford her daughter's education expenses and wishes her daughter to enter a university and obtain a good education.

Tomatoes, pickles and fresh mint leaves are sometimes added to complete the masterpiece. This is why everyone, from the richest rich to the beggar in the street, eats this mouth-watering snack. Served as breakfast, lunch or dinner, the mankousheh is light on the stomach and on the pocket. In fact, this sandwich has become a symbol of the Lebanese national identity. It must be as old as the culture since no one knows when it was invented, but everyone has tasted it and loved it. So this is partly why the Lebanese abroad miss three things only: their homes, their family and the mankousheh. \r\n\r\nSo as a 45-year-old married man with three children and as an owner of a mankousheh bakery, Ali is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua in order to increase the business\u2019 capital, and to buy necessary gas and flour to keep this mankousheh in its royal place. \r\n\r\nThis is his third time to request a loan from Al Majmoua, and he proved to be a person in good standing.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

K.  lives in Kamishanovka village in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is 57 years old and has two daughters, one of whom lives with her. Seysekul has been married to her husband, Japarbek, for 35 years. During these years, this couple went through some difficult times but always supported each other in all activities. Now, Seysekul and her husband are on a pension and have only 3,200 KGS monthly, which does not meet all expenses of the household at all.  \r\n\r\nIn order to support her family, Seysekul decided to start animal breeding. She bought several bull-calves, fattened them, and sold them at the local market.  But she could not enlarge her business because she needed to pay for expensive medical treatment for her husband. \r\n\r\n Today, Seysekul has only one sheep at her farm. She plans to use the loan of 85,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing one milk cow and two bull-calves. With the revenue from this investment, Seysekul plans further development of her household.

She lives in her own home, with her husband and their teenage son. Since over 7 years ago, she has sold household goods, vegetables and general groceries from the front room of her house. Her customers are the housewives from her neighbourhood, who appreciate the attentive service she offers them. Her store is the busiest in the area, so she stocks up with plenty of chicken, meat, vegetables and fresh fruit - perishable every day products. Lucia is happy with the business she has built: it is calm and enjoyable to work there, and at the same time she can take care of her home and her family's wellbeing.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, she hopes to grow and diversify her business - for instance she would like to have a bookshop, because no-one in her area is in that line of business. This is Lucia's 15th loan with [field partner] MFP, and she promises to make all her repayments on time as she has been doing up to now. She also looks forward to working with her companions in the communal bank.

This is her fifteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she promises to make all of her repayments, as she has been doing.  Furthermore, she is the most committed member of her communal bank.

She rented a stall with the little funds she had and started to sell food like: beans, lentils, wheat, etc.\r\n\r\nShe started out selling just a few kilos but now her business has grown quite a bit.  She currently offers more variety and quantity.  She also has to fry up more meals and she went into the diced vegetable sales business, something housewives were requesting.  Thanks to her efforts and work she has managed to reach many goals.\r\n\r\nOne of them was to build her house where she also has several rental units that she will lease to earn extra income.  She will use the loan to finish part of the construction.  She also wants to buy herself a mototaxi (three-wheel vehicle used to transport passengers and cargo) because she spends a lot of time moving her ingredients to the market where she works.\r\n\r\nFor the future she\u2019s looking for an additional market where she can install her business so that she can grow.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has just been named the new President of the \u201cSAN JUAN MASIAS\u201d communal bank which is composed of 7 hard working members like her.\r\n\r\n* Mar\u00eda is at the end of the row, the last one on the right, dressed in black.\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":585033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To finish building her rental units.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Callao","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscila Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryuri Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yanderith Singler","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Isidora Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Melody Soraya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098161,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390830,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529110,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665219,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T21:33:12Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223283,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia tiene 44 a\u00f1os y vive en el distrito de Cachimayo provincia de Anta departamento del Cusco junto con su esposo y sus  5 hijos.

Mar\u00eda says her goal is to have a house of her own and provide her children with the best education so that they can go far in life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":585085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase trousers, blouses, T-shirts, and dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandra De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Etelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marjorie Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexandra Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimmy Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Valeria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica De La Nube","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3850,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":320.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":962.49,"local_amount":962.49,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":962.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113533,"comment":null},{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":641.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":641.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407225,"comment":null},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":320.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":320.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388314,"comment":null},{"amount":320.83,"local_amount":320.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":320.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388315,"comment":null},{"amount":403.59,"local_amount":403.59,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":403.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682810,"comment":null},{"amount":1200.6,"local_amount":1200.6,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421961,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-19T17:44:30Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223297,"name":"Elvin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvin C. is from the village of Yumbing, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

is 31 years old and lives on his brother's land in a Mongolian traditional nomadic tent with his wife and two children, aged 14 and 2. \r\n\r\nHe owns two secondhand minivans (people carriers) and got a contract with the transportation authority to carry people on two separate remote bus lines. He has been running his transportation business since 2002.  His wife works with him as a cashier. \r\n\r\nBatdorj is a very hardworking, optimistic person whose goal is to extend his business and provide good education for his kids.

D. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Pasil, Santander, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: livestock and ice cream vending. Her husband Jesus D., who is 58 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have eight children who are between 21 and 39 years of age.\r\n\r\nRemedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her thirteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. With her previous loan of PHP 10,000, she was able to earn a monthly income of PHP 5,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, Remedios borrowed PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional livestock so that she can continue to save for the future.\r\n\r\nRemedios is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

San Juan, Brgy. Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and E-load\/gasoline retailer businesses. Her husband Eddie C., who is 35 years old, works as a pastor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 6 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nRema joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rema has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to purchase a pig, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children, and as additional capital for her existing businesses. Rema C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have three children who are between 19 and 26 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nVeronica joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, further uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan she is requesting PHP 250000 to buy feed and stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for family and business improvements. Veronica Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Soprima\u2019s wish to offer her children a better hope fuels her pledge to her project.\r\n\r\nThe attached picture of Soprima was taken August 3, 2010 with her supportive son, Romel

These virtues, she says, have won her stripes and laurels in the 10 years she has been at the helm of a clothes-selling business in Seeta-Mukono. Her customers cut across from the lowest common denominators to the middle-class people around Seeta trading center-Mukono. In a week, she makes 200,000 shillings.

Her husband Angelito C., 32 years old, works as a carpenter & trisikad driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  \r\n\r\nThey have 6 children who are between 9 and 24 years old. Lilibeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in March, 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilibeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to buy more food and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lilibeth C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Jackie has a business selling clothes, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackie has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Jackie hopes to generate greater profits and treat her cancer sickness. In the future, Jackie hopes to own a shop and educate her child.      \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":584633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

V. is separated and lives in Purok Lubi, Barangay Tiglawigan, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: a general store, raising hogs and selling cosmetics.  Amabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family.\r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future to support her family's basic needs and for her children\u2019s education.

He used to drive a local bus but three years ago he started driving a rented rickshaw because of the difficult timings of bus driving. Now he has decided to start his own rickshaw business. In this way, he will make more income for his family because he won't have to pay the rental cost to the owner. Therefore, Samina has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her husband buy his own rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe has a son who works in a motor-workshop.

Matapat, Brgy. San Jose, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan. She earns her living by operating 5 business ventures: a car shop, a general store, an eatery, a tailoring business and a frozen products business. Perlita's shop specializes in making motorcycle sidecars, repainting trucks and cars, and assembly of any type of vehicle. \r\n\r\nHer husband Neofito I., who is 56 years old, works as a Technician\/Driver\/Mechanic to earn a living. They have 2 children who are 26 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nPerlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Perlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, thus elevating the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000. She intends to use the loan to purchase a passenger bus so that she can continue to save  for future investments and for her family. Perlita I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

somebody\u2019s brains to make use of his or her ideas is not something new in business, as 43-year-old M. Stephen will attest. Some may call it emulating, but this may go beyond that as one may try to painstakingly make deductions of how a particular individual\u2019s business plans were brought to fruition.\r\n\r\nThis is the course of action Stephen took after dropping out of school. First he was a shamba boy (a gardener or field hand). The thought of remaining a shamba boy all his life unnerved him very much. He knew the future was not that rosy with odd jobs like that.\r\n\r\nAt length, after studying most of his closest friends, Stephen began his poultry business. As the saying goes, the rest is history as he has made steady strides ever since. This business brings him 700,000 shillings a month and he is one happy man. He also supplements these profits with earnings from coffee and milk sales.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Stephen is looking at buying more chickens and chicken feed for his

They all have traditional families and on average they are 35 years old, with 7 children. \r\n\r\nThey harvest peanuts, peas and corn. \r\n\r\nKadia D. plans on investing the funds to purchase a large enough quantity of peanut seeds and other miscellaneous agricultural materials from the Kimparana market. After the winter months the harvest is stocked away until that time that the asking price can be improved.  The harvest will be sold in the Kimparana market and other neighbouring markets. The sales can be finalized as wholesale and can be paid for in cash. The clientele usually comes from larger cities. \r\n\r\nKadia D. will earn, following the sale of her harvest, a profit of 40 FCFA and these earnings will be used to repay the loan and the interest, and it will also be used to cover the family's expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":585344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and other agricultural materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Warasso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa  Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Seni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayama Seni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Souraka Youba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-24T08:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":306337.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226152,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T01:08:44Z","paid_date":"2011-05-24T08:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223496,"name":"Fahmida Nasreen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fahmida nasreen lives in the small city of Borewala in Pakistan.

She is 47 years old and has been living in this city for the last 13 years with her husband, an electrician,  and four children. One daughter is a teacher in nearby school; her eldest son is also an electrician.  Razia owns and operates a sewing business to support her family financially. She takes orders for clothing from her nearby community and generates income by completing them. \r\n\r\nRazia\u2019s husband wants to expand his business by buying more electric tools so that both he and her son will be able to serve for more customers. Presently, they both use the same tools resulting in one of them having to wait for the other to be finished with the tools..

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Gregoria has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4300 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nGregoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gregoria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. Gregoria is requesting a new loan of 23000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Gregoria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
