She lives with them in La Victoria district, one of the most densely-populated districts in the region, five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nRosa is a teacher by profession and since she was very young she felt committed to children's education.  She took advantage of a nationwide government initiative and set up a specialized educational center for children aged two to five (PRONOEI) in her home.\r\n\r\nPRONOEI are educational centers that are financed by municipalities and children's parents.  Their public aim is for children who come from poor families to gain the knowledge and tools they need to develop their learning capacity.\r\n\r\nRosa's PRONOEI center does not only provide children with academic knowledge.  She also has contracts with two teachers: a music teacher and a dance teacher.  Currently, Rosa would like to make some improvements to one of her bathrooms so that she can make the children in her school more comfortable once they start their school.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan of 2,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nRosa has already had a Kiva loan through Edpyme Alternativa and their seed money product.  On that occasion, she was able to build an additional classroom so that she could serve more children.  She is grateful to the people who, through Kiva, have helped her to provide a better service to her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":686946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"To carry out improvements in one of her bathrooms so that she can make her pupils more comfortable","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Victoria - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-01-07T12:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Nila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":139.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":140.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":152.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":153.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":158.51},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":162.26},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":168.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.3},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":180.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":185.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":190.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":196.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.21},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.61,"local_amount":139.61,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":141.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410623,"comment":null},{"amount":50.78,"local_amount":140.08,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":142.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196109034,"comment":null},{"amount":110.9,"local_amount":305.92,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":310.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201271198,"comment":null},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":158.51,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210302,"comment":null},{"amount":58.82,"local_amount":162.26,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":164.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488596,"comment":null},{"amount":61.21,"local_amount":168.86,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":171.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222204831,"comment":null},{"amount":62.1,"local_amount":171.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":174.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181557,"comment":null},{"amount":65.49,"local_amount":180.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":183.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232778606,"comment":null},{"amount":67.31,"local_amount":185.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":188.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583238,"comment":null},{"amount":69.17,"local_amount":190.82,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":193.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244541544,"comment":null},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":196.31,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":199.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752215,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T15:23:30Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:05:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":263559,"name":"Felicitas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicitas U. is from the village of Nuesa.

She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and pig-fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. \r\n\r\nHeide is  borrowing PHP 20000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nHeide aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

It is made up of 7 women members who all know each other and are neighbors. \r\n\r\nFlorida G. M. will invest her loan in the purchase of catalogues and merchandise to fill orders that have already been placed this season. \r\n\r\nRosenda D. Munoz will purchase hair dyes in various shades and of the Maginel and Magic Color brand names. She will also purchase a curling iron, and hair spray. \r\n\r\nPatricia O. V. will purchase a stove and a tank of gas, as well as a tub to cook corn on the cob.\r\n\r\nAlejandra F. A. will purchase a tricycle and a stove from where to sell corn on the cob.\r\n\r\nMaria Feliz C. S. will purchase dried roses, chrysanthemums, daisies, greens, cloves and vases. \r\n\r\nElizabeth C. S. will purchase glass vases, florists foam, gladiolas, chrysanthemums, roses, Acapulco flowers, lilacs, etc.\r\n\r\nIsabel S. N. will purchase paint, firewood, and soft drinks to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAlejandra F. A. is a member of the group. She is 27 years old and she has a grade 9 education. She lives with her boyfriend, a farmhand, and they have 2 children together: Candido is 8 years old and is in primary school, and Sergio is 2. She has a stand from where she sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and baked corn cakes. \r\n\r\nWith her loan she wishes to purchase a tricycle to sells her products, a stove and a tank of gas, as well as mayonnaise, and popsicle sticks.  She sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and corn cakes. \r\n\r\nAlejandra started her business 8 years ago following her aunts retirement from her business. She gave her the cooking tubs and sticks that she had and her mother loaned her some money to purchase corn and she also loaned her a stove.  Alejandra knew how to make corn drinks, prepared corn and corn cakes, as her mother taught her. She sells every day of the week from a wheelbarrow from 5pm to 7:30pm every evening through the streets of Tlayacapan.  She travels through all the streets of her town to sell her products. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her financially, especially when her husband is out of work and she is still able to buy food. She enjoys preparing the corn for sale and she is very proud because she is well known, especially for her corn cakes and corn drinks. They are very tasty and she always sells out. She tends to more than 50 customers every day. Her business is popular because everyone knows her cooking and they place orders. \r\n\r\nShe faces a challenge when the hot weather approaches and the sales drop. She also finds the competition a challenge. When she first started out she was the only one in the business and today there are many people who sell corn, prepared corn, and corn drinks. \r\n\r\nThe profits from the business will be used to reinvest in business, to pay off some debts, and to repay this loan. Her plan is to find a store from where she can be settled in to sell her product to avoid running the streets. \r\n\r\nTlayacapan is a tourist area that is visited by many travelers who wish to see the old convent and the mummies. They sell terra cotta pottery, and very ornate pots. There is also a very popular musical group named Santa Maria. \r\n\r\nHer business has helped her family when someone falls ill and she was also able to build a house with the help of her husband, who also contributed to the expenses and improvements. Her plans and dream for her children are to provide them with an education. Alejandra is very happy to receive this loan to establish her business as she dreams.  She will be able to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group wish to convey to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner) \"Thank you very much and we hope to keep accessing loans while we keep your trust. They are a great help to us in advancing our businesses\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":686801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a tricycle, a stove, a tank of gas, and ingredients.

She rents her home, and wants to grow her business so that she can buy land to achieve her dream of building her own house. She has been pursuing this business for 8 years.\r\n\r\nThe loans will be used to buy merchandise to diversify the products she sells.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":687986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

is a widow who lives in the municipality of Cordova in Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  making leather straps and a general store. \r\n\r\nFeliciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Feliciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly income of approximately $300, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses and for the renovation of their house. \r\n\r\nFeliciana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

a married mother of two children aged 9 and 12 years, lives in San Remegio, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two ventures:  a fishing business and a cosmetic dealership. Her husband Rizalito, 43, works as a laborer to earn his living.  <p>\r\n\r\nGenevee joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Genevee has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 10,300,  uplifting the family's standard of living. She is now requesting a new loan to provide capital for her fishing business and to purchase more cosmetics to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Genevee is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

58, lives in Medellin, Cebu where she earns her living by operating a fishing business. Her husband Jimmy, 58, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 11 children between the ages of 13 and 36 years old. Five of their children have their own families, while the other has her own job helping her parents to run the business. <p>\r\n\r\nEly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ely has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 11,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 to purchase a new engine and fishing gear for the fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of the business. Ely is a Dungganon woman  following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p> \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

a married mother of three children between the ages of 19 and 22, lives in San Remegio, Cebu, where she has two businesses:  a general store and a load retailer venture.  Her husband Renato F., 47, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.<p>\r\n\r\nEvelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy more groceries for the general store to resell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the children's education. Evelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures, a general store and a frozen products business. Her husband Tirzo, who is 39 years old, works as a company driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 7 to 10 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nRose joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rose has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 15000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for sale, so she can continue to save for future family expenses. Rose is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and buying and selling appliances\/jewelry. Her husband Efren, who is 58 years old, works as a market supervisor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children between 29 to 34 years old who already have families of their own. \r\n\r\nRebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 50,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 40,500, increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock for her rice retail and general store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion and improvement of her business. Rebecca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in San Remegio, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,600. Jenelie is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jenelie hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future. Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its programs, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With her focused approach, she has been able to achieve a lot, given that her business requires good relationship skills. In that regard she has not shortchanged herself. Notwithstanding the successes Monic has achieved, she has also had to grapple with a lot of financial challenges that have in many ways dampened the smooth running of her business.

Kurbonali is 40 years old, married, and has 8 children. He grows wheat and potatoes and sells them in the market for income. He has been working in this business for almost 5 years and has gained much experience. Kurbonali has a large family, considering that he is living with his parents. He works almost every day to generate revenue to support his family. Since his family relies on his crops, Kurbonali needs a loan to purchase necessary supplies for his current harvest. This will be his third loan with IMON International and his previous credit history shows he is qualified to receive the loan.   \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and has 5 children. He makes a living selling foodstuffs at his grocery store. His location is very good and he serves many customers because he is willing to work late. Ismoil has been in this business for 8 years and knows a good deal about it. He is also very punctual and detail-oriented, character traits that help him in his business. Ismoil can always figure out how much stock he needs so there is enough on hand to meet customer needs yet it is always fresh.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

As for his future plan, he wants all of his children to go to university and to get good jobs. \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She currently works from very early in the morning selling clothes, perfumes and cosmetics and a variety of merchandise that she buys and re-sells.  One of the difficulties that she sometimes has is that she needs to look after her children properly but can't because she is working, selling her merchandise.\r\n\r\nJanina would like to continue in her business and, for this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy cosmetics, perfumes and clothes.  She will also use some of the money to do some work on her premises, buying cement and paint.  In the future, she would like to own a general store and thereby improve her income so that she can provide her children with a better life.\r\n\r\n\r\n
