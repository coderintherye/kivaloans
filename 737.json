She has been in this business for over 10 years, and she works 6 days out of every week. Nulu sells her products from home.

In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and for methane production.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":942068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T04:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":30862.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865095,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-12T06:24:27Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369401,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is married with four children, all of whom graduated from school.

He works from home, providing video services, such as making videos, editing clips etc... Eduard has extensive experience working in several  TV studios. He has been in this business for 11 years. He has received positive reviews for his work, both from customers and from experts in the field.  His current net profit is 3,000 hryvnia.   Eduard receives a lot of orders, but he often has to turn down potential customers because he cannot make high-quality videos with the equipment he owns at the moment.  With the funds that he will receive from Kiva, Eduard is planning to purchase a professional Panasonic HDC-MDH-1 camcorder which he needs to make high-quality videos.  With this professional camcorder, Eduard will no longer lose good orders.  He will also bring additional income to his family and further develop his business.\r\n\r\n

She has a teenage daughter, who she raised all by herself. Vera lives in Ivano-Frankivsk. She is engaged in retail trade in perfumes, cosmetics and hygiene products. She has as many as three sales points around the city, six employees, and a separate warehouse for the goods. In the past, Vera worked as an English teacher. After her husband's passing she had to take over his business. Vera set relatively low prices for the whole range of products; her vending stalls are conveniently located throughout the city. She has been in this business for twenty years. Vera plans to invest the Kiva loan of 20 000 hryvnas in the purchase of perfumes. She would like to increase the assortment before the holidays. She will buy perfumes, eau-de-cologne,  hair dyes, etc. in order to meet the increasing demand before the New Year and Christmas holidays. Vera's goal is to finance her daughter's college education.\r\n\r\nNote: original text in

Also, for two years she has been offering a service from her own apartment renting washing machines to neighbors in her neighborhood and nearby.  With a frequency of daily sales and installments, she gets a profit margin of no less than 50%.\r\n\r\nShe started her enterprising idea when she bought her first DVD player.  With her friends and neighbors and a television set they would get together in her house and rent movies to watch.  This is how she asked her husband to put up the announcement of renting and selling movies, which has gone very well for her.  Later she added to her domestic clientele the service of renting washing machines, which she had known about through her mother's experience.  Her two businesses have allowed her to generate income, with which she has supported the well-being of her home.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first funding she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan she will buy two more washing machines, with which she will expand her potential for accessing the market and she will respond to her customers' demand, which often goes away unmet because her machines are busy in various areas of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nRosa has described herself as a person who likes to save.  This is why it was not difficult for her to get her first working capital and make her first investment in the entrepreneurship of her small business.\r\n\r\nToday she feels very satisfied and wants to continue the growth of her business.  For this reason she does her best in her daily work, because she is building her son's future and she wants him to have good educational possibilities, so he will have the potential to be successful in what he decides to undertake.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":60.18,"image":{"id":941702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy two more washing machines to expand her access to market potential.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":730000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55119},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54702},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55978},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57284},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58621},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59989},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61389},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62821},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64287},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65787},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67322},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66701}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.2,"local_amount":55119,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":58078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188789,"comment":null},{"amount":29.98,"local_amount":54702,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":57639.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324991,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T14:31:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369524,"name":"Yeimy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yeimy de 19 a\u00f1os es una joven muy emprendedora,  que tiene un hijo en la edad de 1 a\u00f1o,  con el que sue\u00f1a ver crecer lleno de bienestar y con las mejores condiciones de vida, que ella en  su inagotable esfuerzo,  pueda ofrecerle.

He finished a secondary school in the Sevakar village, and then, after finishing school, was accepted and graduated from the Kapan Mining College, where he obtained a profession of an electrician.  Currently, Donik works an electrician.  Donik is married and has four children: three sons and a daughter.  His daughter and oldest son already have their own families and live separately from the parents.  The middle and youngest sons live with the parents.  Parallel to his electrician work, Donik has been involved in agriculture for almost 20 years.  He has a small plot of land in the Sevakar village, where he grows vegetables and fruits and breeds cattle and chickens.  Donik sells his agricultural products in the city of Kapan.  His wife and two sons help Donik with the agricultural business, thanks to which they support the family and provide it daily with the necessary, fresh products.  Donik needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram to purchase two cows and three calves, which would help him to increase his family's income in the future.  This is Donik's third loan from the Nor Horizon organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125.77,"image":{"id":943045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two cows and three calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20690},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26930},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28280},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27770},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":28200},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29060},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29490},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29520},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":29970},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30060},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":31600},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":31710},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":31540},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":32650},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33720},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":32810},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34640},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":34390},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":34690},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35860},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35990},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":36540},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37260},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37810},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38250},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38830},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":39670},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":39970},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40730},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41370}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.65,"local_amount":20819.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20935.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263723,"comment":null},{"amount":71.12,"local_amount":27094.6,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":27245.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404914,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-27T20:56:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369600,"name":"Marlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlita is a married woman with two children.

is Editha, 46, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines. Her husband is Rodrigo, her business partner, and a father to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEditha operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

In 2003, while looking for income source for her family, Zinat started her own business in raising livestock with the initial investment of 10,000 KGS. Because of her perseverance and persistence, she currently owns 4 cows, 8 sheep, 8 goats and is earning around 7,000 KGS per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. The income from this business allowed Zinat to pay for her children's education and do small repairs in her house. In order to further develop her business, Zinat came to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 55,000 KGS to purchase sheep.  In the future Zinat wants to increase her property and expand her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.12,"image":{"id":943217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kuyruchuk village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zinat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2686},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2587},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2652},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2718},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2786},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2856},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2927},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3075},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3152},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3231},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3312},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3395},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3480},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3567},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3656},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3396}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.6,"local_amount":2686,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2728.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722539,"comment":null},{"amount":55.07,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2564.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125475,"comment":null},{"amount":56.45,"local_amount":2587,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2628.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250630,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T20:56:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369740,"name":"Peres","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peres is 30 year old a married woman with four children; three of them are in school.

They work in different open market fairs, and they all belong to the municipality of Colina.\r\n\r\nIrma is president of the community bank. In the photo she is standing in the front row, second from left to right, and wearing a shirt with red, white and calypso (aquamarine) horizontal stripes. She is active in retail trading, specifically selling fruits and vegetables at various open markets in her community. She also sells crafts from the village of Pomaire.\r\n\r\nShe started in the business at an early age as most of her family are merchants. She has a fruit and vegetable stand she runs jointly with her husband and a stand for clay handicrafts, which she acquires from a craftsman in Pomaire.\r\n\r\nShe works from Tuesday to Sunday at three different market fairs and soon expects to join a fourth market located in the center of town. At this time of year she is also involved in the town's Christmas market which is scheduled in the evenings.\r\n\r\nWith a credit loan to buy merchandise for her business, she will stock up on crafts for the Christmas season, mainly to sell manger scenes showing the Holy Family. Her business goals are to become an established merchant, and be able to work independently with formal standing in a more permanent structure.\r\n\r\nIrma lives with her husband, her mother-in-law and her young daughter Daniela, who is only three years old and is her prime motivator for success. She says her biggest dream is related to the purchase of her own home. This will enable her to strengthen her family and solidify her business, in a way that allows her to see her daughter grow and actively participate in her education.\r\n\r\nHer main motivation with relation to her business is to become established as a micro-entrepreneur, improve her family's condition, and leave an inheritance to her daughter.\r\n\r\nHer experience with Hope Fund highlights the usefulness of financing at this time of year. She found interesting the opportunity to participate in meetings and training within the institution, so as to receive comprehensive support.\r\n\r\nColina is a community in the metropolitan area north of Santiago (the capital of Chile).

who are eight, six and three years old, and the youngest daughter is seven months old.  Uulkelsin is a teacher and spent four years working at a kindergarten.  Currently, being on a maternity leave, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, which allows her to cover some of her family's expenses.  Thanks to Uulkelsin's persistent work, today her business contains two dairy cows and twenty sheep.  Uulkelsin also works on 1.44 hectares of land, where she grows beans, potatoes and multi-year herbs.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a heifer.  Uulkelsin plans to invest the profits into increasing her livestock headcount further and dreams of buying a car for the family in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":215,"image":{"id":943234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uulkelsin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125476,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T07:10:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369754,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is a 30-year-old married woman with one child who is not in school.

","en":"Nancy has a business selling snacks prepared with corn dough, a very natural product.  She sells at a place close to her house.  It is located to the southwest of the city where she lives with her husband and their three children, who range in age from six to eight.\r\n\r\nShe has devoted herself to this business activity since 2007 when a friend lent her the capital to start it.  She used the money to buy equipment and working tools, and she started selling on the corner of her neighborhood on the week-ends.  At first she sold \u201cdeditos\u201d (finger cookies) and empanadas.  \r\n\r\nShe was gradually becoming well-known in the neighborhood, and the business was growing as well as her dream of having more customers.  She found them when she traveled to a place very close to the hospital in an adjacent neighborhood.  There are regular customers there who consume her products.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to manage to get a new sales location in order to generate more income simultaneously.  That is the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan, her first with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use her loan to buy the ingredients and supplies to make the products.  She will sell them in a well-known commercial corridor, which has the potential for immediate sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house.  That is why she works very carefully day to day in order to fulfill her dream.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":73.55,"image":{"id":939979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and supplies to make food products and to sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T14:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":65395},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74699},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76442},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78225},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80050},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81918},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83830},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85786},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87787},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89836},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91932},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":104100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":65395,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":66021.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188792,"comment":null},{"amount":39.22,"local_amount":74699,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":75414.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324994,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T13:08:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369764,"name":"Maame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maame sells plastic bowls and baskets at Besease.

","en":"Mildred, 42, has two businesses that she runs out of an Internet caf\u00e9.  She sells a wide range of women's, men's and children's articles and accessories for the home.  Her shop is located in a neighborhood southwest of the city, where she lives with her husband and two children, ages 19 and 22.  She began this activity in 2002 with savings.  Between 2002 and 2006 she worked as a merchant and in 2006 bought her first computer and an elegant display cabinet, and business began to grow through reinvestments.  She now has five computers and three cabinets in a very organized, well-appointed shop of which she is very proud.  Her dream is to expand her business because in the future she would like to turn it into a large clothing store with a lot of variety.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is having enough working capital and responding to customer demand, especially in times when there is a lot of activity such as Christmas and New Year's eve.  This is why she has requested a Credikiva loan, her first one through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.
