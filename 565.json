With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Johaima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and house repairs.

Jermelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":731461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more stock to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Narra, Palawan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-03-25T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jermelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6033.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201332530,"comment":null},{"amount":138,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6033.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206200202,"comment":null},{"amount":184,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":8044.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211273983,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216554045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-25T19:28:42Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:36:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283079,"name":"Ket","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"From the province of Kompong Cham, Ket S. has been in the farming business for years.

They have eight children who are between 10 and 31 years old. \n\nLilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase rice to sell and fertilizer for her farming operation so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of business. Liberty is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":732155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase rice to sell and fertilizer for her farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Narra, Palawan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-03-22T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liberty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3016.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201332540,"comment":null},{"amount":69,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3016.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206200212,"comment":null},{"amount":92,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4022.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211273992,"comment":null},{"amount":115,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5027.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216554054,"comment":null},{"amount":92,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4022.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221722705,"comment":null},{"amount":92,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4022.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227093156,"comment":null},{"amount":46,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232854559,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

is a 54-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a vegetable garden. She lives in the municipality of Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her vegetable garden business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Luzviminda is borrowing PHP 24,000 to purchase fertilizers and seeds for her vegetable garden.  This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

They have four children who are between 18 and 31 years old. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to purchase pigs and feed so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

M. is from the town of Naguillan, Isabela. She is 45 years old. Carolina is married and has six school-aged children. Carolina owns and operates a piggery. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Carolina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, Carolina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Carolina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Carolina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She started operating this business after the death of her husband a few years ago. Now the business is well established as Ruqqiya has a good number of clients in her community who buy milk from her due to the milk's freshness and good quality. She is hopeful that by purchasing another buffalo, her business will grow due to increased productivity of milk and her ability to serve more clients. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Pablo, who is 59 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 31 and 36 years old. Nelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.

By working hard in her general store and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Merlita is borrowing PHP 11,000 to buy more merchandise to sell in her general store and ingredients for her food vending business. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Merlita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future he wants to expand his business with his fascination in the crops area. He likes micro-lending organization IMON because repeat clients have reduced interest rates and commission. Shokhrukh would like to get a loan of 12000 Somoni for purchasing onion and melon seeds, and mineral fertilizers which will help him expand his business.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a married woman who lives in Narra, Palawan.

Her husband Diosdado, who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 17 and 25 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000 to pay for the overhead expenses of her quarrying operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and the future expansion of her business. Rebecca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Lucena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000 to purchase more used clothing stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs, buy home appliances, and save up to increase her revolving capital.

This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to purchase more stock to sell both for her home products business and for the sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for her future security and to support her household expenses.

She lives in her own house with her husband Erasmo, 63, and their two daughters. The elder daughter works and studies.\r\n\r\nFor many years Santa sold baby clothes, either by walking through the streets or setting up on the edge of the market. But nine years ago, with a lot of effort and with help from her husband, this enterprising woman was able to get a stall in a market that was not very crowded and did not have enough capital to invest. But with time, and thanks to great patience and dedication, today the market is very popular. Because of this Santa is now established as a businesswoman, and because she sells her merchandise on credit she has been able to grow little by little.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in this business for 9 years and is pleased about her work. Now that she has a little more capital, her business has gotten much better. For this reason, Santa is sure that by working very persistently she will eventually be able to expand and have more stock. To do this she needs to buy a variety of baby clothes and other gifts to diversify her business.\r\n\r\nHer communal bank has four members, and they have all shown that they are responsible. This is how they have earned their tenth loan with MFP, and they confirm their promises to make their payments punctually. With the loan she is asking for, Santa will buy more clothes to stock her business and continue to develop it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":734195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothing and meet customer demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-21T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":189.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":195.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.32,"local_amount":160.37,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":161.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196404,"comment":null},{"amount":62.25,"local_amount":171.2,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270085,"comment":null},{"amount":65.15,"local_amount":179.17,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":180.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550103,"comment":null},{"amount":68.84,"local_amount":189.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":190.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718778,"comment":null},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":195.7,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":196.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350231,"comment":null},{"amount":74.28,"local_amount":204.26,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":205.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-23T08:55:32Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283288,"name":"Zurab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zurab S. is 51 years old and lives with his big family in the villageof Shalauri, Kakheti Region.

With the profits that he has made, he has managed to gradually build his home and adapt some rooms.  He saw how profitable it would be to rent out rooms and so he has been renting out these spaces in his home for the past 12 years.  This has been very profitable for him.\r\n\r\nRolando invests all the profits that he makes in doing work to his house, for example, connecting water, installing light and installing bathrooms.  He does all this for the well-being of his tenants.  He tries to make his tenants comfortable so that they stay in his house longer, though many of them damage his property and he has to make necessary repairs.  In the future, he plans to set up a business since his age and health problems do not allow him to work at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis is Rolando's tenth loan from MFP and he says that he can be trusted to make all his repayments responsibly.

For the past fifteen years he has been working in agriculture and in the raising of young animals. He has a lot of land, which he has used to build a guinea pig farm. He cares for his animals everyday. He also has extensive lands that he uses to raise and harvest alfalfa. Alfalfa provides feed for his animals. The extra alfalfa he sells. His wife helps him care for the other products that he grows, which include potatoes, corn, quinoa, and vegetables. He considers his animal farm profitable, as he has contact with buyers that frequently buy his animals. Nevertheless, he would like to develop this activity as it allows him to improve his quality of life. He is always looking to see which crop is profitable, as he wants to recoup the cost of each harvest season.

She\u2019s in a common law marriage, finished middle school, is a merchant and has two children who are 7 and 10 years of age. Her husband works in the fields.\r\n\r\nSeeing the lack of employment stability she decided to start a business to support her economy and her children\u2019s quality of life.  She started selling groceries two years ago and needs the loan to buy groceries and increase sales. Isabel mentioned to us the responsibility that belonging to an institution like ours represents.  \r\n\r\nThis photo was taken at Leticia T.\u2019s house.  She is group Treasurer of the group that\u2019s located in the State of Hidalgo.  The group has 9 members and in the photo a group of unified women can be seen smiling because of the support provided because, without it, probabilities of growth are very limited.

She also sells new clothes\r\n\r\nAlicia started out in the craft trade 10 years ago which means that her frequent customers are long-standing and responsible.  She sells her crafts and clothes door to door.  Alicia buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago since the prices there are better for her business.  \r\n\r\nAlicia lives with her husband and her 10 year-old grandson who she has cared for since he was born because her daughter went off to work in another city and didn't take responsibility for him as his mother.  For this reason, Alicia has had to raise and educate her grandson.  This is her motivation to continue in her business: she would like to provide her grandson with a better quality of life and an education.  She will use her loan to buy clothes for the winter season.\r\n\r\nAlicia's dream is to own a car in order to distribute her merchandise to more rural areas.  Right now, she transports her products on a bicycle.  However, during the winter, this task becomes difficult because of the cold and rain in the city.  With a car, she would be able to increase her customer base and, consequently, her profits.\r\n\r\nAlicia is very grateful and happy to be working with Fondo Esperanza.  She really enjoys the group meetings because the other entrepreneurs are all responsible.  Alicia is the community bank's representative.  As regards the loans that she receives through Fondo Esperanza, they have been a great support for her business since they have enabled her to invest and increase her income.\r\n\r\nCasablanca is a town which is located in Valpara\u00edso province, in the region of the same name.

Because Villarica is a tourist area, which is favorable, Jorge rents his house to toursits during the two months of the summer season (January and February).

Regretably, his business went bankrupt.  Nevertheless, in spite of that bad experience, his dream is to once again have a confections distribution company, which would afford him job stability.  Consequently, he is motivated to continue with his businesses, since that is the way to obtain the greatest earnings and have a better quality of life.\r\nJorge lives with his wife and his 22 year-old daughter.\r\nHe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza.

He tells us that during this time of crisis, the person who helped with the household expenses was his wife.  She makes her living selling guinea pigs and pigs.  First she feeds them, and when they reach a specific weight, they are sold in the wholesale market in the city.  She earns 400 PEN per sale.  Arturo's main problem is the monthly expense of the school his daugther attends.  Because of that expense and because he is not currently working, he is planning to get into the business of making health food with the mill that he has.  He wants to make quinoa, maca (a radish-like root), soy and other flours.  Arturo belongs to the communal bank \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d, and this is his third loan with MFP, with which he hopes to make his plans into reality.  Arturo will take the first step for his business by investing the loan in the purchase of corn by the kilo to start working and processing it on his mill."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":734405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase corn by the kilo to process and make into corn flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-21T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1038,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T18:08:28Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":283396,"name":"Mujeres Luchadoras 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maricela\u00b4s story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activities are a free trading zone, a cement factory, and others. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. \r\n\r\nMaricela is the coordinator of her group, Mujeres Luchadoras 1 (Fighting Women). She makes her home in a simple structure with her long-term partner and six children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to build a house. Now she pays rent. She operates a miscellaneous product store (general store). \r\n\r\nMaricela is excited to take out her fourth loan through Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan to help grow her business. She has been in business for almost 16 years. Maricela plans to use this loan to buy clothes like pants and t-shirts, cosmetics, shoes, and especially women's apparel.\r\n\r\nShe will use her profits to save for her future home.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Precy M. Group.\r\n\r\nPrecy is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Precy runs a general store where she sells a variety of products in the local community. Precy has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Precy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Precy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Precy is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Precy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They all work hard to support their families. The following paragraphs detail the different businesses activities of each member:\r\n\r\nGumercina Gonz\u00e1les Su\u00e1rez owns a mill for grinding maize. The maize flour is used to make tortillas, rosquillas (ring-shaped pastries), and nacatamales (steamed meat and vegetable-filled tamales wrapped in maize or banana leaf). She has many loyal customers because of the good customer service she provides. With the profit earned from her business, Gumercina helps her husband pay for household expenses. The couple have a beautiful daughter together. This loan will be used to purchase spare parts to maintain the mill.\r\n\r\nMaria Victorina B. is a small retailer, selling cosmetics, new and used clothing, and silver jewelry. She sells most of her products on Saturdays and Sundays, when she collects money from customers who have purchased items on credit. Maria takes advantage of the weekends to make additional sales. With her business income she pays for household expenses. Maria is a single mother and has to work very hard to take care of her family. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise so that she can stock a better selection and meet the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nElvin Oswaldo A. L. buys and sells staple grains. He buys during the harvest when the price is low and later retails the grain at a higher price. With his business profit he pays for household expenses. His wife works in a cigarette factory, which allows her to earn enough money to improve the family's living conditions. The loan will be used to buy grains because the local price is currently very low and this will give Elvin a better profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":734746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase spare parts for mill, clothing, cosmetics, silver jewelry, beans, maize, and rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2011-04-07T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gumercinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvin Oswaldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295767,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216575676,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221745388,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T08:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227718386,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232876629,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238693316,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244649316,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-20T09:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251598442,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by buying and selling fruit and food vending. Her husband Gregorio, who is 64 years old, is a retired employee and now helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 13 and 38 years old. \n\nLourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \n\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase fruit so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of business.

Gladys joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gladys has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase a sidecar so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

is a married woman who lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying & selling fruits & vegetables and pig fattening. Her husband Roberto, who is 61 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 10 children who are between 14 and 41 years old. Eva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

Hong is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 34. Thi Tran. Thieu Hoa (12.13.34).\n\nHong is married and has one school-aged child. \n\nTo making a living, Hong operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock, primarily cattle, for sale. Hong has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month.\n\nIn 2011, Hong joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation.  Hong is requesting for the first time a loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,787,900 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Hong plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1. Phung Thi Ngan (10) is a 36-year-old woman who is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\n2. Nguyen Thi Nghia (9) is a 39 year-old female who is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nH\u1ed3ng L. th\u1ecb T.
