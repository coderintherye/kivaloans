53, is a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Nonito, a salesman, and has three children. Together they manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEufemia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEufemia hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":895009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" To pay for grocery items and products needed for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-20T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3469.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571868,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2312.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529418,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738634,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":577.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145862,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T00:08:56Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":346655,"name":"Elma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elma is 45 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is married to Cleto, a jeepney driver, and the mother to their four children. Three of them are already working while the other one is in high school. By the grace of God, Rosana has managed to support her child's schooling. Rosana is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosana oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment in their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nRosana dreams that her child will finish her education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n---Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

Jorge is 27 years old.  He requests a loan to invest in his business selling eggs at wholesale and retail. He makes his sales from his house, and also in an itinerant manner.  He has had this business for 6 years.  Mariela is 28 years old and has a business selling handicrafts.  She buys her products in the market and sells from place to place.  She started up this business 2 years ago; her relatives helped her  by contributing the startup capital so that she could get the business going.  She also received help from other merchants who had experience in this line of work.  Ana Patricia has a business selling nacatamales (a traditional Nicaraguan tamal), beans and soup.  Her menu varies daily in order to accommodate the demands of her customers.  Her main challenge is to buy equipment for the business.  At this time, she does not have this equipment and so she uses utensils from her house.  She started this business with the help of her father, who set aside working capital so that she would be able to work and get ahead, since in this country it is difficult to find work.  Francisco has a business selling eggs from place to place, and also from his house.  He requests this new loan to invest in his business and stock it with more eggs; the loan will also allow him to make a big purchase and obtain a discount that he could not get if he buys the eggs at retail. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":567.21,"image":{"id":895297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2011-10-15T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco Filadelfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":3083.38,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3126.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244566394,"comment":null},{"amount":150.95,"local_amount":3384.9,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3431.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251670227,"comment":null},{"amount":138.63,"local_amount":3108.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3151.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257564003,"comment":null},{"amount":140.13,"local_amount":3142.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263322160,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T21:11:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":346872,"name":"Zoraida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Zoraida est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer su peque\u00f1a tienda de abarrotes y desea comprar por ejemplo sacos de arroz, sacos de az\u00facar, tarros de leche, menestras y otras cosas m\u00e1s.

He is an agriculturist following a family tradition, cultivating up to 14000 square meters of land. Vidal learned this business from his parents. Normally he cultivates corn to secure the family's nutrition. The amount which he sells is small to cover nutrition and clothing expenses. To sell the harvest, Vidal transports the corn on his back, traveling approximately 800 meters.\r\n\r\nVidal has requested a loan from Fundacion Campo (Kiva Field Partner) to purchase a pump and PVC tubing to install an artesian style irrigation system. With a part of this loan Vidal also wants to purchase vegetable seeds to start a home garden. With the irrigation system and the plantation, Vidal will be able to product even during the dry season, no longer having to depend on his work as a farm hand. He will also be able to provide vegetables for his family and improve their nutrition.\r\n\r\nVidal is a leader in his community. He is currently presiding over a cooperative for agriculturists. The objective of the cooperative is to organize agriculturists, to purchase materials together, to sell their harvests, and to partake in technical assistance. The technical assistance is received by agricultural technicians provided by an NGO. In the region where Vidal lives, which is alongside a river, no agriculturist products other products apart from corn and millet.

Given his parents' limited financial resources he was not able to stay in school. He only has a basic level of education. He has two brothers, and older and a younger. His father is the owner of a blacksmith shop and his mother is a housewife. This young entrepreneur started out working with his father in the shop and he got to know many people when he saw the opportunity to set up his own car wash business, given the number of vehicles that passed daily through the region. He started out this business 3 years ago and space where his business is established belongs to his father.\n\nHe started out his business with his own funds and for the first time he is requesting a loan. The loan will be used to purchase vehicle accessories (oils, car fresheners, etc.) and to repair his steam cleaning machine. The business is managed by himself and by his brother. They open their business at 6:00 in the morning and the finish at 6:00 in the evening. The location of the business is appropriate because it is found on a coastal road and the flux of vehicles is very good. There is only one other car wash in the region. Young Saul's goal is to attend to a larger number of clients and to provide complementary services such as the sale of accessories. Currently people only come to wash their car and they go to the other business (the competition) to buy their accessories. The other limiting factor is that he can only do the body wash.

In this way, they will improve their living conditions. In the future he wants to expand his house and construct it with brick, as currently it is made of sheet metal.

Con la ayuda del pr\u00e9stamo Neftali ha podido comprar todo los insumos que necesita de una sola ves, adquiriendolos a mejor precio y ahorrandose el costo de tener que hacer varios viajes.\n\nEn un futuro Neftali quisiera poder sembrar una mayor cantidad, y poder obtener mayores cosechas para la venta.\n","en":"Neftali is 47 years old, married, and he has a son. Neftali started out in agriculture when he was 12 years old. He learned the business from his father, who, for the sake of teaching his son to work, did not let Neftali go to school. Therefore Neftali has 35 years' experience as an agriculturist, and he loves what he does.\r\n\r\nNeftali has requested a loan from Fundacion Campo (Kiva Field Partner) to invest in the 10500 square meters of land where he cultivates corn and beans. The region where Neftali lives is very rural so transportation is very limited. Neftali's challenge is transporting all of the materials to his land. With the help of this loan Neftali has been able to purchase all of the materials he needs all at once, obtaining a better price and saving on the cost of making several trips.\r\n\r\nIn the future Neftali would like to plant in larger quantities to increase his harvests for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.28,"image":{"id":895487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers for the 10,500 square meters of farmland where he cultivates corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-11-01T07:01:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neftali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.21,"local_amount":78.21,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562734,"comment":null},{"amount":39.98,"local_amount":39.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":39.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773863,"comment":null},{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":41.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182444,"comment":null},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":41.89,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T21:03:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":346972,"name":"Enith Adelaida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Enith es socia del banco comunal las Almendras del Distrito Calleria, Departamento de Ucayali, tiene  65 a\u00f1os de edad y 11 hijos, solo 1 a su cargo, los dem\u00e1s ya tiene sus respectivas familias.\nTiene una vulcanizadora  que funciona en su casa y su hijo es el que trabaja ah\u00ed, lleva tres a\u00f1os trabajando con Manuela Ramos y est\u00e1 contenta porque hizo nuevas amistades y  se siente contenta por trabajar con ese banco comunal.\nCon su nuevo pr\u00e9stamo de  S\/. 1,000.00 nuevos soles comprara:   una plancha de parches, un litro de pegamento,  1 docena de c\u00e1maras, cuando las c\u00e1maras est\u00e1n muy picadas es mejor que sus clientes compren c\u00e1mara nueva  y para darles facilidad va vender las c\u00e1maras.\nSaca sus pr\u00e9stamos de acuerdo a las necesidades que tiene porque no quiere quedar mal con Manuela Ramos porque quiere seguir trabajando por mucho tiempo m\u00e1s.\n","en":"Se\u00f1ora Enith is a member of Las Almendras Community Bank in Calleria district in the department of Ucayali.

She lives with her three children: a 19-year old daughter who is studying commerce at a technical school; another daughter, 16 years old who is in high school. And a 12-year old son who is in grade five.\r\n\r\nAs a family tradition they buy and raise pigs. They are purchased as piglets and they raise them and sell them when they have grown. She carries out her business from a space on the property. Given the financial needs of her family and the fact that raising pigs does not permit them to have a steady source of income, she decided 8 years ago to sell fashion jewelry and cosmetics by catalogue. This business has permitted her family to live in a dignified manner and to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nTo feed her pigs, she buys the whey that is produced from cow milk when it is processed. And she busy every day from the daily producers in the region. The concentrated feed is purchased from the city, located 25 kilometers from her home. She uses public buses to transport her products and then she pays a pick-up truck service to take her products all the way to her house from the bus stop. She makes her purchases once per week, especially because the product loses its quality if bought in larger volumes. The jewelry and the cosmetics are also purchased in the city.\r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to keep raising her 20 pigs, which are 6 weeks old. She needs to feed her sows and a boar. The other part of her loan will be used to purchase more and new products for resale. This will let Ruth continue with her income generating activities for the support of her family.
