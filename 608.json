She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling jewelry. She intends to use the loan capital to purchase rings, chains, bracelets, and other jewels. She will use the profits to save, complete construction on her home, and invest in her children's education. \r\n\r\nHer story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. She thanks you all for your support.

He has eight years of experience in this field and is a hard worker. Hassan was too young when he started working, but he had to assist his parents in earning a living to support the family. He worked in a chicken slaughterhouse at the beginning and eventually opened his own business. \r\n\r\nHassan is requesting a loan from Al Majmoua in order to buy a grill and a special shawarma cooking machine. A shawarma (\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627\u200e in Arabic) is a traditional Arab sandwich-like wrap of shaved lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, or beef, or a mixture thereof. The meat is placed on a spit and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shawarma is a popular food staple across the Arab world and is enjoyed in Palestine, Europe, and the Caucasus. Shawarma is eaten with pita bread, lavash bread, tabbouleh salad, fattoush salad, taboon bread, tomato, and cucumber. Toppings include tahini, hummus, pickled turnips, and amba. Shawarma is shared by many countries and includes a number of variations. In Greece, it is called gyros, meaning \"turned.\" In Armenian, it is tarna, literally meaning \"to turn,\" and in Turkish it is called d\u00f6ner kebab, which in turn means \"turning kebab.\" Indeed, the word shawarma (pronounced \/\u0283\u0259\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0rm\u0259\/) comes from the Turkish word \u00e7evirme [t\u0283evi\u027e\u02c8me], meaning \"turning.\"\r\n\r\nHassan is sure that this loan will increase his income by attracting new customers.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International:\r\n \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Approximately 10 years ago, Ganijon rented a place that had terrible conditions and was very deteriorated, and it was there that he started his business. He improved the space and expanded his grocery, and now it is one of the most popular groceries in his community. He has proven his belief that a person can reach his goals little by little through perseverance and dedication. Thanks to his skills and strengths, and fueled by the desire to provide a better future for his family, he moved from being a simple salesman to becoming his own boss. \r\n\r\nGanijon is requesting a loan of 8,000 Somoni to increase the inventory of foodstuff items in his grocery store. Ganijon is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push himself to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International:\r\n \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land.

A year ago she decided that her best option for earning an income was to have her own hardware business in a rented stall where she also lives, and together with her husband, they deal with the customers.  Her husband gets supplies of new merchandise since there is always a rotation of working capital.  Now prices of many of the products that they sell are stable.  In the short time that they have had their business sales have been increasing with the new products that they have decided to sell, like sand, and river stones that are necessary for house contstruction.  A personal invitation was extended to them to request financing and help with their cash problems since their business always requires an amount of money to replenish their merchandise and improve it.  This is the first loan with MFP and she feels more relaxed to have found a source of trustworthy financing and assistance to succeed with her financial goals.  That is why Elisabet is hoping that each one of you will help her with her plans.  \r\n She will use this money to buy more buckets of paint and sand

Their relationship has resulted in three children who live with them in their own home in the city of Quimbiri.  Adela is a person who works hard at her business of buying and selling local products such as cacao, coffee, annatto, and kindling.  She operates her business with her beloved husband, who is in charge of loading the merchandise despite the large amounts of each product that they sell.

Since Adela treats them well and offers them a good price, they in return do not hesitate to supply her with large quantities of their crops.  She has been in this business for seven years and has worked with great enthusiasm and dedication.  Adela saw this as a great opportunity to generate her own income so that she could provide for the welfare of her family and her children\u2019s education.  However, she does not have sufficient capital to acquire more products.  For this reason, she has returned to ask for additional loans provided by MFP.

Adela commits to submitting her payments by the deadlines indicated because she wants to access additional loans in the future.  In her Communal Bank, she is a member who supports ideas that will help move her group forward.  The loan she is requesting will be used as capital for buying the crops that are produced by the farmers.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":785653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","use":"to purchase cacao and coffee beans in bulk from local producers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-12T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T16:37:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":304853,"name":"Zoriano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoriano es un padre de familia de 38 a\u00f1os,  vive en su casa  propia con su esposa e hijos, ubicada en el distrtito de T\u00facume, que pertenece al departamento de la Lambayeque.

Growing up in the village of Tup, she defined her future profession early in childhood. Gulmira received a degree in engineering and works as an engine-driver assistant in a cement plant. \r\n\r\nGulmira has four children. Nothing went wrong until the day when she lost her husband. Then, as the only breadwinner, she had to find ways of supporting the family financially. Three years ago she and her oldest son spent their small savings on the purchase of a very first calf. Since then cattle-breeding and reselling brings in at least 2,000 soms a month to the family budget. \r\n\r\nGulmira, as well as other members of her group, needs financial assistance for a further broadening of the business. Therefore they rely on Kiva lenders. Gulmira plans to spend her own part on the purchase of one more calf for fattening and resale. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Maksatbu also wasn\u2019t lucky enough to get educated and work for the sake of society. However, eight years ago she made an important decision, and, thanks to that, her life took a different direction. She rented a small space in a nearby market and stocked it with a variety of consumer goods to sell. Maksatbu values the quality of the product much more than its price. She realized that she was right when more and more customers got attracted to her unique goods of a high quality. \r\n\r\nThe initial capital was 30,000 soms, which was alot for Maksatbu eight years ago. Nevertheless, she managed the business well and receives a profit of 10,000 soms monthly. She hopes to increase the goods circulation in the near future. \r\n\r\nThe loan from Kiva will help her increase her range of goods and help her purchase an automobile from the generated profit. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).
