is a widower who lives in Brgy. San Pablo, Manapla, Negros Occidental. He earns his living by operating 3 businesses: sugarcane hauling, rice retailing and dry goods sales. He has 4 children between the ages of 22 and 35. Federico joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because he hoped for something better for his family. With the help of his past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through his own efforts, Federico has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty. \r\n\r\n<p>Federico's previous loan of PHP 2,500 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for his 9th loan, he is borrowing PHP 25,000, which he intends to use to pay for spare truck parts and to fund his other businesses so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his rice and dry goods businesses. Federico B. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a food vending business. Her husband, Rolando V., who is 58 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living.  They have four children who are 22 to  29 years old. Teofreda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teofreda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: the selling of chicken barbeque, a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Nilo, who is 31 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have two children who are 8 and 12 years old. Ma. Louella joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Louella has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000, with which she intends to purchase additional stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and for home repairs. Ma. Louella is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   soft drinks dealer, cosmetics products and transport businesses. Her husband Bamberto, who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living .  They have three children who are between 12 to 14 years old. Monaliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Monaliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, with which she intends to buy stock of soft drinks and cosmetics to sell so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Monaliza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Narra, Palawan. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. \r\n\r\n<p>Teresita's previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,600, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she will use to buy stocks of vegetables and spices to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements. Teresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Mr. Vey S. is the village bank president, who has been selected by the other members.  The members will use their portions of the loan for different purposes to improve their families' living situations. Mr. Vey S. is a farmer who owns a half-hectare plot of land where he cultivates rice to sell to support his family. His wife, Mrs. Sok Koev Loem, is a seamstress in a garment factory. This couple supports four children: two are enrolled in the local public schoO., but the others are too young to work or study. Although they work hard, they earn only a small income. So Mr. Vey S. is asking for a loan to buy some piglets for breeding to start a new business.  With the rest of the loan he will fix his motorbike and rebuild his kitchen.

She is hopeful that an increased profit will help her save money for that purpose. Nagina is a regular lender with Asasah and this is her 4th loan application.

She earns her living by operating 2 businesses: a butcher shop and a mini-pharmacy. Her husband, Jerry, 45 years old, earns his living as a vendor. This couple has 3 children who are between 12 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\n<p>Diana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Diana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy various meats, sausages and chicken so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Diana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 60-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 businesses: buying and selling charcoal and firewood and a peanut butter business. She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nPacita has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her charcoal and firewood and peanut butter businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12000. \r\n\r\nPacita is  borrowing PHP 10000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 20 cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Pacita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Corte, Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store business.  Her husband Roque, who is 37 years old, works as a painter to earn his living.  They have four children from 5 to 11 years old. \r\n\r\nEliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,100, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to add more stocks for her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nEliza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a fishing and fish selling business. Her husband Felipe, who is 52 years old, works as a fisherman to support his family. They have 8 children who are between 14 and 28 years old. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, Josephine is borrowing PHP 10000, which she intends to use to purchase fishing materials and to maintain fishing equipment, so that she can continue to save up for future needs and for her children\u2019s education. Josephine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two businesses: furniture making and an eatery. Her husband, Decembert, 36 years old, earns his living as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children, aged 10 months to 12 years old, 3 of whom currently attend school. \r\n\r\n<p>Edna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Edna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more materials so that she can continue to save up for the future. Edna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today, he is seeking a way to expand his farming efforts in order to support his family, which consists of his wife and 5 children. Tilibboy faces lack of capital financing for the production of potatoes, wheat and oats. For this reason, he trustfully approached IMON to ask for a loan for that activity. In this way, he can continue supporting his humble home and develop his business economically.    \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His parents taught him how to get by as an agriculturist and he learned very well. Now that he is the father of 4 children, he still works as an agriculturalist. Thanks to his parents, Bahodur has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer. He hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can provide his loved ones with a more promising life. \r\n\r\nDespite being a good agriculturalist and hard-worker, he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan to  buy more of the seeds and fertilizers that he needs, which are very expensive. But without them, his production will not improve. You can help Bahodur keep moving forward with his development plans.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bibisoida is a mother of 4 children. She is a very honorable and resolute woman. Ever since she was a young she learned the honest work of raising the cattle, knowledge she has passed downed to her own children who have also managed to improve their quality of life. Bibisoida and her husband started their livestock business with only one cow. After a number of sacrifices they were able to increase little by little the quantity of calves. At the moment, with the support of their children, they have started to produce milk. They sell these on the weekends in their village. Currently Bibisoida wants to expand her business and to purchase more cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by selling ready-to-wear (RTW) clothes and other home products. Her husband Armando, who is 57 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 15 to 31 years old. Two of her children have their own families, three are working to help support the family and the two youngest children are currently going to school. Rita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She earns her living by buying and selling spices. Her husband Galilio, who is 55 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are between 12 and 36 years old. Aida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to save up for the future security of her family and business.

Aida is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Jovelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jovelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her business activities to save up for future business expansion and financial security for herself and her husband.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and kitchen utensils buy and sell businesses. Her husband Dioberto, who is 38 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 6 to 17 years old. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy feed for the pigs and more kitchen utensils to resell to save up for her children's future education. Evangeline is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

is a widow who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buy and sell \"balut\" (fertilized duck eggs) and a general store. Her children are all adults.  Josefina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use for more funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family. Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Por su parte su esposo la ayuda cuando tiene d\u00edas libres en su trabajo, quien se desempe\u00f1a como artesano de mimbre (varitas flexibles de un arbusto). \n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Luz es comprar Maquinaria para coser cueros y una engrapadora el\u00e9ctrica, ya que las costuras al interior de los sof\u00e1s las realiza manualmente, lo que es muy sacrificado para su salud.\n\nSu motivaci\u00f3n para seguir con su negocio es costear los estudios de sus tres hijos.\nPara Luz la ayuda de Fondo Esperanza ha sido fundamental, ya que el financiamiento que se le ha otorgado, ha sido un gran apoyo para su negocio. \nChimbarongo es una comuna ubicada en la regi\u00f3n del Libertador General Bernardo O\u2019Higgins 150 Kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile). Su nombre en mapudungun (lengua mapuche) significa \"lugar entre nieblas\". La econom\u00eda de Chimbarongo est\u00e1 basada principalmente en la elaboraci\u00f3n de artesan\u00edas en mimbre, en el cultivo de frutales y la producci\u00f3n de vino.\n","en":"Luz is part of the community bank \"Renace el Sol con Esfuerzo\" (The Sun Is Reborn with Effort), which belongs to the locality of Chimbarongo in the city of San Fernando.  She works in the repair and re-upholstering of sofas, some of which she buys in poor condition and then repairs to cell them later at a better price.  She also re-upholsters sofas at the request of particular clients.  Luz has been working in this job for 17 years directly from her house, as she has added space in her patio to do her work. She usually goes to pick up old sofas in a small car to move them to her house for repair, but she no longer has access to this vehicle. Luz also makes curtains and cushions.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she will buy fabric, leather, and imitation leather in the cities of Santiago and San Fernando.  In this way, she will increase her production and her earnings.  She lives with her husband and their three children, who also help her with her business.  Her husband helps her when he has time off from his work as a craftsman of mimbre (a flexible type of shrub wood). Luz's dream is to purchase machinery to sew leather and an electric stapler, as she currently does the interior stitching on the sofas manually, which is causing her health problems.  Her motivation to continue with her business comes from her desire to fund the education of her three children.\r\n\r\nThe help of Fondo Esperanza (Hope Fund) has been fundamental for Luz, as the credit has supported her greatly in her business. Chimbarongo is located in the region Libertador General Bernando O'Higgins, 150 kilometers to the south of Santiago, the capital of Chile. Its name comes from the Mapuche language, and it means \"place between the clouds.\" Chimbarongo's economy is based principally on artisan crafts made from mimbre, the cultivation of fruit trees, and the production of wine."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":712517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Upholstery","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase of

Para Patricio su edad no es impedimento para seguir surgiendo y obteniendo buenos provechos; ya que de muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le inculcaron a trabajar en la chacra, es campesino cuenta 06 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivados con plantas de barbasco, cacao, hojas de coca y pl\u00e1tano; que son oriundas de la zona selv\u00e1tica del Valle R\u00edo Apurimac.

He is from the district of San Francisco. He is married to Rosa, who is 50 years old. They have two children together, Edwin, who is 28 years old, and Noely, who is 15 years old. They live in their own house in the community of Las Palmas, which is annexed to the district of Ayna San Francisco. \r\n\r\nFor Patricio, his age is not an impediment to continuing to work and make a good living. From the time he was very young, his parents taught him to work in the fields. He is a farmer and has 6 hectares of land planted with barbasco root, cocoa beans, coca leaves, and plantains, all of which originate in the jungle area of the Aprurimac River Valley. \r\n\r\nHe has been farming for 35 years. During harvest times he has the help of his family and day laborers to bring the harvest in. What he likes most about his work is harvesting. When he sees the quality of his crops, then he sees the return on his hard work. The most difficult aspect for him is transporting his products from the fields to the city of San Francisco, which is where he is offered the best prices for his products and coca leaves.

She is a cheerful hardworking woman who lives in her own home with her husband Alejandro, age 55, and their two beloved daughters, M\u00f3nica (age 25) and Zulema (age 20).  Both of her children are still financially dependent on her.  What she wants most is to provide her family with a better quality of life.  As a young woman, Martha discovered her taste for fashion by selling clothes.  Eventually she decided to open a clothing shop and now has a small booth at a shopping center called \u201cGamarrita\u201d where she offers a variety of domestic and imported clothing.  On the weekends, she travels to various fairs held in different towns in the Apurimac River Valley where she is able to sell her goods at better prices.  Martha has been working in this business for ten years and has the support of her husband who helps with making sales.  What she enjoys most about her work is advising her customers about which clothes are fashionable in the city of Lima and earning their trust.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting the heavy bundles of clothing to different fairs.  However, she refuses to give up since the welfare of her family depends on her business.  Eventually she hopes to open another shop in the city of Pichari, an area that is still developing and has a large population.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  Martha is willing to submit all of her payments on time because she wants to access another loan very soon.

sugiriendo y con su primer financiamiento en la Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo logr\u00f2 comprar una vitrina dandole el esquema de punto de venta, tal como ella lo habia planeado pues compr\u00f2 vitrinas y las surti\u00f2 de articulos de papeler\u00eca , teniendo como su principal mercado a las madres de los ni\u00f1os que ella cuida  en un hogar comunitario, o   asignaci\u00f2n que ofrece el

muchas oportunidades, pues ha conocido proveedores  de alimentos  de los mismos hogares comunitarios, con los que ha realizado contratos, como el que ahora tiene de proveer a 512 hogares de bienestar de alimentos derivados de la harina de trigo. Por eso desde el principio siendo consciente de esta oportunidad compr\u00f3 equipos b\u00e1sicos  de panader\u00eda como la sobadora, el horno, contrat\u00f3 un panadero, y alquil\u00f3 un local con muchos implementos de panader\u00eda con los que resolvi\u00f3 su problema inicial de capacidad productiva de la que hoy goza y por la cual recibe tambi\u00e9n ingresos y la oportunidad del contrato ya mencionado. \nEste es el segundo financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Maro Santo Domingo y est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva para comprar materias primas para su panader\u00eda, refrescos, dulces, implementos de aseo , para responder efectivamente a este contrato, porque su  gran desaf\u00edo es justamente lograr sostener esta relaci\u00f3n, ofreciendo la calidad que amerita los productos que son consumidos por infantes, los cuales debes ser procesados con las normas higi\u00e9nicas y nutricionales de calidad y con la oportunidad que requiere la provisi\u00f3n diaria de estos a cada hogar de bienestar.\n","en":"Marggi Ram\u00edrez lives in Malambo with her spouse and 18-year-old son.  This municipality is part of Barranquilla\u2019s metropolitan area.  Marggi has her own business called: \u201cMiscel\u00e1nea y Panader\u00eda Jorgito,\u201d which opened for business 7 years ago selling catalogue cosmetics.  Gradually she added other merchandise according to what her customers suggested and with her first Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo loan she bought a display case giving the appearance of a sales point just like she\u2019d planned because she bought display cases and stocked them with stationery items since her main market were mothers of the children she cares for in a group home, or placement that the national government offers to women who have been previously trained, to support the nourishment and care of small children in the community so that their parents can work and the children will be well cared for, educated and fed nutritionally.  \r\n\r\nIn Marggi\u2019s case, she\u2019s been a \u201ccommunity mother\u201d for 14 years, an activity that has provided many opportunities because she\u2019s met suppliers of food to the group homes with whom she\u2019s negotiated contracts like the one she now has to supply 512 welfare homes with foods derived from wheat flour.  Because of this, aware from the beginning of this opportunity, she bought basic bakery equipment like a kneader and an oven, she hired a baker and leased a locale with many bakery tools which solved her initial problem of productive capacity which she now enjoys and through which she earns income and the opportunity of the previously mentioned contract.\r\n\r\nThis is the second financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she\u2019s applying for a Kiva loan to buy raw materials for her bakery, soft drinks, candy and cleaning supplies to respond effectively to this contract because her great challenge is precisely to maintain this relationship offering quality that the food the infants consume demands which must be processed following hygienic and nutritional norms of quality and with the opportunity that the daily provision to each wellbeing home entails.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":712636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy raw

Born and raised in El Paso, Texas, Adrian has worked in restaurants since he was 14 years old.  When he decided to start a business, it made sense he start in an industry he already knew.  Adrian and his brother manage Wing Shack, with Adrian running restaurant operations and his brother in charge of finances.\r\n\r\nAdrian and his brother have had a hand in every aspect of Wing Shack from the beginning.  Wing Shack\u2019s menu is their own creation with their own recipes.  They bought an existing building and renovated it to fit the restaurant\u2019s needs.  They personally painted and remodeled the inside, and actually built the restaurant bar themselves.  \r\n\r\nAdrian heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana through the local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, after his bank denied him a loan.  Adrian\u2019s primary objective with this loan is to build credit.  This is the first loan Adrian has received for Wing Shack, having to this point relied on his own capital and loans from friends.  By building credit through this loan, Adrian will be able to qualify for greater financing in the future, if and when the need arises.  \r\n\r\nSince Wing Shack opened in March, 2010, it has consistently had strong sales.  The problem is that expenses sometimes have the money going out as quickly as it comes in.  When bills come in at once, it temporarily puts stress on cash flow.  The additional cushion this loan provides will ensure they have enough money to meet monthly operating costs.\r\n\r\nAdrian says, right now, his life is the business.  Down the road, Adrian would like to open a second Wing Shack in El Paso\u2019s western half, and possibly someday make it a franchise.  Adrian warns other business owners not to cut corners, and to properly insure their business.  Recently, there was an ice storm in El Paso that forced Wing Shack to close for three days.

She took advantage of the fact that she has a lot of family members there and they made up her first domestic market.  Her business very soon started to become successful and this encouraged her because she started contributing to her household expenses and reached the point where she and her husband were able to save and buy their own house in a close community where there are many businesses.\r\n\r\nThis is Ang\u00e9lica's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to use it to buy cosmetics, perfume and clothes in larger quantities.  With this injection of working capital, she will expand her market and be able to respond quickly and in a timely fashion to her new customers' orders.  Her goal is to have well-equipped and comfortable premises, ready to attract the attention and desire to buy of those who approach them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":712683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy cosmetics,

In this city he started working as a construction assistant.  He carried out this job for two years and then worked as a shop assistant for 6 months.  Finally, he went to Bogot\u00e1 to 'try his luck', also working in the construction trade.  In 1996 he returned to Barranquilla where he sold merchandise on a small scale to neighbors and family members, selling to order.  He did this until 1997 when he was assaulted and left with a permanent disability in his legs.  That same year he got married and he currently has two children (twins).\r\n\r\nRamiro, in spite of his disability, is a very independent and proactive man.  He took courses in handicrafts, specialized in book binding and worked as an instructor while he made diaries and other implements to sell to local university students.  He also managed two cafeterias from which he received monthly payment.  With the support of some capital from his wife, he started selling towels and sheets that a female friend of his acquired at good prices for him to sell.  With the profits he and his wife made, they bought a hot dog cart and hired a worker for it but things didn't work out as they had planned and they saw their capital reduced.  Ramiro decided to work in the business himself and in two weeks he doubled his investment since he had a good sales location.  He bought his supplies himself in a delicatessen where he went daily in his wheelchair.  With the profits he made, he bought another hot dog cart and a pizza oven and hired an employee for each location but this time he took a lot of control of the business and he worked preparing the sauces together with his wife who helped him some nights.\r\n\r\nWith his savings in an account, he came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for and access the social housing programs with government subsidy.  He was given a subsidy and obtained a micro housing loan to complete his financial closing.  In 2004 he received his house which he adapted.\r\n\r\nRamiro is an exemplary man.  He puts a lot of willpower into his activities and doesn't let them fail.  For this reason, he has held onto his business every time that he has faced a challenge.  He currently has a helper who he pays on a daily basis.  In his business, he has a hot dog cart, a pizza oven, one fryer and two sets of table and chairs.  He makes on average 200,000 Colombian pesos every weekend with an average increase of 50% on public holidays.  He has received loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to adapt his house, to organize his business and also a mortgage loan.  His goals are marked by the growth of his business for which he would like to acquire a grill.  This will allow him to diversify his services to include meats, grilled chicken and other products.  This is the reason he is applying for a Kiva loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":485.4,"image":{"id":712688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is a 56-year old single woman who supports her family by operating a business venture: buying & selling ready to wear clothing. She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. Delia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she could continue to save up for the future to improve living conditions. Delia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 32-year old single woman who supports her family by operating a grocery store and an electronic loading business.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for the grocery store so that she could expand into produce business. Cristina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating a business of buying, weaving and selling nipa (a palm whose foliage is used for thatching). Her husband, Bennymar, who is 30 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 4 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 6,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $75, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Gilda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our team.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":710892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase more supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cauayan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-02-15T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

is a 36-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: buying and selling of livestock and vegetable vending business. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her livestock and vegetable vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. \r\n\r\nRosa is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she  could fund her business operations. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 36-year old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: selling livestock and an eatery business.  She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her livestock and eatery businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. \r\n\r\nEmelia is borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she could fund her business operations. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Picture was taken after the center meeting because her business was already sold during the market day at Kabankalan City. Emelia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 26-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a business venture; a sari-sari (general) store. She lives in Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. \r\n\r\nJosephine is  borrowing PHP 11,000 as an additional working capital for her general store business. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Josephine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Joel, 43, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 18 and 19 years old, one already with their own family, the other attending school. <p>\r\n\r\nMarivic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion.  Marivic is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She lives in Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her ready-to-wear clothes business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. \r\n\r\nRosita is  borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she could purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a married woman who lives in Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental.

Her husband Leopoldo, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 9 children who are 4 to 24 years old with 4 of their children already working while the other 4 are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nYolanie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Yolanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for future business expansion.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a livestock business. Her husband Roberto, who is 62 years old, works as a Laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 28 to 36 years old. \r\n\r\nClarita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Clarita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional capital so that she could continue to save up for the future and her family's needs. Clarita  is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 56 years old. Marina is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Marina P..\r\n\r\nMarina is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Marina owns and operates a fruit-selling business. Marina has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Marina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Marina is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Marina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":707957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is a very active lady and performs her duties very well. \r\n\r\nNusrat has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner Asasah to expand her husband\u2019s jewelry business. With the loan, her husband will buy jewelry, such as rings, earrings, necklaces and bangles, in larger quantities to increase his business variety and boost sales. Nusrat\u2019s husband started this business six years ago and Nusrat is hopeful that a loan investment will increase profits so she will be able to start saving money for her elder daughter\u2019s marriage. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Nusrat is holding the blue Asasah Passbook. She is a new loan applicant with Asasah and is hopeful that this loan will increase her profits.

He decided to join Yehu because of its efficiency of loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.48,"image":{"id":712950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water

This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase more firewood to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for her child and family needs. Alma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

is a married woman who lives in Rizal, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a general store and a piggery business.  Her husband Nickarter, who is 47 years old, works as a solar collector to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 10 and 25 years old. Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,700, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Erlinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

and a gasoline retail business. A resident of Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, Maria Fe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable, and now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. <p>\r\n\r\nFor her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria Fe is borrowing PHP 15000 in order to purchase more stocks to sell. Her previous loan of PHP 7000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria Fe aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They have two children who are 14 and  23 years old. \r\n\r\nElena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow, making an income from the sales of products from her farm. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers such as manure so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of business. Elena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the help of her past second loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sylvia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

is a married woman who lives in Rizal, Palawan. She earns a living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and a food vending business selling native delicacies. Her husband Rey, who is 44 years old, works as a welder.  He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 3 children who are between 13 and 18 years old.  Two of her children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAnelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000,  uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th cycle loan, Anelita is borrowing PHP 28000 to buy stock of goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Anelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  used clothing, pig fattening and fishing. Her husband Tarciano, who is 51 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have four children who are 18 to 28 years old. Luzminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16 loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to buy additional used clothes to resell to save up for the future education of her children. Luzminda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Aborlan, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a general store and buying & selling dry goods.  Her husband Orville, who is 37 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 8 and 12 years old. Joyce joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joyce has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the sari-sari (general) store to save up for the future expansion of her business. Joyce is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
