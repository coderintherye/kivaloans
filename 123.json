She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. <P>\r\n\r\nBaroat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. Thanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. <P>\r\n\r\nBaroat wants to keep on educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. <P>With this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) with a term of 12 months to buy a calf in order to expand her business and to improve the living conditions of the family. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live. Your generosity can change their lives.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":192220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing

A. is a citizen of the city of Yavan. He is 32 years old, married and has four children. He is unemployed. He earns an income by raising large-horned cattle and selling milk. Two of his cows have given birth so it is important that he increases the size of his cow barn. That is why he wants to receive a loan so that he can buy building materials. By building a strong cow barn he will be able to be well prepared for the winter and not worry that the cold weather would injure the cows. He plans to repay the loan within 12 months.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

Back then, her family\u2019s main source of income came from farming, breeding pigs and fishes, but they didn\u2019t generate a lot of income. Consequentially, Mrs. T. decided to rent a place to start buying and selling wastes. Mrs. T. used the loan of the first round to invest in poultries, but she didn\u2019t make much profit. Learning the mistake, Mrs. T. since then has invested the loans from TYM in her business, from which she earns about 200000 VND per day. The business has aided her family financially a great deal. In the next round of loan, Mrs. T. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND ($550) to expand her business. Her family\u2019s monthly income is about 6.000.000 VND. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

As Mrs. H. and her family live in the countryside, the main source of income for them comes from farming. To enhance the family\u2019s income, Mrs. H. considered raising poultries, but back then she didn\u2019t have the capital to put her plan into practice. This motivated her to become a member of TYM Fund, from whom she would be able to request for loans. In the first round of loan, Mrs. H. asked for 3.000.000 VND, which she used to buy pigs, ducks and raised them. As a result, the family\u2019s financial situation has been improved a lot. Mrs. H. is currently breeding 9 pigs for meat and 200 ducks for eggs. In this round, Mrs. H. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND to invest in poultries. Her family\u2019s monthly income is about 5.000.000 VND. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by KH.

Thi Vy is 36 years old. Before joining the fund, her family's financial situation was difficult because the main source of their income came totally from farming. The first loan with TYM was for 180.00 USD and she invested in her business of selling mats. Since then, the family's income has improved. In the process of shopping, she and her husband notice the production of rubber bands as a new craft, and there is a demand for them in the market. With that thought, they decided to change direction of their business. With the money they have saved combined with a loan from TYM fund, they were able to purchase a rubber band cutting machine. Presently the business is doing very well, with average daily income of 12.00 USD. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550.00 USD. Average monthly income is 360.00 USD  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

When first joining the fund, she borrowed 185.00 USD to buy materials for making baskets. In this business, they are able to use the labor of everyone in the family. Because of their skillfulness and years of experience in this trade, customers always place their orders ahead and thus her family did not have to spend time trying to sell the baskets. Their daily income from making the baskets is 9.00 USD. Her son works outside the home and makes about 92.00 USD per month. For this loan, her family wishes to borrow 550.00 USD to continue investment in their basket- making business.

H. Thi Duyen is 54 years old, retired military personnel with a stable monthly income. However, she is a hardworking woman and likes to stay active. In 2006 she joined TYM fund to borrow money for a breeding farm, and she chose to raise pigs. Because she is retired, she has a lot of time to invest in the family's pig breeding farm.  Her first year in the fund already brought good results right from the first loan. She decided to borrow a higher amount for her second loan,and also invested it in her pig farm. The income she made from her pig farm was used to purchase things for their daily lives, and to educate her children. She currently has 2 children in trade school. For this loan, she would like to borrow 550.00 USD to invest in her pig farm.

Thi Bay, 35 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2006. Born in the rural area, she understands that she would face financial problems if her family only relied on farming. Right after she was married, she discussed with her husband to find a business that would stablise their family's economy, and they decided on selling pork. Everyday, her husband goes to the town market to buy pork which her sells at home whiL. Mrs. Bay then sells in the village market, bringing back a daily profit of 150,000VND (about 10USD). Since joining the Fund, her family has had more capital so their business has been even more smooth. Besides, she still has a source of income from farming and raising livestock. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550.00USD) to further invest in her business. Her family's average monthly income is 6,000,000VND (about 400USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3y 35 tu\u1ed5i.

She was able to make a profit 2500 000d after this initial loan.  Mat making is not hard work; it\u2019s able to bring a steady income for the family.  The loans she requested and received thereafter were used for her business and some of the money was invested in livestock as well.  The operation of her mat making business has gone smoothly now that the business is stable.   The family is able to produce 5 mats in a day and after all expenses, they are able to profit 150.000d from each mat.

is divorced and lives with her 19-year-old daughter, who is a student.  She is originally from the province of Ayaviri but has lived in Puno for the last four years, where her daughter studies at the local university.  Three years ago, Ms. Felicitas rented a place to start a restaurant in order to make money to support herself and her daughter after she and her husband separated.  She is very happy in her work, serving her customers her delicious stews.  However, the hardest part of the job is earning enough money to buy the ingredients she needs since prices have gone up recently.

This is quite challenging, but she likes her job because it allows her to earn the money she needs to care for her sons and be able to spend time with them also. <p>\r\n\r\nDebora plans to use the loan money to buy additional lingerie and increase her inventory.  The extra income will allow her to give her children a better education.  In the future, Debora plans to have her own stand where she can sell her products.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Chegezy, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDebora es una mujer de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, separada de su pareja y madre de dos hijos; Edison de 8 y Andr\u00e9s de 4, con los que vive actualmente en una vivienda alquilada.\r\nElla es de la ciudad capital, Lima reside en la ciudad de Juliaca hace cinco a\u00f1os, culmin\u00f3 sus estudios secundarios y desde entonces se ha dedicado a trabajar en diferentes labores, en el negocio de la venta de lencer\u00eda tiene ocho a\u00f1os de experiencia, ofreciendo sus productos de forma ambulatoria por las diferentes calles de la ciudad de Juliaca.

After losing her husband at a young age, she struggled to raise her children who now all have finished school and have grown.  She has been a member since 2006.  Her initial loan of 2.000.000d was used to purchase hogs in hope to support her family financially.  After seeing the success of her business, she became more confident and seeks more loans to help with her business.  The profits gained and loan she received thereafter was used to expand her business and she was even able to buy hens-to lay eggs.  At this present time, her livestock consists of 7 pigs and 200 hens.  Her daily income is about 200.000d.  Three of her five children are grown and are living on their own.  The other 2 children reside with her and both have steady jobs with a 3.000.000d\/month income.  This time she is requesting a loan of 6.000.000 to invest in farm animals.

Before joining TYM fund, her family was going through difficult time: big family, her children did not have stable jobs so they could not help her much. In 2007, she joined TYM fund. Her first loan was for 2.000.000 VND. She bought 2 calves, kept them for a year then sold them for 3.000.000 VND. Then with the money from the sale, she invested in raising pigs & ducks. Currently she has 2 breeding cows, 8 pigs and a paddle of 200 egg laying ducks. Now her family annual income is 50.000.000 VND. Her children are all grown up and hold a stable job, their income is 4.000.000 VND a month. This time she is requesting a loan of 7.000.000 to invest more in her pig & duck business.

Thi Huong, 42 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2003. She borrowed the first loan of 2,000,000VND (125USD) to invest in her small general store in the market. Her daily income from this is about 100,000VND (6.25USD). Since joining the Fund, the income from this business has been higher. Besides the store, she also invests in rearing pigs. This is also the main source of income for her family, as every year she can sell 3 rounds of pigs, each round 3 tonnes, yielding a profit of about 35,000,000VND (2187.50USD). This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to continue investing in rearing pigs. Her average monthly income is 5,000,000VND (312.50USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Thi H\u01b0\u01a1ng 42 tu\u1ed5i, Tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2003.

Thi Ly, 40 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007 with the goal of improving her family's financial situation. Her first loan of 5,000,000VND (312.50USD) was used to invest in rearing pigs. Realizing the high profit gained, her family decided to renovate the pig sty to continue rearing pigs in a large scale. Since then, her family members have been putting more effort into work. Her husband also works as a construction worker with the monthly income of 2,000,000VND (125USD). Mrs. Ly sometimes works as cleaner for the village's administration house for the monthly income of 1,000,000VND (62.50USD). With these stable incomes, her family has always been able to repay the loan fully. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to invest in rearing pigs. Her family's average monthly income is 4,000,000VND (250USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb L\u00fd 40 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2007 v\u1edbi m\u1ee5c \u0111\u00edch vay v\u1ed1n ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf.

S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania! This is 35-year-old Debora Leonard. She is married and has three children ages two, seven, and thirteen. In 2005, Debora established her small grocery shack (or genge) business. Working six days a week, and  nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about 30 USD every month from this business. Debora requires a loan in order to purchase more sugar, salt, cooking oil and home appliances in bulk. In the future, Debora plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n<P>\r\nThe Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is \"genge.\" A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chiles, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and discover they are short an ingredient or two.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her.

The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more sugar, rice, soap, cooking oil in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T19:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:24:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356207,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347949,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970523,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886740,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436000,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:24:07Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61338,"name":"Apaikunda's Hekima Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Apaikunda  is 41 years old.

This is 23-year-old Ikupa M.. She is married and has one child, aged nine months. In 2007, Ikupa established her clothes business. She opens her business six days a week and  nine to twelve hours a day. Ikupa requires a loan in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, Ikupa plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<P>\r\nSecond-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress; however, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her.

Thi Truc, 45 years old, has 5 children, 2 of whom are already married. Like many other rural families, her family relies mainly on agriculture. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 2.000.000VND (about 125USD) to invest in breeding ducks. Since then, her family's financial situation has improved and the quality of life has been better. Besides breeding ducks, she also used the subsequent loans to rear pigs. Currently, she has 7 pigs, 200 breeding ducks, each year yielding a high profit. Her children are all working and having stable monthly income of 3.000.000VND (about 187.50USD). This time round, she would like to borrow 8.000.000VND (500USD) to purchase fruit tree saplings and fertilizers.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

Before joining TYM, the financial situation of the family was not good. Her husband is farmer as well as a construction worker, earning 2.000.000 VND per month. They have two children, both of whom are still in school. For the past 10 years, Mrs. H. has been using all the loans to invest in breeding poultries. In the first round, Mrs. H. took out only 500.000 VND to raise pigs. After that, Mrs. H. has borrowed more loans to expand her business and renovate her house. As a very industrious woman, Mrs. H. is also a porter besides raising poultries at home, from which she earns about 2.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 12.000.000 VND ($725) to renovate the breeding facilities and buy buffaloes.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To expand and renovate her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:50:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bupe I.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:21:33Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356210,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347952,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970526,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886743,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436003,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:21:33Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61345,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb V\u0103n 32 tu\u1ed5i, ngh\u1ec1 nghi\u1ec7p ch\u00ednh c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng, ngo\u00e0i ra gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f2n l\u00e0m ngh\u1ec1 ph\u1ee5 \u0111\u00f3ng g\u1ea1ch t\u00e1p l\u00f4 b\u00e1n.

This is 26-year-old Bahati K.. She is married and has two children aged 6 and 8. She has two dependents, who live with her because they are orphans. In 2007, Bahati established her kuku (chicken) ranching business. She is open for business six days a week and five to eight hours a day. She is assisted by her husband. Bahati requires a loan in order to purchase more kuku (50). In the future, Bahati plans to expand and establish another business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n<p>\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. (In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku.) For the rest of you... who or what are \"kuku,\" you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons: they require little start-up capital, require little space, and while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. There are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more kuku (chickens)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:50:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahati L.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:07:55Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356211,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347953,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970527,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886744,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436004,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:07:55Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61347,"name":"Mage M.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Mbeya, Tanzania!

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tutindaga N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:44:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356214,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347956,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970530,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886747,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436007,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:44:48Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61351,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb N. 45 tu\u1ed5i.

Mrs. H.\u2019s husband is not only a farmer but also a construction worker, earning about 2.000.000 VND per month. The family\u2019s financial situation is relatively good compared to that of other families in her neighborhood. When TYM Fund opened its branch in her area, Mrs. H. didn\u2019t hesitate to participate in the program and request loans. Because the loan of the first round was limited, Mrs. H. could only take out 500000 VND and used it to breed chickens. As the amount of loans that can be borrowed increases annually, Mrs. H. has used them to raise pigs and cows. The family\u2019s situation has been improved a lot as a result, which allows the family to purchase necessary furniture for their house. Her two children who are working make 3.000.000 VND per month, which helps the whole family a lot. In the next round of loan, Mrs. H. would like to borrow 11.000.000 VND ($ 675) to keep investing in poultries.

She and her husband had encountered too many contradictions trying to build their lives together, so they parted ways. She decided not to remarry and stayed single taking care of her child. She joined the fund in 1997 and borrowed money to invest in raising pigs. After raising pigs she was able to make enough money and bought a water buffalo to use in her farming business. Now she wants to invest in raising sows. Her child is now grown and working, making average 93 USD per month. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 625 USD to invest in her sow raising business.

Thi Huong is 32 years old. When she was younger, her parents let her go to sewing school so that she would not have a hard life. After getting married, she continued with her sewing business, but due to lack of money the income from her sewing business was not regular. In 2000 she joined the fund after discussing with her husband in order to borrow money to purchase fabrics. With the loan, she was able to  buy a lot of fabrics, and combined with her experience, her business expanded bringing in more customers. In addition to rice farming, her husband also does carpentry\/construction work, and makes average of 120 USD per month, which makes their family income more stable. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 425 USD to purchase fabrics.

Her husband is currently working in the States under one labor export program. Mrs. L. only borrowed 2.000.000 VND in the first round of loan to invest in tailoring. As Mrs. L. is a skilled tailor, her shop is very popular in her area. Realizing that she still had time to do something else besides tailoring, Mrs. L. started using the loans from TYM Fund to open a small shop selling a variety of necessities at home in 2003. This has helped her family make about 3.000.000 VND per month. Her husband sends money back home every month to help the whole family. In the next round of loan, Mrs. L. would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to purchase more goods for her shop.

Her family\u2019s occupations are farming and raising poultries (chickens, ducks and fishes). She has three children, two of whom are working while the other is still in school. In the first round of loan, Mrs. T. took out 2.000.000 VND to raise fishes and plant rice. Mrs. T. then used the loans of the next rounds to raise ducks and expand her ranch. This has generated a lot of profits for the family. Mrs. T. currently has 8 ponds to raise fishes, 300 ducks for eggs and 400 ducks for meat. The profits from raising ducks for eggs are about 300000 VND per day. Her two children who are working have an income of 3.000.000 VND per month. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 10.000.000 VND ($625) to purchase food for poultries.

She opens her business six days a week and nine to twelve hours a day. Edina requires a loan in order to buy more red palm for extracting oil. She thanks you for your support. \r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for S. client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more redpalm for extracting oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edina L.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:56:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356215,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347968,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970542,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886759,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436019,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:56:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61377,"name":"Mavjuda","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Mavjuda M. lives in the Vakhsh region of Tajikistan.

This is 30-year-old Ema M.. She is married and has four children aged between two and twelve. In 2000, Ema established her boutique business. Working seven days a week, and nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about 20 USD every month from this business. Ema requires a loan in order to buy more clothes in bulk. She thanks you for your support. \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more clothes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ema E.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T18:57:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356216,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347969,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970543,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886760,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T18:57:18Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61379,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u00e2m 35 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ngh\u1ec1 x\u00e2y d\u1ef1ng c\u00f4ng vi\u1ec7c c\u1ee7a anh r\u1ea5t \u1ed5n \u0111\u1ecbnh cho thu nh\u1eadp h\u00e0ng th\u00e1ng l\u00e0 2.000.000\u0111, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 v\u01b0\u1eddn r\u1ed9ng n\u00ean ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u1ed3ng c\u00e1c lo\u1ea1i rau ngo\u00e0i ra ch\u1ecb c\u00f2n l\u00e0m th\u00eam ngh\u1ec1 h\u00e0ng x\u00e1o.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristina P.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:56:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356217,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347970,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970544,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886761,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:56:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61382,"name":"Dilbar","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Dilbar M. lives in the Djalollidini Rumi region of Tajikistan.

She works six days a week and operates a salon and beauty shop. She buys her merchandise twice a week from the Kampala city centre and uses public transport back to her shop. Mariam rents the shop where she operates her business and sells on both a retail and wholesale basis. Her customers are women in her community and those on the move. She works on 3-4 customers daily. Her challenges include: high rental charges, transport costs, thieves who usually break into her shop, and flooding during the rainy season. The area where she is operating is prone to floods, and this destroys her merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nShe was inspired to join MCDT because it was dealing with the active poor. She caters to customers who were previously moving long distances looking for salons and cosmetics. She has been with MCDT for the last 3 years and is servicing her seventh loan. She has been able to improve her standards of living by getting three meals daily and also taking her children to good schools. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent commercial house where she will be operating and also seeing her business progressing.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam is a leader of a 5-member group. She is 38 years old and married with 5 children. They are aged between 18 and 10 years, and they are all in school. Mariam owns a five-room house in which she lives with 7 people. She also takes care of two orphans of her late brother. There is no piped water, but she has electricity.

She buys her merchandise from Kampala city centre. She buys all types of goods from both retail and wholesale and uses public transport to transport her merchandise from Kampala to her salon\/shop in Bwaise. She makes the trip twice a week. Her customers are women in her community and those on the move.\r\n<p>\r\nHer challenges include paying high taxes, high rental charges, and transport costs. Flooding is a problem during the rainy season as the area where she is operating is prone to floods, which destroys her merchandise. It was once a wetland. Another challenge is that of her business being seasonal. During periods when there is low demand for salons, she switches to selling cereals and legumes, mainly dried beans. She has been operating this business for the last 10 years and was inspired by the way women were moving long distances looking for salons. She has been able to improve her standards of living, provide her family with three meals daily. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent home to operate from and also seeing her business progressing.\r\n<p>\r\nBeatrice is the leader of a 4-member group.

from Tanzania! Rehema S. is a twenty-eight-year-old married woman from Dar es Salaam. Rehema owns and operates a small stall, which she established six months ago, from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch. Rehema roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market or along the roads of Dar. Given its location along the Indian Ocean, fish is plentiful in the waters around Dar es Salaam and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet. Rehema is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of 120 USD. She is currently requesting a loan of 225 USD in order to purchase fish in larger quantities. In the future, Rehema plans to open another stall to sell her delectable treats.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":192685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy additional supplies of fish in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T18:34:32Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25555.56,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26634,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356218,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":24444.44,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347971,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970545,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886762,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436022,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130296,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027127,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613167,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010250,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T18:34:32Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61424,"name":"Boubou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Boubou F. is a vulcanizer by trade who was born in 1974 in Ndary.

from Tanzania! Nessy N. is thirty-two years old. She is married with a two-year-old child. She also takes care of two other dependents who live with her because they attend school in the area. Earlier this year, Nessy opened a small shop from which she sells African traditional cloth. Local Tanzanian women purchase cloth from Nessy\u2019s shop and use it to make vitenge, the traditional dress worn by Tanzanian women. Nessy runs the store with one employee and earns about 100 USD in profit each month. Nessy is requesting a loan of 275 USD in order to purchase additional stock of African traditional cloth in bulk. Nessy expects to earn about 200 USD from increased sales after getting this loan. In the future she hopes to increase the quantity and range of the business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":192690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional stocks of traditional African cloth in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:20:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nessy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:17:20Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356219,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347972,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970546,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886763,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:17:20Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61427,"name":"Moussa","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Moussa N. is a young disabled man who was born in 1982 in Thi\u00e8s.

Selina Y. is thirty years old and is married with two children aged four and 11. She also supports an additional dependent who lives with her because this young girl\u2019s parents cannot take care of her. Selina owns a shop where she sells rice, sugar, beans, wheat flour and maize flour. She is assisted by her husband and an employee in running her business. Selina earns about 600 USD from this business monthly. Selina is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, sugar, beans and wheat flour. In the future, Selina plans to open another business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":192696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase supplies in bulk for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:10:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:41:15Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61374,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356220,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":52,"local_amount":59428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":60216,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347973,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970547,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886764,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436024,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130297,"comment":null},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027128,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613168,"comment":null},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010251,"comment":null},{"amount":52.51,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":60795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232562,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:41:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61431,"name":"Irina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irina is divorced with two daughters and a son.

Latifa R. was born thirty-five years ago; she's married with two children, ages 10 and 16. In 2005, Latifa established her poultry business (kuku) which enables her to earn a monthly profit of 500 USD. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Who or what are \"kuku,\" you may ask. Kuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. They require little start-up capital: you can start with two and wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Latifa is requesting the loan of 875 USD in order to purchase 400 chicks and additional feed. In the future, Latifa plans to buy even more chicks and expand her business further!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":192703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy additional chicks and feed for her poultry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T17:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Latifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:21:27Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101904,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356221,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":99428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100746,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347974,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970548,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886765,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436025,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130298,"comment":null},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027129,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613169,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010252,"comment":null},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:21:27Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":61435,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services.

Patzig, Palenqeuch and Rakantela. \r\n<P>Although these groups of women are used to live in their villages and like their lifestyles a lot, they have to leave their towns in order to earn some money. These towns are very poor and commercial activity is very scarce. There are very few shops out there, maybe one or two convenience store per town. Running water is a novelty and men often leave the towns to work in far away cities, even the United States. Most of the \"Mujeres Nahuala\" travel 3 days a week for 4 hours as far as the coast and Toton\u00edcapan to sell their products in the main markets over there.\r\n<P>The number three is a perpetual factor with this group. This is because the women have to travel 3 days a week, they come from 3 different town, and the ladies work in 3 different economic activities. One group of 3 women are buying and selling skirts and huipilles (traditional blouses), 3 of them are buying and selling other typical clothes, and the last 3 including the president, make and embroider skirts and pa\u00f1uelos. The pa\u00f1uelos are the pieces fabric women use to carry their babies, their goods from the markets, and during a chilly day they will wrap the panuelos around them to stay a bit warmer.\r\n<P>The president of the group who herself sows and embroiders skirts and huipilles was the one who formed the group. She was inspired by the success of other people who asked for loans before, so she wanted request one too so she can in her own business and improved her life this way.

Most of the villagers know each other very well which creates an environment of trust. Walking down the clean streets of San Andres one can see many people chatting and children playing. This is a typical village where people help each other out with their daily tasks. \r\nFortunately, this cultural factor is also reflected in Las Rosas\u00b4 organization. Some members of the group are better doing the paperwork and arrange the meetings, whereas others have more acquaintances that can help the younger ones of the group to sell their products to a bigger group of customers.\r\nThis is how Do\u00f1a Manuela C., who is one of oldest of the group, helps the younger members. She has a store in one of the main streets at which she sells traditional blouses. Do\u00f1a Manuela is very well known in the village because of her store. When a customer asks her about clothes she doesn't sell in her store, she refers them to group members like Ami. Ami is one of the younger members of the group. She also sells blouses, but from a different type, they are called croshet blouses, they have a very different look from the traditional ones.\r\nAlma G. is the president of the group. She has a sister in another group who enthusiastically told her about Friendship Bridge. Alma, formed a group with her friends and neighbours who, like her, mostly work in buying and selling clothes. \r\nThey all want to invest their credit in purchasing a more diverse repertoire of clothes. The other four women, who own a food store, also want to expand the diversity of products in order to capture more clients and increase their sales. \r\nLas Rosas want to keep working hard in order to keep building their new improved life. They wish to have a solid business so they don't have to leave their families behind in order to go and sell their goods at far away markets. That's why they try to communicate well to one another about their business ideas so they are not over-supply San Andres with the same goods, says Catalina. \r\n Las Rosas are doing a great job a working together and accomplishing unity within their trust bank, with your support they will keep working in this manner and accomplishing their dreams.

With 200 ducks, the average income of her family is 200.000\u0111. In 2007, the family was able to buy 1 ploughing machine for its own use and to provide ploughing services to other people in the region. The average income every season is 15.000.000\u0111. Her husband still has a job of construction worker. In idle times, he can expect to earn a daily average of 70.000\u0111. With such a regular income, the family was already able to build a spacious house. For this round, the family would like to borrow 9.000.000 to invest further into duck farming.

She and three others also sew skirts.\r\n\r\nThey sell most of their goods in Solol\u00e1 which is the nearest city, about one hour away. The market days there are the best day to have good business, says Paulina. Brigida travels to a town called Godines. This is a town with an crossroads where you can go to several places and because of that, many people pass by. That's why she decided to travel the 2 hours a couple of times a week to sell her goods.\r\n\r\nGenara tells me she went to school for four years only, and she started helping her parents from then on. It is her wish to see her children who are at university now get a degree so they have more choices in what their occupation could be.
