Lahan yang dikerjakan cukup luas,sehingga ia memerlukan buruh untuk mengerjakan sawahnya ini. Namun hasil padi yang dipanen selama ini tidak bagus. Hal ini disebabkan karena keterbatasan dana yang dimiliki oleh Ketut Surja, sehingga dia tidak bisa membeli bibit dengan kwalitas unggul ,maupun cara pemberian pupuk dan pengobatan yang bagus. Ketut Surja hanya menggandalkan bibit lokal saja ,dan pemupukannya pun hanya sekedar, pemberantasan hama tidak dilakukan secara tuntas mengingat harga obat-obatan meningkat drastis.

Setiap hari Suartini memberi makan babi peliharaannya sebanyak 3 kali. Tak lupa juga kandang disiram agar bersih dan segar, sehingga babi peliharaannya bisa sehat dan gemuk. Makanan yang diberikan berupa pakan dedak gandum yang dibeli di toko, kadang juga dedaunan untuk makanan tambahan. Induk babi hanya diikat dipohon karena belum memiliki modal untuk membuat kandang. 2 ekor bibit babi dikurung dikandang bambu. Dalam enam bulan Suartini bisa maraup keuntungan Rp.2.000.000,- bersih dari hasil induk dan bibit babi. Usaha ini sangat menunjang biaya hidup Surtini, bahkan untuk kedepannya Suartini ingin membeli bibit lebih dari 2 ekor. Agar usahanya bisa maju dan berkembang.

K. has been our successful client since 2004. He is married and has one son. His wife stays at home and helps Sabur's mother with house chores. Sabur has been a businessman for 10 years. Sabur used to sell video cassettes on the streets. Having received his first loan from MicroInvest, he increased the volume of sales and successfully paid back his loan. Next, Sabur saved his money and opened his own store; today he has a wide variety of DVDs and many permanent clients not only among local consumers, but also consumers from outlying regions. Savur came to Kiva in hopes of receiving a new loan for the purchase of an additional DVD player and a quantity of DVDs.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

She has been involved in this field for over 6 years, and she now has a steady clientele who make special orders every week. <p>\r\nShe tells us that thanks to this job, she can help her husband cover the household expenses, as well as her children\u2019s educational expenses. <p>\r\nWith this loan, she wishes to purchase silver jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, etc. as well as cosmetics and perfume. Her sales increased during the month of December, so she has been left practically without stock. She already has many orders for the month of February because people would like to offer her products as St. Valentine\u2019s Day gifts.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCarmen, es una se\u00f1ora emprendedora, casada y madre de 2 ni\u00f1os.

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing.\r\nSophia's bar is a good place to get a beer for those who manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. It\u2019s the kind of place where one can relax on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand.

from Mbeya, Tanzania! Tully M. is 28 years old. She is not married but has three children, who are ages 4,7 and 10. In 2003, Tully established a local restaurant business. Tully has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA. She now requests a new loan in order to buy more kitchen utensil and food to sell. \r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":126494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more kitchen utensils and food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-11T16:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tully","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-25T20:03:34Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165953,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191737,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219400,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248534,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":59,"local_amount":67428.57,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":69118.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277090,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":55,"local_amount":62857.14,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":64432.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306654,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-02-11T20:03:34Z","paid_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":35380,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan is a 32 year old father of two, who works and lives with his family in south Lebanon, in Nabatieh.

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Atukuzwe S. is 26 years old. She is widowed with two children, ages 8 and 11. In 2004, Atukuzwe established a clothing business. Atukuzwe now requests a loan in order to purchase a motorcycle to transport her goods. \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SELFINA <P>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing.

When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":126523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase salon equipment and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-10T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-24T22:18:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-03-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165955,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191739,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-05-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219402,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":248536,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":35145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277092,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":29287.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":306656,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-02-10T22:18:59Z","paid_date":"2008-08-25T09:15:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":35403,"name":"Galina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Galina has a small stand where she sells books, newspapers and magazines at an outdoor market in Noviy Rosdil, Ukraine.

While she worked there, she aquired a lot of experience and knowledge on textiles thanks to the constant training they provided.  When the factory had a staff reduction, she was let go.  However, she didn't allow herself to feel upset about the situation, instead she felt sufficiently trained and empowered to begin her own sewing business.  Esperanza, with her only extra possession - a sewing machine, began to sew clothing for some of her family members and friends.  Today, she sews clothing due to the many requests from her clients, which she is thankful she does not lack. Her goal within a few years is to run her own garment workshop, where she will work along with her youngest daughter and her nieces.  To this end, she needs a variety of sewing machines.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA ra\u00edz de que su primer negocio, una peque\u00f1a bodega, no era rentable para ella y su peque\u00f1o hijo de 3 a\u00f1os, Esperanza decidi\u00f3 trabajar en una empresa textil con sus pocos conocimientos sobre costura.\r\nDurante el tiempo que ella laburo en este empresa adquiri\u00f3 mucha experiencia y  conocimientos sobre el tema textil gracias a la constante capacitaci\u00f3n que obtuvo.

They live in the municipality of Obraje, which is in the city of Chinandega in Nicaragua. <p>\r\n\r\nA problem that Donald encounters is the lack of electric energy in his area since it is very far from the city. For this reason, he uses candles in the evenings but they only light up a small part of his home.  To fix this situation, Donald has borrowed loans from Ceprodel to buy a solar panel.  In this way, he can light up his home and have access to television for his family. <p>\r\n\r\nHis greatest need is to pay off the debt used to buy a solar panel so he can continue to sustain his home and improve the standard of living for him and his family.  \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nEl caballero Donald B. desde muy ni\u00f1o se dedica al negocio de la ganaderia agricultura siendo este su negocio con el que mantiene a su humilde familia que habita en el municipio el Obraje de la ciudad de Chinandega en Nicaragua.\r\n<p>\r\nUna problem\u00e1tica que atraviesa Donald es que en su localidad no existe energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica por estar muy lejos de la ciudad y por tal raz\u00f3n debe de alumbrarse por las noches con candelas que solamente iluminan una peque\u00f1a parte del hogar.

This is the reason Mrs. Concepcion is requesting the installation of a solar panel in her home to improve her living conditions.  To cover the costs she is requesting a loan from Ceprodel which will enable her to pay for the panel that she so needs.
