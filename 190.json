She lives there with her husband, her son and her niece.  For the past five years she has worked raising small animals.  She started this business when she lost most of her money from her business selling chicken meat.  Although circumstances prevented her from continuing to do that job, she found a way to earn a living without having to leave her home.  Raising animals is a good opportunity and thanks to the large demand in sales of these animals she was able to add a small henhouse in her yard.  She raises and feeds the animals and later sells them to vendors and merchants who give her orders every month.  In the future Elizabeth would like to have a store, in order to have more than one source of income and increase her earnings.

Keuntungan dari penjualan babi peliharaannya setelah dipotong pokok pinjaman ke DINARI mencapai Rp.200.000,- per bulannya.

Melihat ketekunan Ketut Suriani dalam memelihara babi maka DINARI pun kembali membantu dengan pinjaman periode II yang tentunya memang menjadi harapan Ketut Suriani. Pinjaman ke II ini mengalami peningkatan dari sebelumnya menjadi Rp.6000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan. Pelunasan akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman dengan anggapan semua babi peliharaan sudah terjual. Ketut berencana akan membeli 8 ekor babi pada periode ini, dengan harga per ekor Rp.350.000,-. Beberapa diantaranya akan dipelihara hanya 3 bulan, sisanya baru akan dijadikan penggemukan selama 6 bulan. Uang pinjaman ini juga akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan babi selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan. Tentunya Ketut berharap hasil yang didapatkan akan semakin bertambah sehingga mampu membuat ekonomi keluarga menjadi lebih baik lagi.","en":"The period of loan I with Dinari had completed by Ketut Suriani yielding good results.

Definitely this yield improved the economic condition of the family over prior condition as this yield increased to the husband\u2019s income for covering daily expenses.  Observing Ketut Suriani\u2019s diligence in rearing pigs, Dinari is willing to again aid with loan for period II that certainly is hoped by Ketut Suriani.  This loan II will naturally increase over the prior one to Rp.6.000.000,- with a maturity period of 6 months.  Repayment will be at the end of the period with the assumption that all the pigs would have been sold.  Ketut plan to purchase 8 pigs for this period, costing Rp.350.000,-.  Several among then will be reared for 3 months, the balance will reared up to 6 months.  The money from this loan will also be used to buy supplies for the 6 months during the rearing period.

They plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Nhor M. has been selected by the members as the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land for cultivating rice. In this plantation, she faces an obstacle because the field is infertile; thus, she decided to request a loan to buy fertilizer to make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. Um Sam Arth, is a cook who is hired by people for wedding ceremonies, festival ceremonies, parties, and so on. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nhor M. is 51 years old and the mother of three children: one is a security guard, another stays at home to do housework, and the remaining one attends the local school. The husband of group member Mrs. Borin S. is present in the picture too. \r\n<p>\r\nEleven members of this group loan are utilizing end-of-term loans while the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

ges":["en"],"texts":{"en":"D. Okhunbobo is the happily married father of two children. He leases eight hectares of land, all of which are planted with vegetables, as there is generally adequate irrigation all year round in the area. Thus, over the course of a year, the land can be planted on a rotational basis with potato, tomato, cucumber, wheat, and barley. Besides these, he has many fruit trees on his land. This rotational planting process preserves the richness of the land. Of course, it is also dependent on the weather. \r\n<p>\r\nFor cultivating land this size, Okhunbobo requires additional funds to increase his expected yield. Last season, Okhunbobo faced considerable difficulties in terms of supplying his land with sufficient water. He has applied to IMON International for a loan in order to ensure a good yield of fruits and vegetables. This is Okhunbobo\u2019s first loan and he is sure that his successful efforts will increase his income and improve his family\u2019s welfare. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She speaks at length about how to meet the needs of her various customers, explaining, for example, that if there is a celebration for someone who is Catholic, the colors will be different than if there is a celebration for someone who is Protestant. For each event that she decorates, she makes 40,000 to 50,000 Uganda shillings in profit. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence has been running her decorating business since 1988. When she was in school, she realized that she really enjoyed working with flowers and other decorations. After graduating from high school, she worked in various jobs before meeting some women who were doing decorating. She joined with them to learn the trade and has now been working in her florist shop in the city of Kampala for over 20 years. Florence has four employees who help her decorate at the various functions for which she is hired. They help her arrange all the materials. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works with many media. She says that depending on the function, she might use dry, artificial, or real flowers. Besides flowers, she has many beautiful stands and papers that she uses to make everything look beautiful. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence says that loans are what makes her business possible, because she finds that while each customer wants individual decorations, they do not pay ahead of time; therefore, loans allow her to do her work at the high level of quality she expects of herself. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence has five children of her own that are still in school and five grandchildren that she supports. Although her husband is also working, paying school fees for 10 children is a difficult task. Florence is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ush to purchase artificial flowers and some large flower vases for upcoming events. Florence also keeps some pigs in her compound would like to use part of her loan to renovate the area where they are kept.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Khosiyat is 54 years old and an admirable mother. She has shown a great, diligent spirit and enthusiasm for agricultural work and raising cattle. These activities have let her educate her children. She continues to strive toward providing well-being and education for her children and also toward being able to cover the expenses that her delicate health demands daily. As a result of this, her work has been very limited, and her profits have decreased notably. \r\n\r\nKhosiyat now wishes to increase the quality of her products with the purchase of fertilizers with the goal of obtaining a larger income to keep providing her children with education and improve their living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni, which she will use to make her dreams a reality.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is fifty-one years old. She is a widow and the mother of three little kids who are in basic school. Augustina lives with her children in a family house in a community called Nkwaateng. Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite a large number of women are involved in palm oil production. Augustina is one of the women who actively produce palm oil. She has been in business for six years. \r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes it in her house to produce the oil and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from the food of the palm fruits. It has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and boiled again to expel water content. Augustina wants to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruits in bulk. She will then be able to increase the number of customers she serves.

This is 47-year-old Salma K. from Mwanza. She is married. Salma has been running a poultry (\"kuku\") business since 1992. Raising kuku is a popular microbusiness in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. \"Kuku\" means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital: You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Salma works at the business for 9 hours a day, 7 days a week. She currently earns about $200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more chicks to raise and resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Salma thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Their average age is around 50, and they have on average 4 children.  The group members live in large traditional extended families in the Lafiabougou district of the city of San (S\u00e9gou region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another through ties of community and kinship. \r\n <p>\r\nThe group members work in the same business of selling firewood and kitchen utensils (ladles, sieves, etc.) and are in high demand in this domain.  To satisfy the needs of their continuously growing customer base, they had an answer to their problems:  join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their sixth solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding one have been correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members intend to use this loan to buy truck-loads of firewood in surrounding villages and a sizable quantity of kitchen utensils (kettles, sieves, etc.) from artisans at the San marketplace.  The firewood is sold retail in cash transactions at the house.  As for the utensils, these are sold at the San marketplace and at the house to customers essentially composed of women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 80,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.  Their ambition is to diversify their commerce and to open a shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":287244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy firewood and kitchen utensils ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101716.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033721,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50858.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621088,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50858.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020054,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50858.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242798,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50858.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-09T07:09:30Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94850,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dora G. is a 32-year-old married woman with two children in elementary school.

This is Kurusumu M., a 50-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has four children, who are between the ages of 16 and 28 years old. She has been running a charcoal business since 2003. <P>\r\n\r\nCharcoal is used by many Tanzanians as fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots by arranging mkaa (charcoal), and then adding paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. <P>\r\n\r\nBecause there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative. Kurusumu works at the business for 9 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $200 USD per month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more charcoal for resale. In the future, she plans to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more charcoal for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-14T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kurusumu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027611,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613612,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010691,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232977,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664768,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105480,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022625,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867874,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757075,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146187,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-15T02:50:18Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94852,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth S. is 42 years old.

The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel the water content.

Her tenure and effort helped her mature in her business and get ahead educating her daughters. The inputs for working in a beauty salon are costly, and she requires various products. She will invest 1000 soles in order to keep working to beautify her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":287313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase products and goods for beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":63.61},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72.98},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":77.47},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":80.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":99.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.08},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.67,"local_amount":63.61,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":66.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117238,"comment":null},{"amount":21.63,"local_amount":66.57,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":69.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012156,"comment":null},{"amount":23.08,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":73.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595741,"comment":null},{"amount":23.72,"local_amount":72.98,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":75.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990004,"comment":null},{"amount":25.19,"local_amount":77.47,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211137,"comment":null},{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":648.37,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":673.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640644,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T18:36:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":94896,"name":"Hermelinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Hermelinda C.

Her son and husband are a reflection of the great care and support she gives them. Together, they are performing construction on the small house they bought several years ago. Her desire to improve led her to see every day as a day of opportunity, motivating her to go out every morning to the supermarkets where she does her shopping. She sells clothing and cosmetics, which she distributes to her neighbors and friends who take the clothes on credit and pay her weekly. This business began when her son started working at a chain of clothing stores and motivated his mother to bring those fashions closer to the people of her district who don't have the time or money to visit those stores. To avoid high prices, Moraima waits for sales so she can purchase more and sell at very accessible prices. This eagerness to advance comes from her desire to own a boutique. She has been working with MFP for four years; this is her seventh loan. It has been a great help to her business, and she can always count on the women in her group during any circumstance.

With perseverance she has been able to provide shelter and care for her children and husband.  She lives with them, and they are part of her work team.  From a young age she wished to have a happy home. This motivated her to work in various areas. Among these she found the laundromat to be very profitable. People go to the laundromat everyday to leave the clothes that they cannot wash because of time or work.  Susie noticed this need, and she took advantage of the opportunity to set up a small laundromat in her home.  In the beginning she only had one machine.  With much effort she now has three machines.  She does not want to be satisfied with what she has now.  She would like to open up branch laundromats.

She does all the arranging of the wedding cake, the wedding clothes, and the decorations.  In Uganda, it is traditional for special gift baskets to be prepared and given to the bride and groom in a very ceremonial way at the wedding.  These baskets should be covered with decorations that match the decorations at the rest of the wedding.  All of the cars involved in a wedding also have some ribbon tied around that matches the wedding\u2019s colors.  Proscovia is responsible for all of these arrangements.   <P>\r\n\r\nFor the wedding clothes, Proscovia has a dress that she rents out for 100,000 USH.  This allows her to make a large profit because she can either loan her own, which makes her the most money, or she can rent one from a friend for about 40,000 USH. This means that she can earn anywhere between 60,000 \u2013 100,000 USH just on the clothing for the wedding.    Then for decorations she can earn anywhere from 80,000 \u2013 100,000 profit per wedding.  <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia has 2 workers that help her with all of the arrangements needed for this business.    She also has a side business selling women\u2019s tops and bracelets.  She employs two people who sell these items for her in the surrounding markets.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia and her husband have 3 kids together that they care for, and she has one, who is the oldest, that is just hers and that she provides everything for.  With the money that she makes, she is now able to send this oldest girl to boarding school.  This is a dream come true for her.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia is requesting a loan of 700,000 USH to purchase two veils for weddings she is coordinating this month.

Little by little Porfirio came up with ways to grow his business.  He took advantage of seasonal products, selling items for Christmas, school, etc.\r\n\r\nAt 50 years old, he finally decided to open a storefront inside of a small commercial center in downtown Chosica.

Debido a que el negocio no iba a poder ser retomado, dividieron la inversi\u00f3n puesta en \u00e9l y cada una fue por su camino. \n\nCasiana pens\u00f3 que seria buena idea abrir una tienda en la casa donde viv\u00eda. A ra\u00edz de ello, su negocio son ha dejado de crecer. Hoy la tienda tiene cinco a\u00f1os y cada vez esta mas surtida. No solo vende abarrotes, tambi\u00e9n verduras y dulces. Hace un a\u00f1o y medio invirti\u00f3 en la instalaci\u00f3n de un peque\u00f1o locutorio en su tienda.\n\nAunque no le va nada mal en su negocio, Casiana tiene pensado cambiar su negocio por algo mas tranquilo, que no demande mucho esfuerzo f\u00edsico, puesto que es ella quien se encarga de hacer las compras de toda su mercader\u00eda, incluyendo la de las verduras.\n\nLas ganancias que obtiene de su negocio, ella la ahorra para poder construir su casa propia en el terreno que ya posee junto con su esposo. Sus cuatro hijos son mayores e independientes, por lo que ahora la prioridad es tener un hogar propio donde vivir con su esposo, quien trabaja como chofer.\n","en":"For six years Casiana worked selling all variety of shoes in the center of Chosica as a traveling saleswoman.  Later, she joined up with a friend of hers to start another business.\r\n\r\nFor a little time, then, she worked selling school and office supplies.  This business was going well until, unfortunately, her partner fell quite ill.  Because they weren't going to be able to continue with their business, they divided the investment they had put into it and each went her separate way.\r\n\r\nCasiana thought that it would be a good idea to open a store in the house where she lived.  As a result, her business has continued to grow.  Today she has been in business for five years, and her business is every day better stocked.  She not only sells groceries, but also vegetables and sweets.  A year and a half ago she invested in the installation of a little phone-center in her store.\r\n\r\nAlthough her business is going well, Casiana has thought about changing gears for something a little quieter that isn't so physically demanding, since she is the one who is responsible for buying all her merchandise, including the vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe saves the earnings from her business so she can construct her own house on a lot she already owns together with her husband.  Her four children are grown and independent, and now her priority is to have her own house where she and her husband, who works as a driver, can live.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":287428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T01:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Casiana,","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":155,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":38.75,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084994,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":38.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978478,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":77.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439365,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She has been working with the bank for eight years.  \r\n\r\nCurrently she continues with the same business of selling skewered meat at night and during the day, she sells prepared food. The business is located in her home, where she attends to retirees as if they were family, as well as to teachers and workers from \u201cESSalud.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe loan of  $475 will be repaid in 6 months. She will invest the funds in her business, buying tables, chairs, dishes, glasses, and pots and thus be able to provide more comfort and better attention to her customers. \r\n\r\nOn a personal level, Isabel feels more independent and responsible for the payment of her loan, and she knows how to make her own decisions.   \r\n\r\nIsabel is grateful to Manuela Ramos for allowing her to grow as a businesswoman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisette Artiga, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":287435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy tables, chairs, dishes, and kitchen utensils.

He began as a technician in a factory, and came to own a factory of his own after some years. Nevertheless, a moment arrived in which aluminum became scarce and prices began to rise in Peru, and he was forced to close his factory. A friend offered him a position in his factory of aluminum that was still going well, because in time that time to sell in Peru his friend exported a foreigner. Already retired from this profession, Juan is trying to become revitalized, to be able to operate or rent a mototaxi that he bought with the sale of his car. This idea occurred to one of his children, that sadly passed away three months ago at the age of forty-nine, because of an aneurysm. Juan's other two children live abroad, and they offer economic support to Juan and his wife when they need it. One of his children, who went to the U.S. thanks to a scholarship obtained from the state of California, now works for an insurance company and is the one who supports Juan more, and insists  that Juan and his wife come live with him in California. Juan is considering this move in the future. At his 74 years, he recently began to receive loans from EDAPROSPO, an affiliate of Kiva.

This is what her parents did, and, now, it is what she does. She has a small farm where her primary crop is avocados, which means that her business is intricately related to the avocado season.

She used to sell food to the tourists that visited her area, but now there are very few of them.\r\n\r\nAt 47 years old her principal expenses are for herself and her home, since her four children are already grown and only the youngest, age 20, is still a student.

Esta solicitando su 3er credito con urgencia, ya que desea construir 8 varas de tapia para evitar que el agua del patio vecino llegue a su casa, pues esto ha sido un constante problema para ella, porque en el invierno pasan con los pies mojados cada que llueve, la tapia completa es de 30 vras, pero iniciara con 8 que es lo mas urgente y despues si se puede continuara con el resto.  Manifiesta que se siente muy contenta con el apoyo que AFODENIC le ha brindado y la confianza que ha recibido de parte del personal, pues est\u00e1 dispuesta a continuar una excelente clienta y seguir manteniendo su record crediticio que es lo que todo cliente debe cuidar.","en":"Inocencia is 51 years old and single.  She has five children.  Four of them are married, and one daughter goes to high school.  Inocencia is in charge of the kitchen at the S.O.S Social Center.  She has worked there for fourteen years, from 6:30 am until 6:00 pm.  Three of her children live outside the country, and she receives help from them sporadically.  She is urgently applying for her 3rd loan because she wants to have eight wall sections put in to keep water from the neighboring patio from getting into her house.  This has been a constant problem for her because in the winter people walk around with wet feet every time it rains.  The completed wall will have thirty sections, but she is going to start with the eight that are the most pressing.  She will do the rest later if she is able to.  She is very happy with the support that AFODENIC has given her and the confidence that its personnel have shown in her.  She is ready to continue being an excellent client and maintain a good credit record, which she believes all clients should take care to do.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester,

She is a vegetable vendor at her age of 57 years old. She maintains a vegetable garden where she gets some of her products to be sold to her regular customers in their village. She is married to Narciso D.. They are blessed with 5 children namely; Laina, 38 years old, Narciso D. Jr., 36 years old, Leonardo, 34 years old, Leonalyn, 32 years old, and last is Nowella, 30 years old. Only her eldest child graduated from college and some did not due to financial difficulties and early marriage. <P>\r\n\r\nSince Leonila does not have a vending stall, she just roams around their village selling her different kinds of vegetable, some harvested in her garden while most are bought from the city market of Tuguegarao. Out of her vending business, Leonila is able to generate an income of PHP 750 weekly. She is thankful that through the business she is able to help her husband with their financial needs. She wants to request a loan amounting to PHP 5,000 which will be used in the improvement of her business and in venturing to other types of business where she could generate higher income.

Her family only rents the land where they live at PHP 500\/annum. Her primary customers were her neighbors & friends.<P>\r\n\r\n With the increasing demand of customers, she thought of expanding her business and joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative in June 2002 to gain access to their credit facilities. She is thankful to Paglaum MPC, that her purpose of accessing additional capital has materialized. Now, she is applying for PHP 14,900 to buy cases of soft drinks & beverages for sale.

This is Amina K., a 28-year-old, married woman from Mbeya.  She has two children, who are 5 and 9 years old.  In addition, she is responsible for supporting two other dependants, who are orphans. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2004, Amina has been operating a clothing sales business.  She purchases clothes at wholesale prices and then sells the clothes at retail prices for a profit.  She works at the business 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and she is assisted by two family members.  Amina currently earns approximately $150 per month from her business operations.  She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase more clothes in bulk for her business.  In the future, she plans to open a new business.  Amina thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

W.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!  This is Anna M., a 42-year-old woman from Mbeya.  She is single, and she has one child.  Since 2007, has been operating a crop-selling business: she purchases crops from the farming villages and then sells the crops in her town.  She works at her business 1-4 hours per day, 6 days per week, and she is assisted by one employee.  Anna currently earns approximately $380 per month from her business. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase a large quantity of crops from the village.  In the future, she plans to open the same business at a new location.  Anna thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional crops fpr resale purposes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna W.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.<P>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027614,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613615,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010694,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232980,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664771,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105483,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-15T21:52:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95072,"name":"Atuganile A.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!

This is Diana S., a 20-year-old woman from Mbeya.  She is married, and she has a 1-year-old child. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2005, Diana has been operating a clothing-sales business.  In particular, she purchases clothes at wholesale prices and then sells the clothes at retail prices for a profit.  She works at the business 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.  By doing so, Diana earns approximately $120 per month from her business.  She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase additional clothes in bulk.  In the future, she plans to open the same business at a new location.  Diana thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional clothing in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana J.

This is 38-year-old Dorah K. from Mbeya. She is single with 4 children between the ages of 4 and 15. Dorah has been running a soap-making business since 2007. In her business, she purchases raw materials like red palm oil and caustic and makes soap, which she then supplies to shops and homes.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business 12 hours each day, 4 days per week and is assisted by one employee and her brother. Dorah currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD to expand her business by purchasing more red palm oil, white palm oil, and caustic soda so she can produce more soap in bulk for resale. In the future, she plans to increase the range of her business. Dorah thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna N.

This is 50-year-old Eddah M. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 11 and 18. Eddah has been running a soft-drinks and poultry-keeping business since 2000. She purchases drinks wholesale then sells them retail, and she keeps chickens. She works at the business 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by 4 employees. Eddah currently earns about $350 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $700 USD in order to purchase soft drinks and poultry feed in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the number and variety of products in her business. Eddah thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It is simultaneously a very affordable way to get a ride and a tough way to make a living. If Nicholas is able to make a profit, he hopes to expand and purchase a poultry coup to provide extra food and security for his family and maybe sell eggs. He is concerned that he will be driven out of business by those in the \"piki-piki\" (motorbike) business. <P>\r\n\r\nNicholas recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW he will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of his community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. His work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health

Her husband died two years ago and she is raising her two kids alone. She is HIV positive and says that it is a challenge raising two kids alone in addition to running her business. She sells items like maize, beans, and rice in Kisumu from a small stall and uses the profits to pay for her boy\u2019s schooling. She plans on sending her daughter when she is old enough. This is her first loan and in part, it will be used to offset transportation costs associated with bringing her food to the market.<p>\r\n\r\nElizabeth recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illness.

A. is a 19-year-old mother of two children aged 6 and 3, and is raising them alone. The older child is already in school. She sells small fish called Omena and has been running her business for 6 years. This is her first loan. She hopes to receive the loan as it will allow her to buy fish from a cheaper seller, albeit one located farther from the market. She says the business helps her and her children, and the profits will be used to pay for their school fees. <p>\r\n\r\nWinnie recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illness. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and

She will use this loan to purchase more cereal so that she can sell to more schools. Her husband also works as a businessman. When asked about what else she would like to share with potential lenders, she wanted to let everyone know she has been saved (by Jesus), likes socializing and likes people who talk progressively and don\u2019t gossip.<p>\r\n\r\nMercy recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illness.

Kayunga is about 2 hours north-east of Kampala.  Suzan sells books, record books, different kinds of paper, pens, chalk, and other such things at her shop.     <p>\r\nSuzan is requesting a loan of 400,000 Uganda Shillings (USH) to restock her store.  This will be her second loan and she is already seeing a change in her life because of the loans she is taking.  Previously, she was only making about 20,000 USH per week, but now she makes more like 30,000 USH per week.  She explains that this is because of two factors; first, she is able to purchase the items in her shop for less money because she can buy them in bulk, and second, because she is able to have more items so more customers come to her shop.    <p>\r\nSuzan has four children and no husband.  The fathers of the children help her with paying school fees for their children, but they offer no support for the children\u2019s daily lives.  Now, with the profit that she is making in her business, she is able to cover her share of the school fees as well as make her children comfortable when they are at home.

They are close neighbours with a lot of experience in their daily activities.  The group is consists of the following members; \r\n\r\nBessy Rodrigues is 40 years old, she has had a business making and selling tortillas for the past year.  She gets up at 5am to begin her production and then she sells the tortillas from 7am till midday.  She also sells dairy products.  Previously she has a cafeteria where she used to sell sweets and snacks, but she had some problems and she had to give up the business, and now she wants to start again in order to keep moving forward.  \r\n\r\nHeimy is 22 years old and she has spent the last two years selling jewellery such as earrings, rings and watches.  She also sells purses, wallets, shoes and silver chains.  Since she was a small child, she has liked retail sales, and previously she worked as a sales assistant in a private company, but then she decided it would be better to set-up her own business and only have to work for herself.  She also decided to do this because she didn't have anybody to look after her son, and paying for a nanny was very expensive.  Her husband works in Cafe Maya, a private company.  He travels every week to distribute coffee in various communities.  She needs the credit in order to purchase fabric to make wallets, buy perfume scents and underwear.  Her short term aim is to have a big business.  \r\n\r\nRoxana V. is 28 years old, she has 2 years experience with her business.  She sells shoes for women, wallets, curtains, rucksacks, lotion sets, jeans, shirts and sneakers.  She has three children.  She has a lot of faithful customers who visit her in her house to buy these products. She is very friendly and sociable, and as these are characteristics that not everyone has, this is why her customers seek her out.

Now that her children are grown and married she has accomplished her goal of an established locale, since she is older now and it is tiring work to sell door-to-door or as a traveling salesperson. Thanks to the business she has been able to build two other small commercial shops, which she rents out to other business owners.  \r\n\r\nNow she requires a loan of $12,000 MXN to pay back in 12 installments to buy merchandise such as gifts and novelties in order to have a varied inventory for her business and offer the best selection to her clients.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

enjoyed sales. At the time she had been laid-off so she had time on her hands, plus she wanted to contribute to the family income. She began the business in March of 2005 with a little table in her garage and in no time she had many customers since there was no other business near her home that sold food in the mornings. One customer suggested she find a locale on the neighborhood\u2019s main avenue to be better situated, which put her about half a block from her house. Since then she has done even better. Slowly she has financed her business and has been able to buy needed items such as better cooking pots, tables and chairs for the customers' enjoyment of her food, as well as a bigger stove and an umbrella for protection from the sun and rain. She needs a loan of $4000 MXN, to be repaid in 10 installments, in order to buy raw cooking materials such as meat, tortillas, vegetables, French bread, oil, beans, disposable glasses and plates, etc. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":287624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To buy raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037343,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037344,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927762,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927763,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382827,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382828,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889504,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889505,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110999,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":436.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111000,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-21T05:42:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":95124,"name":"Wassim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wassim is a 24-year-old man who lives in Tripoli, in northern Lebanon.

She has worked as a teacher for the past 10 years, and also meets the expenses of her parents as they have very few economic resources and many commitments.

Who or what are\"\u2018kuku,\" you may ask. \"Kuku\" means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two chickens and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally. \r\nSecond, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing. they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular. Maybe they are friendlier than other animals -- or prettier, but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n\r\nFlora works at the business for 13 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Irene thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber
