She has a point-of-sale in a big local market. It has been 8 years since she started her business, and she has a lot of experience. She wants to get a loan to increase the range of goods and to decrease the markup for goods she sells. Muborak is going to buy school uniforms because the school fair season is coming and such goods will have a big demand in the market. Later on Muborak will change the range of goods again for winter clothes. Parents can purchase the clothes for their children in the district market instead of attending the capital city markets during the year and will save their time and

A staff reduction left her without work, but she was indemnified, and with the money she opened up a store in her home to serve as the family's source of income. Along with this, she took up making baby's clothing. Through these activies she had a decent life and could feed her kids and provide them with a good education. Her store has good earnings, since this year her clientele has increased, and at times it has been difficult to have a supply that meets the demand. To correct this situation, Angelica is requesting a loan of $200, which she plans to use to purchase necessary supplies in larger quantities, like flour, sugar, rice, noodles and oil, because those are in the highest demand at her shop.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa Sra.

To increase her earnings, Nidia is requesting a loan of $200 so she can purchase rice, surgar, oil and drinks at wholsale.

Now Mr. Dong has found buyers in Hanoi, and things have really taken off. Mrs. H. and her husband have 8 people working for them to make partitions and fences. They also organise getting the bamboo from nearby plantations, and Mr. Dong goes to Hanoi once a month to make sure everything is sold at a fair price.

Currently, Run P. is humbly asking for a loan of $600 to increase her livestock by adding more pigs and cows. She loves this kind of animal breeding, because it enables her to increase her family savings in a very short time. For instance, with pig breeding, she uses the waste from the winemaking to feed them, because whenever they are fed like this, they fall deeply asleep, which enables them to grow very fast. In the future, she dreams of being able to increase even more the amount of pigs and cows she has, and as a result, make more profit and give her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":45725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To increase her

Heng C. is 31 years old and lives in Siem Reap Province with her husband (pictured here because Heng Charthy was working in Poipet when we visited) and their 2 young children.  She buys and sells small baskets and other handmade items near the Cambodian-Thailand border in the city of Poipet.  Her husband works as a driver for a private company and can earn $3\/day.  Mrs. Heng C. currently earns $3\/day in her business, but would like to have this loan in order to buy a motorbike.  With the new motorbike, she will be able to transport her baskets to new markets and earn more income.
