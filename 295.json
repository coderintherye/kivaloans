She is married and has five school-aged children.\r\n\r\nSina owns and operates a business making and selling food, selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.\r\n\r\nSina is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will again be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nSina is not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 29th September 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 38 -year-old woman.  She lives in the town of Faleasiu.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Vaifoa owns & operates a business in the agriculture sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Vaifoa has been engaged in this business for over 4 years.  From these activities, Vaifoa earns approximately $500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaifoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Vaifoa is requesting a loan from SPBD.  A previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST.  The current loan will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Varifoa from SPBD.  Vaifoa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nVaifoa is not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 35-year-old woman living in the town of Faleasiu.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Sina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sina has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately $550 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sina has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Sina is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST which will again be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Sina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nSina is not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It is a purely agricultural area located an hour from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nHe has been mainly working in agriculture and ranching since childhood. He currently is raising sheep and pigs, which are then sold at the market in Moshoqueque in Chiclayo. This business is one source of income for his home, but does not provide the stability to keep them going.  This is why he has turned to another activity which he has worked at for 18 years: fishing.  During the fishing season he travels with his brothers to San Jose creek to catch fish and then sell it to his neighbors. The area where he lives is far from the sea so this business is very profitable. \r\n\r\nAurelio is thinking about devoting even more time to his fish business and plans to buy more fish. In addition to selling to his neighbors he would like to sell in the surrounding areas. For this reason he is applying for the first time to Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nHe is hardworking and has previously worked as a taxi driver and has always studied how to make electrical connections and bathroom fittings. He is always thinking of ways to support his family and takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him. \r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to secure a source of work that would provide the stability for his family that they need to succeed. He also dreams of traveling to Spain to work and from there support his family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva

N. is from the village of Brgy. 24, Gingoog City. He is 43 years old. Joseph is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Joseph runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Joseph has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippines pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joseph joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joseph has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Joseph is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the third loan taken out by Joseph from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of his children, to pay bills and for land installments. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":413553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

R. is from the village of Manticao, Iligan City.

Rodel has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodel is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rodel from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

O. is from the city of Gingoog City. She is 50 years old. Jella is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Jella owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling peanut butter in the local community. She also runs a pig farm. Jella has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 1200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jella joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Jella is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional working capital for making peanut butter, as well as two piglets. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jella from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family and purchase additional feed for her pigs. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He is 40, and he is married to the love of his life, Maribel, who is 35.  They have two sons; Luis is 16 and Jes\u00fas is 13.  He feels proud of his family.  \r\n\r\nIt is for them that he does his best everyday to work on each one of the facades that he needs to paint for the big companies.  He does this job alone, and he remolds each structure that he needs to paint as if it were his own house.  It does not matter if he has to work from high walls.  The important thing is to leave them sparkling.  Luis leaves the facades so well painted that the businesses have contracted him.  That gives him the luxury of taking a before and after photo to show to new customers.  They are surprised when they look at the photos, and it encourages them to hire him.  \r\n\r\nThe business is very profitable because there are always businesses that want to improve their institutional look.  The fa\u00e7ade is the first impression of a place.  That is why Luis knows how to take advantage of this necessity.  He has future plans to put a shop in his house.  That would be the center of operations, and he would hire other people to help him in providing his services.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  He is more than happy with the results of each investment.  That is why he is very responsible with each one of his payments.  He already has almost everything ready for the shop.

She is 25 years old. Evangeline is single and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Evangeline owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling grilled meat (alacarte) such as chicken feet, chicken legs, chicken intestines, pork and others in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evangeline joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from HSPFI. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Evangeline from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business and supplement income for the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Some of the vegetables that she sells come from their own harvest. Her income is not enough to meet the demands of her customers, however; consequently, in order to improve her vending business, she is asking for a loan from Kiva lenders amounting to PHP 8,000.00.

L. is from the village of Tangaro, Catarman Camiguin Province. She is 41 years old. Violeta is widowed and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Violeta runs a business in the service sector. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transport services to community members with her pedicab vehicle. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Violeta joined HSPFI in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Violeta is requesting the same amount (that is, 11,000 PHP), which will be used to purchase materials to improve her business. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Violeta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L., 46, has been providing her neighbors, and even friends abroad, with her home-made cured fish for almost three years now. She lives in Zabarte, Caloocan City. Her 53 year old husband, Ireneo, is an auto electrician. Their only child is still in grade school.\r\n\r\nLorence carefully debones bangus (milkfish - the country\u2019s national fish) and cures them for longer shelf life. Her finished products appeal to a lot to her customers so that she always finds herself working overtime to meet their demands. Her cured bangus now reaches her friends overseas at an additional fee for handling. In addition, she also delivers fresh pork meat to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nLorence is thankful to the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative for providing her with loans which she has used to buy fresh bangus in bulk. She now earns at least P9,000 a month but her earnings sometimes vary depending on the supply of fresh meat and fish and the demand for finished products.\r\n\r\nLorence uses her profits to support the daily needs of her family, especially her child\u2019s education. She applied for a new loan of P17,000 from CCT Credit Cooperative. She wishes to come up with an appealing packaging for her cured fish for better marketability. She also wishes that her products qualify for the export standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

M. (shown here with her young students) is 43 years old and lives and works in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City. Her husband Danilo makes a living as a driver, and they have two children.\r\n\r\nMarites runs a community pre-school. She also established and manages a canteen located inside the school. On slow days at school, she supplements her income by selling cosmetics and apparel. With all these businesses, she makes close to PHP7,000 a month. \r\n\r\nMarites joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  Her profits, when added to loans provided by the cooperative, have helped her improve her school. She has repaid several loans, and has now applied for a new one for PHP26,000. She will use this loan to buy food to sell at her canteen.\r\n\r\nMarites hopes to expand her school and improve its reputation so that it is known not just in her community, but in neighboring ones as well.    \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is Christian response to poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

She joined ASHI, a KIVA field partner in the Philippines, to be able to access a loan. This opportunity will enable her to put up her own business, bandi making (coconut candy making), and be economically independent from her husband who is a farmer. Bandi is one of the famous delicacies of Antique province. Most of the customers buying this delicacy are tourists and they are buying bandi for a present when they go home to their own places. Profits she will be getting out of this business will be her means to augment her husband\u2019s sporadic income. Most of her earnings will be saved for her and her husband\u2019s needs in the future and some will be used to support her children\u2019s family, which is also poor. Though her children no longer live with her, she can\u2019t afford seeing them suffer because of poverty. Through loans she can request, she believes that the business she\u2019ll be financing will bring change to her family's lives.

Q. is from the village of Sto.

To make a living, Betty owns a specialized retail store where her main source of income is from selling vegetables. Betty has been engaged in her business for over three years and she earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Betty joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Betty successfully repaid her last loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. She used this previous loan to expand her business. Betty is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which she will use as additional capital for her business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Betty from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Merbaun Village is situated about 42 km from Kupang City. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is led by Herman T., a 36-year-old married man with three adorable children: Astri T., 14, in the second grade of junior high school; Zamrud, 5, in kindergarten; and Maria, 1. Herman and his family have lived in Merbaun Village for years. As the head of his family, Herman is responsible for meeting their daily needs. Therefore, he has been working as a truck driver for 14 years, usually delivering sand and stones for his customers. The income that he earns from this work is unstable as it depends on orders from customers. Besides working as a truck driver, Herman cultivates banana and coconuts on his farm, but he is only able to sell these products every six months. By selling agricultural products, he can only generate a small amount of income. Herman realizes that his children are growing up and they will need more and more money, both for their education as well as their daily needs. \r\n<p>\r\nHerman needs to find another way to support his family. He saw that his neighbors had joined the Cattle Fattening Program of Kiva partner TLM and after several cycles of this program they were able to better provide for their families. He got information from a relative about the TLM Cattle Fattening Program, which assists poor farmers in West Timor by providing a loan to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period.

Merbaun Village is situated about 42 km from Kupang City, the capital city of East Nusa Tenggara Province. The last 6 km of road used to enter Merbaun Village is in a really bad condition. This is why it takes about two hours to drive from Kupang City to Merbaun. \r\n<p>\r\nThere are many coconut, banana and betel nut trees growing in Merbaun Village. The local community relies on the agricultural sector to support their families. The challenge for the Merbaun community is the availability of public transport in the village. Such transport is only available twice a week, limiting the opportunities farmers have for going to market to sell their products. Generally, the houses in this area are constructed simply and have no electricity supply. Even though electricity is available in this area, the community cannot afford it as the installation cost is quite expensive. \r\n<p>\r\nNekaruut B group is led by a 33-year-old farmer, Ferdinan P.. He is married and blessed with two children: Marthen P., 9, in the third grade of elementary school, and Iwan P., 7, in the first grade of elementary school. Like many other farmers, Ferdinan relies on farming to generate money to meet his family's needs. He usually sells coconuts and bananas from his own farm at the market. Sometimes the coconuts and bananas that Ferdinan brings to the market do not all sell, and he has to bring them back to the village and sell them at a cheaper price. This is the only way for him to make money as he doesn\u2019t have any other business. For two years Ferdinan fattened cattle owned by an entrepreneur from Kupang, but he felt that the fee was insufficient to meet his family's needs. He really wants to better provide for his family but his lack of capital is the main issue. \r\n<p>\r\nThe situation that Ferdinan faces motivated him to join the TLM cattle-fattening program. The hope for a better future and his experience in fattening cattle has given him the self-confidence to join the program. Ferdinan is requesting a loan of 3,400,000 IDR from Kiva partner TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in 12 months. He hopes that this loan will help him better meet his family's needs. The other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle. They hope their loans lead them to a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":414127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Merbaun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-10-29T00:58:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ferdinan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oktoviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asnat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27000000,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2875,"local_amount":27000000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":27096874.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166921836,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-30T23:58:24Z","paid_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147542,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edwin D. is 30 years old and owns and manages a small rice field in Kapatungan, Trento, Agusan del Sur.

R. is a 38 year old man. He leads the Kanaan A Group, which is composed of 8 people in Erbaun Village, East Amarasi Sub district, Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Erbaun Village is situated for about 52 Km from Kupang City near to the eastern coast of Timor Island. This village can be categorized as a remote village. The road leading to this village is in bad condition with many holes on it. This makes it difficult for public transportation to enter the village. Only trucks enter, but even they are only available once a week. \r\n\r\nMost of the community in Erbaun village relies on farming to generate income in order to meet their family's needs. But a part of the community, especially those living in coastal area, also try to dig sand to sell as the quality of sand in this village is quite good. This is another way for them to generate money.\r\n\r\nAsin has been living in Erbaun Village since he was a child. Due to his parents' poverty, Asin was only able to have primary education. Consequently, he had to become a farmer because no other jobs were available to him.\r\n\r\nAsin is a married to a 30 year old woman named Elkana. They have been blessed with two children. They are: Mesrin, 6 years old, in the first grade of elementary school, and Vivi, 4 years old and thus not at school yet.\r\n\r\nAsin lives close to the coast. He and family live in a modest house, where the roof is made of palm leaves, the walls are composed of palm branches, the floor is mere dirt and there is no electricity. Asin likes farming better than digging sand as farming is his hobby. He usually sells bananas and coconuts at Inpres market in Kupang City once a week. His wife also helps him in generating money by selling their products. Even though both of them have worked hard to generate money, the income is only enough to meet their daily needs. They cannot save money. Asin and his wife are also challenged by competition in selling their goods.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Asin is interested in joining a cattle fattening program with the other group members.

B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kanaan B Group is a group of 7 farmers in Erbaun Village, Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Erbaun is a remote village which is situated about 52 Km from the capital city of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Similar to many other rural areas in West Timor, most of community in Erbaun Village supports their family life by farming. \r\n\r\nKanaan B Group is led by Apsalom R., a 26 year old single man. He has been living in Erbaun Village since he was a child. In Erbaun, Apsalom lives with his parents and two of his sisters in their modest house constructed with a palm leaf roof, branch wall and dirt floor. His father, aged 65 years and his mother, aged 60 years, are both poor farmers. They couldn\u2019t afford to finance Apsalom\u2019s education. As a result, Apsalom couldn\u2019t complete his primary school. He only attended school up to the second grade of primary school. Apsalom then chose to help his parents in farming. He has to work hard to help his parents and to finance his sisters. \r\n\r\nApsalom works everyday at the farm. He sells agriculture produce such as coconuts and bananas at the market. The income generated from selling these produce is given to his parents to cover their daily needs. To better meet his family needs, Apsalom once joined with the local fisherman for fishing. But it was only for a year. After that he became a truck driver for some time. Apsalom then moved to Kupang City and worked as a building laborer. The reason why Apsalom chose these types of work is because his parents are getting older and he doesn\u2019t have a heart to let his parents work hard to bring their coconuts and bananas from the farm to the market to sell at their advanced age.\r\n\r\nAccording to Apsalom, currently the profits from the farm are lower than usual. As a result, the income generated from selling coconuts and bananas is sometimes insufficient to cover the family needs. His experience as a building laborer in Kupang City helps him in generating some money when a community member asks him to repair their house. But this is an irregular income source for him.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties that Apsalom faces have motivated him to find another way to support his parents and his sisters. One of the alternatives that have become his preference is to raise and fatten cattle. To raise cattle, Apsalom needs capital to buy the young cattle and he can not afford it as poor farmer. This is the reason why Apsalom is interesting in joining the cattle fattening program. Together with the other members of Kanaan B Group, they are requesting a loan to buy young cattle to be raised and fattened over a 12 month period. Apsalom is requesting a loan of IDR 3,400,000. He hopes that this loan will help him in better providing his parents and sisters needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":414139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be raised and fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Erbaun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-10-26T22:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apsalom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hanok","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Son","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":23700000,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":23700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1800.53,"local_amount":16900000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16969970.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182619971,"comment":null},{"amount":724.47,"local_amount":6800000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6828154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222028362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T00:30:47Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T08:04:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147547,"name":"Kodi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kodi A. is currently in the business of brewing and selling local alcohol and is requesting a loan to purchase more yeast and sugar for brewing.

is forty years old.

Since the agreement's inception in December 2008, 120 parents have received financing in amounts varying from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

In this way, she will be able to see her profits rise by 20,000 francs per month. Ms. Fama M. is a beneficiary of the agreement between U-IMCEC (one of Kiva's field partners) and the Program for the Development of Children and Families (PDEF in French) Seydina Issa Laye.

Thanks to this cooperation, the parents of these children can benefit from loans having more flexible terms, as compared to ordinary loans.

She is single and has four adult children who help support her economically. She works as a seamstress which she learned as a young girl. Through many years of experience she has learned how to sew high quality garments and modern styles and gained a clientele. She has 16 years experience sewing and thanks God that through this job she was able to raise her children and watch them grow up because she ran her business out of her home. She makes sheets, embroidered covers and pillowcases, dresses for girls, and other orders made by clients. With this loan she will purchase fabric and embroidery and take advantage of the season. With the  profits she hopes to begin building a wall around her home to offer better security. Her home is currently made half of stone and half of wooden boards, but it is her own home and she hopes to build it with concrete in the future.

At the beginning it was very hard and she was at the point of losing her business. But after seeing her children who needed her, she gathered her strength and took up her business again. \r\nApart from her small restaurant, she is about to start up a business selling cleaning products, which she hopes will go well.\r\nHowever, she is always thinking about her children's future and she works hard to give them a good education. For this reason she has set her next goal to sell juices and yogurt which she has already completed training to do. With this initiative and with her current business she can begin to put together some capital. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3075,"image":{"id":414488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of products for her future juice store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soledad Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Celinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8750,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2187.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2187.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2187.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":768.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":768.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":768.75,"local_amount":2187.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2198.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780215,"comment":null},{"amount":461.25,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669084,"comment":null},{"amount":1845,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5276.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T01:06:04Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":147745,"name":"Dennys Maradiaga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dennys sells fruit and vegetables to his customers.
