","en":"The Takku Liguey group came into being during a literacy class in which a unit on creating and running a micro-enterprise was taught. In order to put the acquired theoretical knowledge into practice and at the same time increase their income, five women from the class organized themselves into a group and got started earning income. \n\nThe majority of them sold cooked food in front of their respective houses where they offered breakfast or lunch to their customers, with dishes using locally processed cereals. These activities allowed them to satisfy their individual needs and also to help their husbands support their families. \n\nMuch younger than the other group members, the group leader (who is raising her hand in the photo) is 30 years old. She has a table in front of her house where she sells food, and receives clients who come to her neighborhood seeking work. She started her activity 3 months ago but is already making profits that allow her not only to support her husband in order to considerably improve the quality of food her family eats, but also and especially to meet her own needs.\n\nThey opened an account at IMCEC and after having saved for two months, they are asking for a loan of 300,000 F to buy millet, beans, onions, potatoes, and other various products. Their ambition is to put up real buildings  to serve as little restaurants instead of the open-air tables they presently use which pose a problem of hygiene.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

lives and works in Isfara, Tajikistan.

Solijon would like to get a loan of US $2100 to purchase apricots to process and make a good profit.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

age 45, lives with her family in a ger (a traditional Mongolian felt tent) in the outer ger districts of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her husband is a construction worker at a local company while her son works at a cashmere manufacturing company. Her 4-year-old daughter attends kindergarten.\r\n \r\nErdenetsooj has been operating a cooperative felt-manufacturing business since 2006 with 24 partners.

Kyrgyzstan). He is married and has three daughters, the eldest of which is 17 years old. Mirgazy born into a simple farmer's family. He was the eldest of the brothers, and so most of his time was devoted to household chores, helping his father care for the cattle. At the end of the ninth grade, Mirgazy entered the College of Food in Karabalta (in the Chuy region of Kyrgyzstan), studying  grain production. \n\nAfter graduating from college in 1996, he was drafted into the army, where he served for a year and a half. After serving, Mirgazy came to his village and went to work as a farm mechanic. His work on the farm did not last long.  Because of low wages, he resigned and took a job for the city Karabalta.

These stocks in trade have endeared her not only to her laborers but also her clients. As such, she has been notching up successes in her transactions the last six years since she took root. Every business has its downsides and quarry businesses are invariably fraught with them, including 38-year-old Harriet's but her unwavering tenacity has been her recourse. The experience mill she has gone through in this business has taught her a lot. She says laying great store on patience has been key. Her business was thrown into gear after a pep talk by close friends and family. Before that, she was mostly preoccupied by tailoring. She has been carving out a niche gradually and she reckons her future prospects will only get better with time. Her clientele base principally consists of middle class civil servants beginning to build and construction firm people.\r\n\r\nHarriet who is a married mother of three says her gross weekly sales revenue is to the tune of Ugandan shillings 40,000. This may be paltry, but she says by the end of this year, she expects to be making more. By all accounts, this is the group's maiden loan from Pearl Micro-finance. The integrity of the other group members is something Harriet speaks highly of and she does not expect any difficulty in repaying their loan. Given Harriet's tenacity, diligence, optimism and good working relationships, her odds of business success look good. This Kiva loan she anticipates will throw her business in an even stronger gear.

Khaukharkull and her husband are doctors. They work in the hospital in the village of Gull, and they enjoy prestige and respect among the villagers.

She will use the money she\u2019s requesting to continue to invest in merchandise both in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":827107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more perishables to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-03T23:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":146.09},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":177.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":185.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.78,"local_amount":146.09,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350817,"comment":null},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":158.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":162.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851164,"comment":null},{"amount":61.06,"local_amount":162.84,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666340,"comment":null},{"amount":63.82,"local_amount":170.17,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":174.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621497,"comment":null},{"amount":66.48,"local_amount":177.28,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":182.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835570,"comment":null},{"amount":69.48,"local_amount":185.29,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":190.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245339,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T09:51:06Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323011,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nCliente agee de 47 ans, veuve et mere de 5 enfants dont l'age varie entre 14 et 28 ans.\nAvec un niveau d'etudes primaire , elle se lance dans la vente en detail de l' haricot et des sandales en plastiques.

She\u2019s a widow and has two children living with her in her own house.  After her husband\u2019s death she felt the need to strive to support her children through farming, raising livestock and doing embroidery even more strongly.  She managed to move them ahead.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the pace of her work does not slow down because she has to continue rising at dawn every day to cut grass to feed her cows and she frequently goes to check on her fields to insure that her crops are growing optimally and to avoid their being attacked by insect infestations that will damage production.  Occasionally, she sells the offspring of her cows, especially if they are males.  Alongside all the field work, she also does artisanal embroidery on a regular basis that is very much in demand during the festive occasions in her zone.

Thirteen years ago, Zenaida and her husband decided to make use of the inheritances they received from both of their families by establishing a brickyard and using the clay that was available on their land.
