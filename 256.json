This loan will be her 4th from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She made a loan then, which she used as capital to start up her fish selling business.

Now, her business has grown and requires a larger amount of capital. Thus, Rhea Joy's loan amounting to Php 24,000 is intended for this purpose. Since fish is in demand, she wants to increase her inventory of it and also wants to finance her variety store.\r\n\r\nBy obtaining loans and being a member of ASHI, Rhea Joy wishes to make her business more stable and sustainable.

He now faces a small problem because his field has infertile soil. He decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field. With the rest of the money, he will hire a laborer to plow the field. His wife, Mrs. Khon Khaem, also helps him with planting. Mr. Mus N. is 46 years old and the father of four children who are all attending the local school. \r\n\r\nFourteen members in this group loans are End-of-Term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-Term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

C. is from the village of Taglimao, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 48 years old. Leonisa is separated from her spouse. To make a living, Leonisa owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Leonisa has been in business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leonisa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

She decided to join the Fresno credit group because this group was formed with people from her own community which she knew and respected very much. The main investment of the majority of the members in this group is the cultivation of Hass avocado orchards where they want to cultivate new plants and renew or nourish those already established so that they yield more and better quality fruit. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe is 19 years old, is a happy girl that in spite of her young age has many dreams and goals. She studied in High School but now does not have the opportunity to continue her studies because of the distance to the school and the expense incurred by her parents of going to an institution of higher learning.  It has been several years since she developed an interest in starting a business that would permit her to obtain income. \r\n\r\nHer main desire is to start a fast food restaurant in the industrial zone of the city of Zitacuaro. She thinks that this is the right place to undertake her business activity because she has worked there for a year and noticed that the workers in the area look for places to eat nearby because they do not have enough time to go to the center of Zitacuaro or to their homes to eat. She has thought of using the credit to buy a table, a parasol, plates, glasses, a cast iron pan for grilling, raw materials and all that is necessary to begin this fast food business. Guadalupe visualizes a profitable business that offers clean, flavorful and economical food to her diners who will be mainly workers in the manufacturing zone.

T. is from the village of Danao. She is 38 years old. Nida is married. To make a living, Nida operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Nida has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (about $63) a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Nida joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Nida is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fishing nets. This will be the third loan taken out by Nida from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josephin is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Josephin joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Josephin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 13th loan taken out by Josephin from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Fasitoo Tai. She is married and has four small children. Soloi makes and sells food for a living: the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community. Soloi has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 300 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Soloi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. She wished to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. This is the first time she has requested a loan from SPBD. She is requesting 1,000 WST, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make baked products for sale.  Soloi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Ela is requesting a loan from SPBD in the amount of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be her first loan taken out from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business venture.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

A. is a 44-year-old woman who lives in Lalovaea village. She is married and has one grown child.  To make a living, Senia owns and operates a food stall where she sells many different types of products. She has been engaged in this business for more than one year and earns approximately $500 WST a month from her work.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Senia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services that can improve her life and business. She is applying for her first loan from SPBD to buy additional products to sell. Senia plans to use the additional revenue made possible by this loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this business for more than two years, and earns about $700 WST a month from her work.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Havea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and business.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is a 47-year-old woman who lives in the town of Lotofaga Aleipata B. She is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Filomena runs a banana plantation. She has been engaged in this business for more than five years, and earns about $500 WST a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Filomena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and her business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1,750 WST from SPBD. She used this loan to buy fertilizer. Now she is applying for a new loan of $2,250 WST which she will use to buy additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Filomena plans to use the additional income made possible by this loan to continue to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is Taumaia U.. She is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiee. She is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Taumaia operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. Her main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting taro for sale. Taumaia has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 550 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Taumaia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her wish was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Taumaia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  \r\n<p>\r\nTaumaia is now requesting a new loan of 1,750 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This will be the fourth loan she has taken out from SPBD. Taumaia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M., 29 years old, lives in the town of Lotofaga Alasopo. She is married and has a baby. To make a living, Foliga operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. Her main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting taro for sale. Foliga has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 550 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Foliga joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Foliga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFoliga is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be her second loan from SPBD. Foliga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F., age 49, lives in the town of Nonoa. She is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Molimaufou owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Molimaufou has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Molimaufou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Molimaufou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nMolimaufou is now requesting a new loan of 2,000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be her third loan from SPBD. Molimaufou plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Sofia operates a family member's business venture in the manufacturing sector, manufacturing and selling leather products to local businesses and community members. Sofia has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Sofia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Sofia is now requesting her first loan from SPBD in the amount of 1,000 WST, which will be used for working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Sofia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Nonoa. She is married and has five school-aged children.  To make a living, Faasu owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. Her main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Faasu has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Faasu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Faasu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFaasu is now requesting a new loan of 1,800 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. The loan will be the third loan she has taken out from SPBD. Faasu plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Mulifanua.  She is married and has 6 school-aged children.  To make a living, Lalotea operates a fishing business.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Lalotea has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 650 Samoan tala (about $246 US)  a month from these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2005, Lalotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lalotea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase a fishing boat.  Lalotea is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her third from SPBD.  Lalotea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

U. (0) is a 62-year-old woman living in the town of Fusi Saoluafata. She is married and has seven adult children.\r\n\r\nSalafai owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting taro for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 700 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Salafai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.\r\n\r\nSalafai is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Epi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.\r\n\r\nEpi is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 5th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

S. is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Tuanai A.

She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faavae joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,100 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nFaavae is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will again be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. The loan will be her 3rd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

M. is a 34-year-old woman who lives in the town of Samalaeulu Leauvaa. She is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Leagaioalii plants, harvests, and sells bananas. Leagaioalii has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leagaioalii joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Leagaioalii has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Leagaioalii is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be Leagaioalii's 4th loan from SPBD.  Leagaioalii plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Segifili is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Samalaeulu Leauvaa. She is married and has 5 adult children. Faafotu owns & operates a business venture raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Faafotu has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faafotu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to engage in business activities. Faafotu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. The previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Faafotu is requesting a new loan, of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. This will be the second loan taken out by Faafotu from SPBD. Faafotu plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

F. (10100006977) is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Faleseela. She is single and does not have any children. Pelenatete operates a family member's business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting taro for sale. Pelenatete has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pelenatete joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Pelenatete is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD. Pelenatete is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST to be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This will be the first loan taken out by Pelenatete from SPBD. Pelenatete plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

A. is a 40-year-old woman living in the town of Samalaeulu Leauvaa. She is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Matalena raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Matalena has been engaged in this business for more than three years and earns approximately 360 Samoa Tala (about $136) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matalena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Matalena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Matalena is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Matalena plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

R. is a 26-year-old woman living in the town of Faleseela. She is married and has two infant children. To make a living, Sileiloa operates a family member's business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting taro for sale. Sileiloa has been engaged in this business for more than three years and earns approximately 250 Samoa Tala (about $94) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sileiloa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sileiloa is requesting a loan from SPBD for the first time of 1,000 WST, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Sileiloa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

E. is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Salepouae. She is married and has four young children. To make a living, Malagaleupolu operates a business selling agricultural equipment. The main source of income for the business comes from selling plant seedlings and young crops to local farmers. Malagaleupolu has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 350 Samoa Tala (about $132) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malagaleupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Malagaleupolu is requesting a loan from SPBD of 750 WST, which will be used to purchase general agricultural supplies and equipment. This will be the first loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Malagaleupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Fa owns & operates a business selling baked goods in the local community.

Fa is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD of 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her products for sale.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Fa from SPBD.  Fa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

V. is a 28-year-old woman living in the town of Utualii.  She is married and has three infant children.  To make a living, Salefaia owns & operates a business planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Salefaia has been engaged in this business for over one year and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Salefaia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Salefaia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to rent land to raise additional crops.  Salefaia is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Salefaia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Naotala owns & operates a business planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Naotala has been engaged in this business for over 17 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nNaotala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Naotala has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  Naotala is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST, which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out Naotala from SPBD.  Naotala plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is a 54-year-old woman living in the town of Salepouae.  She is married and has eight adult children.  To make a living, Faalevela owns & operates a general store, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Faalevela has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Faalevela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faalevela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3950 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Faalevela is now requesting a new loan of 3250 WST, which will be used to invest in renovating the business.  The loan will be the sixth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faalevela plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":366850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

To make a living, Ulalia owns & operates a business manufacturing & selling clothing products to local businesses and community members.  Ulalia has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nUlalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ulalia has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  Ulalia is now requesting a new loan of 2400 WST, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by Ulalia from SPBD.  Ulalia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Vavau.  She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Lina owns and operates a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Lina has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, Lina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1600 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment and tools in order to expand the business.  Lina is now requesting a new loan of 2300 WST which will be used to invest in renovating the business.  The loan will be her fourth loan from SPBD.  Lina plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is married with four school-aged children.  To make a living, Lona operates a family member's business raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Lona has been doing this for over six years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Lona joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lona is now requesting a new loan of 2200 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her sixth loan from SPBD.  Lona plans to use the additional revenue generated to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

F. is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Tafitoala.  She is married with five adult children.  Fuaselela owns and operates a bakery.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from baking and selling cakes to the local community.  Fuaselela has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 850 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Fuaselela joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fuaselela has successfully repaid a previous loan, to purchase additional cooking ingredients, of 2250 WST from SPBD.  Fuaselela is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fifth loan from SPBD.  Fuaselela plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 37-year-old woman living in the town of Tafitoala.  She is married with five school-aged children.  Siloma owns and operates a business venture raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Siloma has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Siloma joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Siloma has successfully repaid a previous loan, to purchase fertilizers such as manure, of 1750 WST from SPBD.  Siloma is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fifth loan from SPBD.  Siloma plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Levi Saleimoa.  She is married with 12 school-aged children.   Gloria owns and operates a business raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Gloria has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Gloria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  Gloria is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fourth loan from Kiva partner SPBD.  Gloria plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

F. (0) is a 33 year-old woman living in the town of Mulivai Leauvaa.  She is married and has 3 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Savalia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Savalia has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Savalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Savalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  Savalia is now requesting a new loan of 1,200 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by her from SPBD.  Savalia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

John is an individual client of Pearl Microfinance in Jinja. He is 54 years old and married with nine children of which four are in school. He cares for six orphaned children of his late brother. John has been involved in the business of casting and melting metals for 10 years and before then he started by working in factories where he got the experience and started working alone. He makes spare parts like gears for factories in Jinja and Kampala and he is able to make a monthly profit of 2 million shillings. His quality products make his customers come to him as well as being trust worthy. His business goal is to expand further so that he can have access to more scrap and chemicals so that he can earn more and open up another branch. He has benefited by building his own home and now works from his home, hence not renting anymore.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of products like vegetables, spices, etc., in the local community. Madjiar has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Madjiar joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Madjiar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to  purchase new items to expand product offering. Madjiar is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Madjiar from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Mrs. Sinuon U. is the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice for a living. Her husband, Mr. Suong Veasna, is a fisherman. In these two businesses, Mrs. Sinuon U. faces problems because her rice field is infertile soil so it has affected her crop. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy more fertilizers to support the field to make her crop more productive. She will use the rest of her loan to buy a boat for her husband's business. Mrs. Sinuon U. is 30 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom are attending the local school while the other is only 3 years old so is still too young to work or study. All the group loan members are presented in the picture but most of them are blocked.\r\n\r\nSeventeen members in this group loan are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

Rauf, 44, is married with two children and lives in Isfara, Tajikistan. For the past 15 years, Rauf has been earning money by processing apricots and selling them at the market. Because he wishes to buy more dried apricots so he can earn more and improve his living, Rauf is requesting a loan of $1200 to expand his operation.  He says that this is the perfect time for him to take out a loan.  By offering a better selection, he will be able to capitalize on this opportunity. His goal is to continue expanding and improving his business every day, and more importantly, to ensure that his children will always be able to attend a good school. Rauf is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She was married for over 20 years, but her husband abandoned her.  She now lives alone.  Her two children got a loan to be able to buy soldering equipment and be able to work.  Delfina lives in the Maica Sud community in Cochabamba.  She has three cows.  She uses their milk to make cheese and sell it at different markets in the city of Cochabamba and to people who sell \u201cCharque\u201d (a traditional dish eaten with cheese in Cochabamba).  Delfina has been making cheese for over 32 years.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy food for her livestock (corn husks).  Due to drought problems, the cost has increased a great deal.  She does not have enough to buy all of the food that the cows need.  This way they will not have trouble producing the same quantity of milk that they now produce.  Also, the quantity and quality of cheese will not be reduced.  Delfina hopes to be able to get another loan once this one is finalized to be able to buy more cows and increase her milk production and increase her income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":367436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy food for her milking cows (corn husks)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2009-08-10T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T14:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87020801,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T17:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96933724,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103774799,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110663763,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118059638,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123894903,"comment":null},{"amount":249.98,"local_amount":249.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":249.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128928862,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-10T20:13:55Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:40:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128057,"name":"God Thank You Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Finda is a mother of five children and has never been to school.

Houenafa is married to Felix Zoungni, the head of the Zogbo district in Cotonou. She is the mother of six children of whom two are deceased and only two are currently enrolled in school. Three years ago Houenafa began selling food. She sold fried rice to private school children not far from the Zogbo district. To this business she added the sale of donuts made of wheat flour. She has also added the sale of corn noodles, locally known as akassa, accompanied with fried fish to her business. Houenafa has already benefited from four loans from ALIDe; these loans have been fully repaid and were used to help her develop the business described above. Houenafa is asking for her fifth loan in an effort to grow this business and better satisfy her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Mark Translator, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":367484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of four 50Kg bags of rice, four 25 liter drums of vegetable oil, and three 100Kg bags of corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-08-10T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Houenafa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549956,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983747,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896116,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735696,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623207,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019912,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858406,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":18470.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618560,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36941.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652639,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

","en":"Carmen, 42, lives with her mother and her two children in her own house.  She is a teacher.  For 20 years she has also worked in agriculture.  She plants products that are native to her region.  She then sells them in the primary market in her area.  She also separates part for her own consumption.\r\n\r\nThe work she does intensifies according to the season.  In planting season she needs to prepare and fertilize the land.  In the harvest she stocks up on, in this case, corn.

She also sells in the markets in neighboring towns, and has dedicated customers who work at an institution, and for whom she restocks her cheeses two times a week. Her primary supplier is one of her neighbors, who produces cheese and distributes it wholesale. This way, Felipa can sell as much as 200 kilos of fresh cheese each week, and during holiday times she earns much more, for example, during the recent national celebrations.\r\nIn the near future, Felipa would like to sell other products, and have her own space in the market. \r\nThis is her first loan from MFP. For her, working with this type of credit is a new experience, and she has promised to make her payments on time. The funds she is requesting will be invested in purchasing more cheese, as well as other foods she will begin to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristen Beck, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":367526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-10T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.8},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":79.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":82.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":85.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.8},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.8,"local_amount":66.12,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":73.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641708,"comment":null},{"amount":25.21,"local_amount":67.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081150,"comment":null},{"amount":26.49,"local_amount":70.64,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":78.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997300,"comment":null},{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":72.4,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842645,"comment":null},{"amount":121.35,"local_amount":323.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":361.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734220,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

A. K. is a 43-year-old woman living in the town of Fagalii-Uta.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Faete runs a general store.  The primary source of income for this business comes selling a variety of different products to the local community.  Faete has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\r\n\r\nFaete joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Faete has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 Samoan tala (or about $725 US) from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to renovate her general store.  Faete is now requesting a new loan of 2500 tala (or about $950) which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan Faete has taken out from SPBD.  Faete plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her store.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is a 54-year-old woman living in the town of Nuusuatia.  She is married and has 8 adult-aged children.  To make a living, Akenese raises crops.  Income for this business comes primarily from planting, harvesting, and selling breadfruit.  Akenese has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 300 Samoan tala (or about $125 US) from these activities.\r\n\r\nAkenese joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve both her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Akenese has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1700 tala (or about $700) from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Akenese is now requesting a new loan of 2400 tala (or about $925) which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops.  The loan will be Akenese's 4th loan from SPBD.  Akenese plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
