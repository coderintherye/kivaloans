is married and he is the father of four children.  He is a hardworking and honest man.  For the last 13 years Ibodullo has been selling woman\u2019s fabrics in several local markets, \u201cChorku\u201d, \u201cVorukh\u201d and \u201cSurkh\u201d where there is great demand.  His wife is also engaged in this business and she sells fabrics at home because women in this village are not allowed to run a market business. \r\n\r\nWith this business he receives a good profit and he wishes to keep his money for building a home and buying wheat.  His son who is 13 years old is also engaged in their family business.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To allow his customers to spend their time smoothly and happily, Mohamad Ramzi has a small snack stand in his shop where he sells chips, soft drinks, and sweets. He has requested a loan from A. Majmoua to buy a juicer that will help introduce fresh juice to customers, and to increase his inventory of tobacco and sweets. Mohamad Ramzi enjoys being at work because he likes to watch his customers enjoy spending their time at his place. He hopes he can upgrade his machines in the future and expand his shop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":996,"image":{"id":816481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a juicer, tobacco, and a sweets for his Internet cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Marjeyoun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamad Ramzi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249,"local_amount":249,"processed_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":249,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973136,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T07:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731250,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534783,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-24T08:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494309,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702409,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T08:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299349,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317398,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T17:19:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":318281,"name":"Binti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Binti, a married woman with two children, all of whom attend school, owns a house that has electricity but no piped water.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":581.21,"image":{"id":816570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle in order to increase the number of his herd and expand his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ikromiddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":349.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":360.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":375.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":371.23},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":408.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":407.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":417.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":439.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":446.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":458.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":476.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":489.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.77},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159.83,"local_amount":743.4,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":750.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227339758,"comment":null},{"amount":75.63,"local_amount":351.76,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":355,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238643506,"comment":null},{"amount":85.07,"local_amount":395.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":399.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244597944,"comment":null},{"amount":82.92,"local_amount":385.69,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":389.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811950,"comment":null},{"amount":88.43,"local_amount":411.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":415.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257220637,"comment":null},{"amount":89.33,"local_amount":415.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":419.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580588,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T12:19:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":318326,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph has been a farmer in the Muranga area of central Kenya for over 25 years.

She and her employees aim at offering the best of service to not only their usual clients but also new clients. This has endeared them to many people, most especially women.\r\n\r\nNot everything has been going well, however. She says the rising cost of doing business in most of East Africa has not spared her business. She says most of the cosmetics and other equipment she uses at her salon are increasingly becoming expensive. As a result, her business's growth has been stifled somewhat.\r\n\r\nShe remains upbeat, hoping for a favorable turn in circumstances soon. For a woman who was previously a housewife, this progress and attitude in the face of business adversity is encouraging. This mother of three says this business's gross profits total up to 500,000 Ugandan shillings weekly.

She will use it to buy new lines of cosmetics and larger amounts of women\u2019s clothing because by paying cash and buying wholesale she saves and becomes more competitive in the marketplace.  While Shakira works toward attaining her dreams, she manages a profit margin of no less than 28% and an 18-day lag in accounts receivable.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":317.77,"image":{"id":816830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy new brands of cosmetics and women's clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shakira Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72354},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76296},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77758},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":79249},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80768},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82316},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83894},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85502},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87140},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88810},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90513},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.6},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.6,"local_amount":72354,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":72598.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320504,"comment":null},{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":76296,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":76553.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803625,"comment":null},{"amount":44.71,"local_amount":77758,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":78020.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614708,"comment":null},{"amount":45.57,"local_amount":79249,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79516.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568660,"comment":null},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":80768,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":81040.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779998,"comment":null},{"amount":47.34,"local_amount":82316,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":82593.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188391,"comment":null},{"amount":48.24,"local_amount":83894,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":84177.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324616,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T20:34:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":318435,"name":"Las Palomas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco comunal Las Palomas est\u00e1 conformado por Juana, Tomasa, Leseyda, Oscar Danilo, Ad\u00e1n Emilio, Blanca, Emiliana, Marcia, Maria y Sonia.

Its members are Victoria, who will use the loan to buy corn and corn husks to make tamales, Aleja and Edna who will buy seasonal fruit like avocadoes, pomegranates and peaches, Minerva who will buy piglets to fatten up and Luisa who will buy flour, sugar and yeast.\r\n\r\nLuisa is 55 years old.  She completed second grade.  She\u2019s married and has 9 children, all married and independent.  She sells bread and is asking for the loan to buy flour, sugar, shortening, firewood, eggs, butter and yeast.  She offers her customers sweet bread, \u201cteleras\u201d (rolls used to make tortas) and \u201cbolillos\u201d (French rolls).\r\n\r\nShe started her business 30 years ago because of need and poverty.  She already had little children and her mother-in-law taught her how to make bread.  She used to help her make it and she stared little by little to make bread and gradually grew.  Now, she sells more.  With money earned by her husband working in the fields she bought raw materials to start the business.  Now her husband and son help her make the bread and she goes to downtown Jumiltepec to set up her sales stand to sell it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because she gets income to cover needs and for food.  She is proud because she has many customers that buy her bread because they like the flavor of the bread they make with such joy.\r\n\r\nThe challenges she faces are the high price of ingredients.  She uses profits from the business for food, to pay back the loan and part as savings.  \r\n\r\nShe is happy with the loan that she\u2019ll get that she\u2019ll use to buy ingredients to make bread.  It will strengthen her business.  Her dreams and hopes are to stay in business making and selling bread and that her children have everything good that life has to offer.\r\n\r\nJumiltepec is a pretty town with mild temperature.  There is a lot of vegetation.  Fruits like avocadoes, peaches, pears, vines, \u2018capulines\u2019 (similar to sour cherries) abound.  Residents celebrate February 2 as \u201cOur Lady of Candlemas\u201d day.  Food is prepared for all the pilgrims who climb the hill where the Virgin of Candlemas chapel es located.

Her community has a lot of land, but not so many inhabitants.  The people in this community are more prepared in comparison to other places.  For example, the majority of the children are studying, preparing, and going to school.  Also, it is a place that preserves many of their customs from a simple greeting to festivities in the same town.\r\n\r\nMarisol has lived here her whole life.  She currently devotes herself to making handicrafts, making napkins, embroideries, and sweaters that she sells.  She has many years of experience making handicrafts.  She has been selling her napkins for two years.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to be able to buy material.  In this case she wishes to buy thread.  She is looking for a specific good quality brand in order to be able to make her needlework finer and of a better quality.  She faces various challenges.  \r\n\r\nShe says that one of the primary ones is having to leave her needlework with her customers on a payment plan.  Later, when she collects, she runs the risk that she will not be paid.  She also mentions that there are brands of thread that are not easy to find.  This makes her have to leave her town and look in the city for what she cannot find.  If she embroiders with everyday thread her work is a bit thick, and that looks ugly.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help Marisol to be able to buy material in volume.  This way is, as they say, cheaper by the dozen.  It will help her have more income, which is what she is seeking.  It will also help her fulfill one of her goals, which is to have a place to sell her handicrafts.  Then she will show the people what she knows how to do and what she makes.\r\n\r\nMarisol is 28 years old, and she has been married for nine years.  She has three young children.  One is a baby, and the two others are in school.  Her husband works for a pharmacy, and they live in their own house.\r\n\r\nMarisol\u2019s group is comprised of seven women.  Like her, they know how to make napkins and embroideries.  The seven women are called \u201cMujeres con Futuro\u201d (Women with a Future).  They have been working with the institution for three cycles.  Their name means that they are going to improve in their businesses.  That is why they named the group this way.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of the women in this group are as follows:\r\n\r\n2.-Veronica:  Sells shoes by catalog\r\n3.-Gilberta:  Makes tableclothes for tables or decorations.\r\n4.-Karina:  Has a grocery store and will use the loan to buy merchandise \r\n5.-Natalia:  Sells cosmetics by catalog and plans to invest the same way\r\n6.-Maridalia:  Sells new clothes\r\n\r\nThis is the Mujeres con Futuro group.  The seven members are from the San Pablo Tlachichilpa community.  They are neighbors, and they have known each other for several years.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":812326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy brand name thread for needlework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T22:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maridalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3383.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223537,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6766.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201826,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6766.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807417,"comment":null},{"amount":575,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6766.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618512,"comment":null},{"amount":287.5,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3383.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-22T13:26:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":318481,"name":"Primitivo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Primitivo es agricultor,  casado con la se\u00f1ora Eloida la cual se dedica a labores del hogar, Tienen  5 hijos que se encuentran en edad escolar, el Sr. Primitivo naci\u00f3 en Potos\u00ed, hoy vive en Limones a 25 km del Torno se vino a Santa Cruz a buscar mejores condiciones de vida, donde trabaja juntamente con su familia siembran ma\u00edz, arroz, yuca y tambi\u00e9n se dedica a sacar madera para las carpinter\u00edas,  Es con la \u00fanica entidad financiera que el trabaja ya que es la que le da apoyo financiero, el destino del cr\u00e9dito es para preparar el terreno y sembrar arroz, es una persona trabajadora agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por el apoyo brindado.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"Se\u00f1or Primitivo is a farmer.

They named themselves after the street where they live. One representative of the group is named Francisca Graciela. She completed primary school and has four children. Graciela sells clothing from a catalogue and requires a loan to buy more. Besides selling clothing, she also wants to sell shoes. \r\n\r\nGraciela's customers want her to open a storefront. When she is out picking up orders and visiting customers, she leaves things in the hands of her granddaughter, who can't place orders. She also wants  a storefront so that she can create displays of her merchandise and encourage her customers to buy a bit more. Graciela wants a loan so that she can improve her business, earn more money, buy more merchandise, and present a better variety of clothing to her customers. \r\n\r\nAnother member of Tututepec Las Gardenias is Bertha. She completed primary school and has two children: a girl and a boy. She sells perfume and shoes via catalogue, and needs a loan so that she can buy more perfume; it's the most popular thing she sells. Her customers have suggested she set up a storefront so that they can visit her, see her products, and buy them without placing orders. \r\n\r\nBertha wants a loan so that she can put up a storefront. It will help her perfumes and shoes sell better. She would also like to set up a gift shop in the busiest shopping district in Tututepec.\r\n\r\nTututepec Las Gardenias includes several other members. Alejandra and Soledad each sell cheese. Sandra sells tamales. Reyna sells stationery. Zuli and Carmina each sell corn chips. Maria sells Mexican snacks and treats, and Cristiano sells groceries.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the Fundacion Realidad for the support, which will help this group make their businesses successful.

Her spouse gave her money to buy supplies and start up the business selling tacos on Saturdays and Sundays.  She is happy with the loan she got, because she will buy supplies needed to prepare tacos and keep her customers happy.  Her business matters, because it helps her financially.  She is happy when people are satisfied with the service provided.  She feels proud when they tell her that her tacos are tasty, and they come back for more tacos.  She uses the earnings to invest in supplies, and gradually is expanding her business, for things that her son needs in school, and things needed at home.  \n\nShe hopes to build a house on a piece of land she has in Jaloxtoc, and for her business to continue to grow, in order to provide a better life for her children, and for them to have what they need. \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":813280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"buy meat, produce, nopal (type of cactus), and bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavia Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lazaro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":787.5,"local_amount":9187.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9267.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201829,"comment":null},{"amount":539.26,"local_amount":6291.42,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807420,"comment":null},{"amount":414.23,"local_amount":4832.64,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4874.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618515,"comment":null},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":688.44,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":694.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573418,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T10:27:01Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":318520,"name":"Olga Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La falta de oportunidades para conseguir empleo despu\u00e9s de quedar desempleada y la necesidad de generar ingresos propios, hicieron que Olga emprendiera su propio negocio.

She is an entrepreneur living in Ivano-Frankivsk. She works as a vendor at the main industrial market \u201cTraian.\u201d After finishing technical college, Svitlana decided against accepting a low-paying job and started working as a marketplace vendor instead. After having worked for three years as an employee, she decided to launch her own business, which she is still running at present. She sells various accessories such as belts, handbags, caps, blazers, slippers etc. Her stall is well known with customers thanks to her low prices on a wide variety of goods. Svitlana has been doing this line of work for eight years. Her monthly income is 5,000 Hryvnias (UAH). She is requesting a loan of 10,000 UAH. She plans to stock up on belts (250 pcs) and handbags (15 pcs) for retail. She would like to get ready for August and replenish her selection of goods oriented toward young people. Svitlana\u2019s business is the main source of income for her family. She does not get discouraged, even though she had to give up one of her stalls due to   financial crisis. At least she  has managed to preserve her business, and now she continues to grow it further. Svitlana would like to use her anticipated earnings to pay for repairs in the apartment where her whole family lives. Note: this loan description is provided in Russian.

origen Mazahua,la comunidad es grande y esta en las faldas de un monte, para llegar al lugar hay que caminar mucho, aunque si hay una carretera en buen estado no pasa el servicio de taxi o de camion, la gente platica que es muy normal para ellos caminar mucho para salir o entrar a su comunidad, ya se acostumbraron y tampoco se les hace retirado el camino, la actividad economica de la comunidad es la agricultura \u00f3 comercio ya que crian animales como borregos, puercos, pollos y guajolotes para poderlos vender, es manera de poder tener ingresos extras mas que nada de las se\u00f1oras ya que los hombres salen a trabajar y muchos de ellos se van a la ciudad de M\u00e9xico en busca de un trabajo, En el grupo de la carrera se encuentra la representante y ella nos platica sobre su negocio, la se\u00f1ora se llama Victoria y su negocio es vender verduras, vende calabaza, zanahorias, flor de calabaza, nopales, chayotes, cilantro, cebolla etc; la se\u00f1ora tiene poco mas de 4 a\u00f1os que se animo a vender verdura en su comunidad, no tiene un lugar estable en el que pueda estar vendiendo, lo que hace es andar caminando casa por casa para ofrecer su mercancia, y se le dificulta mucho la caminada y andar cargando la verdura, tambien que le calcula en el peso para poder dar los kilos, pero muchas veces la gente siempre le pide mas porque dice que le falta para completar el kilo, son estas las cosas que en ocasiones desaniman a la se\u00f1ora de seguir con el negocio, la se\u00f1ora Victoria piensa invertir el crdito en comprar mas verdura para salir a vender y tener un poco mas de ganancias y tambien utilizar las cosas que no se vendan para que ella pueda hacer su comida en casa, le gustaria mucho a la se\u00f1ora tener un local propio para vender varias cosas y hacer una tienda grande dejar de caminar y estar en su casa con su negocio, do\u00f1a Victoria tiene 3 hijos que van a la escuela, tiene 37 a\u00f1os y 14 a\u00f1os de casada, vive con su familia en casa propia y su esposo trabaja en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico.El resto de los integrantes se llaman;\n1.-Maria Angela, ella cria y venta de borregos y pollos\n2.-Maria Bonifacia hace bordados y

que esta muy cerca de la de ellos y les gusta mucho ese nombre, es la raz\u00f3n por la que desidieron ponerle este nombre a su grupo\n","en":"The \u201cLa Carrera\u201d group is located in the community of Dotegiare, San Felipe del Progreso, a community that\u2019s totally Mazahua.  The community is large and located on the skirts of a mountain.  To get to it one must travel quite a bit.  Although there is a highway in good condition there is no taxi or bus service.  People relate that it\u2019s quite normal for them to walk quite a bit to get into or to leave their community.  However, they are now used to this and the road doesn\u2019t even seem very long to them anymore.\n\nThe community\u2019s economic activity is farming or commerce since they raise such animals as lambs, pigs, chickens and turkeys to sell.  This is a way of earning extra income more for the women than the men because the men to out to work and many of them go to M\u00e9xico City to look for work.\n\nThe La Carrera group has a representative, Victoria, who tells us about her business.  Her business is selling vegetables.  She sells squash, carrots, squash blossoms, cactus paddles, chayote, cilantro, onions, etc.  It\u2019s been a little more than four years now that she ventured to sell vegetables in her community.  She does not have a fixed location to sell so she does it going house to house to offer her merchandise.  It\u2019s quite difficult for her to walk so much carrying her vegetables.  She also has to calculate the weight to sell by the kilo and often people insist on more because they claim the kilo is short.  These are the things that sometimes discourage her to continue with the business.\n\nVictoria plans to use the loan to buy more vegetables to go out to sell and have a bit more profits and she uses the items she doesn\u2019t sell to prepare her meals at home.  She\u2019d very much like to have a locale of her own to sell several things and to have a large store in order to not have to be wandering about anymore and be able to stay at home with her business.\n\nVictoria has three children going to school.  She\u2019s 37 years old and has been married 14 years.  She lives wither family in her own house and her husband works in M\u00e9xico City.\n\nThe rest of the group members are: \n\n1.-Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela, she raises sheep and chickens to sell\n2.-Mar\u00eda Bonifacia, she makes napkins and embroiders\n3.-Fidelina, she has a grocery store\n4.-Alejandra, makes napkins, sews and also knows how to embroider\n5.-Julia, raises and sells sheep\n6.-Ernestina, raises chickens and turkeys\n7.-Noe, raises sheep to sell\n8.-Mar\u00eda, knows how to embroider and sells tablecloths\n9.-Abel, has a grocery store in his community\n\nThere are 10 members in the La Carrera group and they named it that way after a community that\u2019s very near them and they like the name very much; that\u2019s why they decided to name their group that.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":816696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to sell fruit

The members gave the group this name because the place where the group meets is in a cabin belonging to one of the members.  \r\n\r\nBlanca is 36 years old and married to Faustino.  They have three children: a young girl of 17 who is in senior high school and two younger children who are in high school.  Blanca's business is a bakery which supplies several businesses in her community.  She also goes out to sell her products with her children in their neighborhood in the afternoons.  She has owned this business for approximately ten years.  She tells us that her husband's family taught her how to make the different types and flavors of bread such as 'conchas de chocolate' (\"chocolate shells\" - chocolate flavored bread that is often dipped in hot drinks), 'cuernitos' (\"little horns\" - croissants), 'borrachitos' (\"little drunken ones\" - a sweet treat soaked with alcohol), 'espejos' (\"mirrors\" - large, glazed cookies), 'hojaldras' (dough fritters), etc.  She says that she starts making her bread very early in the morning, at 4.00am, so that she can get it out of the oven and start selling it very early.  In the afternoon she makes another batch at 4.00pm to sell in the evening.\r\n\r\nBlanca is requesting a loan from our financial institution to buy flour, vegetable shortening, eggs, milk, sugar, salt, etc.  She tells us that, thanks to the loans that she has received, her business has gradually improved as she didn't used to make much bread owing to a lack of ingredients.  Now she and her husband go out and sell their products in other towns in a small van.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are Consuelo, Leticia, Mar\u00eda del Rosario, Florentina, Maribel, Tomasa, Marisela, Martha, Isabel, Liliana, Reynalda, Sof\u00eda and Gabriela.
