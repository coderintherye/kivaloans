Francisco","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Ernesto is 55 years old and was born in the province of Gaza.  He was trained to be an elementary school teacher.  He is married and the father of 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys, all are adults (the oldest is 32 years old and the youngest is 22).  The first two are already employed, and the other 2 are studying at the university but are still his responsibility.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto and his family moved from the province of Gaza to Namaacha in 1986 due to a job transfer so he could work as a professor in the teacher-training school located in Namaacha.  Since then Ernesto and his family have lived there and he works in the same school.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has a monthly salary of 7,400MTn and works from 7:30am to 10:00pm with a 2-hour lunch break.  Besides 2 of his children, Ernesto supports two nephews in the Chibuto province of Gaza sending them 1,500MTn monthly.  Still he is able to save approximately 2,500MTn per month with the help of receipts from a small stand he possesses.<p>\r\n\r\nIt has been 10 years since Ernesto began his selling activities in a small stand (store) in response to the increase in the cost of living.  His activities consist of selling a variety of drinks and basic staple products.  The best seller is a national beer with a 2M mark that is acquired for 200MTn per box and sold for 300MTn.  The monthly receipts vary between 2,000MTn and 3,000MTn depending on the time of year (winter or summer, respectively).<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has his own home.  This is his second loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva.  The first loan for 20,000MTn was used to purchase construction materials to build a coop to raise chickens, a business that still isn't up and running.  Ernesto paid that loan off early and without difficulties.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan Ernesto intends to purchase products for his stand, increasing his stocks as well as his sales.  In the future Ernesto would like to purchase baby chicks to begin his poultry business now that the coop is almost finished.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nErnesto tem 55 anos de idade e nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Gaza. Ernesto fez a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de professor prim\u00e1rio, \u00e9 casado e pai de 4 filhos, sendo duas meninas e dois rapazes, todos j\u00e1 maiores de idade (o primeiro filho tem 32 anos de idade e o ultimo 22 anos). Os dois primeiros j\u00e1 est\u00e3o empregados e os dois \u00faltimos estudam na universidade sob sua responsabilidade.\r\n\r\nErnesto e sua fam\u00edlia mudaram-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Namaacha em 1986 devido a transfer\u00eancia que ele teve para ir trabalhar na escola de forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos professores situado em Namaacha como professor. Desde ent\u00e3o Ernesto e sua fam\u00edlia l\u00e1 vivem, Ernesto ainda trabalhando na mesma escola. Ernesto tem um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 7,400, trabalhando das 7:30h as 22:00h com intervalo de 2 horas de almo\u00e7o. \r\n\r\nErnesto para alem dos dois filhos  sustenta mais dois sobrinhos que se encontram em Chibuto prov\u00edncia de Gaza, enviando mensalmente MTn 1,500. Ainda assim consegue poupar do sal\u00e1rio aproximadamente MTn 2,500 com ajuda das receitas da pequena barraca que possui.\r\n\r\nH\u00e1 dez anos Ernesto iniciou a atividade de venda em uma pequena barraca (loja) como resposta a subida do custo de vida. A atividade consiste na venda de variedades de bebidas e produtos de necessidade b\u00e1sica, onde destaca com mais sa\u00edda a cerveja nacional de marca 2M que \u00e9 adquirida por MTn 200 a caixa e vendida por MTn 300. A receita liquida mensal varia entre MTn 2,000 a MTn 3,000, dependendo do per\u00edodo do ano (inverno ou ver\u00e3o, respectivamente).\r\n\r\nErnesto tem casa pr\u00f3pria. Este \u00e9 o seu segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 20,000 foi usado para compra de material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para construir uma capoeira para cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos, negocio ainda n\u00e3o iniciado. Ernesto pagou este empr\u00e9stimo sem dificuldades antes do tempo.\r\n\r\nCom este empr\u00e9stimo Ernesto pretende comprar produtos para sua barraca, aumentando assim o estoque e as vendas. No futuro Ernesto gostaria de comprar pintos para iniciar sua atividade av\u00edcola, j\u00e1 que esta quase conclu\u00edda a capoeira."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":169964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Lucinda married her husband after her first fiance went to South Africa and never returned.  She lives in her own home with her husband, two step sons, and one nephew, and her daughter is in Maputo.<p>\r\n\r\nLucinda is a native of the province of Gaza and moved to Namaacha with her husband when he was transferred with his work.  Because it is a mountainous region and on the border with Swaziland they decided to stay permanently in this area.  Lucinda studied through the 4th grade and stopped due to the difficult financial condition of her family.<p>\r\n\r\nShe has been a trader for many years having decided to start a business to help her husband with the household expenses.  She has a stand in the front yard of her home and works from 7:00am until 7:00pm.  The products with the most sell-through are the basic necessities like rice, peanuts, beans, and corn flour.<p>\r\n\r\nLucinda has a monthly income of approximately 2,000MTn.  Through a neighbor who is already a client, Lucinda discovered Hluvuku.  As her money for moving stock was low, she contacted Hluvuku to solicit this loan for 25,000MTn with which she will grow the volume of her business.   The primary objectives are to improve her business and enlarge her stand.  In the future Lucinda would like to see her daughter and her step sons enrolled in college, and she would like to expand her home to make her family more comfortable.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLucinda tem 41 anos de idade, \u00e9 casada e m\u00e3e  de uma filha de 25 anos de idade que freq\u00fcenta um curso de enfermagem na capital Maputo. Lucinda se casou com o atual marido depois que seu primeiro noivo foi para a \u00c1frica do Sul e nunca mais retornou. Lucinda vive em sua pr\u00f3pria casa com o marido, dois enteados e um sobrinho, dado que sua filha mora em Maputo.\r\n\r\nLucinda \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de Gaza, e mudou-se para Namaacha com o marido, que foi transferido no trabalho. Por ser uma regi\u00e3o montanhosa e na fronteira com a Swazilandia, decidiram fixar-se definitivamente nesta zona. Lucinda estudou somente ate a 4a classe e parou devido a dif\u00edcil condi\u00e7\u00e3o financeira de sua fam\u00edlia. \r\n\r\nLucinda \u00e9 comerciante faz muitos anos, decidiu abrir um negocio para ajudar o marido com as despesas de casa. Ela tem uma barraca no quintal em frente a sua casa e trabalha das 7:00 horas as 19:00 horas. Os produtos com mais sa\u00edda s\u00e3o os de necessidade b\u00e1sica, como arroz, amendoim, feij\u00e3o e farinha de milho. Lucinda tem um lucro mensal de aproximadamente MTn 2,000. \r\n\r\nAtrav\u00e9s de uma vizinha que j\u00e1 \u00e9 cliente, Lucinda soube da exist\u00eancia da Hluvuku. Como o dinheiro para a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do estoque era baixo, contatou a Hluvuku para solicitar este empr\u00e9stimo no valor de MTn 25,000 com qual vai aumentar o volume do seu negocio.\r\n\r\nOs objetivos prim\u00e1rios de Lucinda s\u00e3o melhorar o seu negocio e ampliar a sua barraca. No futuro Lucinda gostaria de ver sua filha e seus enteados formados na faculdade e tamb\u00e9m gostaria de ampliar a sua casa para dar mais conforto a sua

His daughter is not in school because the school she would be able to attend is very far from home.\r\n\r\n<p>Wiliamo went to school until the 10th grade and abandoned his studies to search for work so he could care for his family, principally for his brothers since he lost his father very early and his mother has been without work for a long time.

Wiliamo has a monthly income of approximately 2,000MTn and is able to save between 300MTn and 500MTn per month.  This will be the second loan that Wiliamo has with Hluvuku, however it is the first with Kiva. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the first loan he purchased materials to assist with the excavation of stone.  With this loan of 10,000MTn he intends to restock his store with products thus increasing his sales and his income.

He is married and the father of 5 children, 2 girls and 3 boys.  The oldest is a 15 year old girl and the youngest is 2.  The first four are already in school.  His parents also live with him in his house.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1984 Xavier moved to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, because his father was transferred with his job.  Xavier attended school until the 11th grade, and afterwards completed a course for assistant customs officer that lasted only 6 months.  He worked in customs as a first category assistant customs officer and earned a monthly salary of 3,500MTn working from 7am to 8pm except on weekends.<p>\r\n\r\nSince his salary was not sufficient to sustain his family, Xavier decided to open a stand off his house where he could sell various products.  Ones that stand out are rice that he buys for 14MTn and sells for 17.5MTn and drinks (beer that he buys for 21MTn and sells for 25MTn, and wine that he buys for 50MTn and sells for 85MTn.)<p>\r\n\r\nXavier has a monthly income of approximately 2,500MTn and he saves a maximum of 1,000MTn.  This is the second loan that he has taken from Hluvuku and the first from Kiva.  The first was for 15,000MTn and was used to begin his selling activities.  Xavier was able to pay it off early and returned to solicit this loan that will also to be used for growing his inventory and increasing his sales. <p>\r\n\r\nHe has a dream to continue with his studies and in the first phase conclude with the middle level.  Only with a higher level can he climb in his career and one day become a customs delegate.<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nXavier tem 33  anos de idade e nasceu na vila da Matola (Prov\u00edncia de Maputo). Xavier \u00e9 casado e pai de 5 filhos, sendo duas meninas e tr\u00eas rapazes. A maior \u00e9 uma menina de 15 anos e o mais novo tem 2 anos. Os quatros primeiros j\u00e1 v\u00e3o a escola. Em sua casa vivem tamb\u00e9m os seus pais.\r\n\r\nEm 1984 Xavier mudou-se para Namaacha, uma vila na fronteira com a Swazilandia porque seu pai foi transferido no trabalho. Xavier estudou ate a 11a  classe, e depois fez um curso de auxiliar aduaneiro nas alf\u00e2ndegas que durou apenas 6 meses. Xavier trabalha nas alf\u00e2ndegas como auxiliar aduaneiro de primeira categoria e aufere um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 3,500, trabalhando das 7:00h as 20:00h excepto nos finais de semana.\r\n\r\nComo o sal\u00e1rio n\u00e3o era suficiente para sustentar sua fam\u00edlia, Xavier decidiu abrir uma barra no recinto da casa onde vende produtos diversos da primeira necessidade. Destaca-se o  arroz ngonhama que compra por MTn 14 e vende por MTn 17.50 e as bebidas (cervejas, que compra por MTn 21 e vende por MTn 25, e vinhos, que compra por MTn 50 e vende por MTn 85). Xavier tem um rendimento liquido mensal de aproximadamente MTn 2,500 e poupa deste no m\u00e1ximo MTn 1,000.\r\n\r\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo de Xavier na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro foi de MTn 15,000 e foi usado para iniciar as atividades de vendas. Xavier conseguiu pagar antes do tempo e voltou a solicitar este que tamb\u00e9m destina o para ampliar o estoque e aumentar suas vendas.\r\n\r\nTem como sonho continuar com os estudos e numa primeira fase concluir o n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio. Somente com n\u00edvel superior Xavier poder\u00e1 subir em sua carreira e um dia se tornar delegado alfandeg\u00e1rio."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":169976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Currently, he lives in Namaacha, a village in the province of Maputo which borders Swaziland. Enosse is married and is the father of 2 children -- both are students, the oldest is 13 years old and the youngest is 10 years old. \r\n\r\nEnosse lives in his own home with his wife, children, a cousin and a nephew.  In 1987, he left the province of Inhambe for Maputo to look for work. There, he worked for a company that closed down after two years. Six months later another investor decided to reopen the company and rehired some of the previous employees including Enosse. He took the job because at that time he still had not found employment anywhere else. This business also failed after three years but this time the employees received a severance reward payment. With this reward money Enosse purchased a vehicle and started a chicken raising business. For four years Enosse would raise the chickls for 21 days and then sell them to slaughter houses. However, with the increase in the price of the feed, he decided to let go of that venture and keep his passengers transportation business only, which he achieved by using the vehicle he bought with severance reward. In 2004, he went back into the chicken raising business since prices were once again affordable. Nowadays, Enosse raises at least 400 chicks at a time. According to him the best results come from selling the chicken already slaughtered. He has been selling about 150 chickens every month to the Financial Department of the Namaacha District. The sale of live chickens is also lucrative. Enosse has generated a monthly income between MTN 3,000 and MTn 4,000 but he has not been able to save much due to high family expenses. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan Enosse requests from Hluvuku and his fisrt through Kiva. With the first loan of MTn 7,000, Enosse purchased chicks and improved his business. This time, Enosse wants to apply the MTN 10,000 to purchase more chicks so that he can increase his flock and, therefore, profits. He will also fix the fencing which is old and need repairs.\r\n\r\nIn the future Enosse wants to increase his chicken raising ability, purchase additional hens and buy a new vehicle to help transport and sell the chickens. His biggest dream, however, is to see his children graduate from college. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nEnosse tem 41 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de  Inhambane. Atualmente reside em Namaacha, uma vila na prov\u00edncia de Maputo que faz fronteira com a Swazilandia. Enosse \u00e9 casado e pai de 2 filhos, ambos estudantes sendo o maior com 13 anos e ca\u00e7ula com 10 anos de idade.\r\n\r\nEnosse vive na pr\u00f3pria casa juntos com a sua esposa, seus filhos, um primo e uma sobrinha. Em 1987 saiu da prov\u00edncia de Inhambane para Maputo a procura de emprego onde come\u00e7a a trabalhar numa empresa que dois anos depois faliu. Assim seis meses depois houve outro empres\u00e1rio que decide abrir e chamar os antigos trabalhadores e ele foi um deles, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o tinha arranjado ainda outro emprego. Este negocio tamb\u00e9m fechou 3 anos depois, mas desta vez indenizou os trabalhadores. Com o valor desta indeniza\u00e7\u00e3o Enosse comprou uma viatura e come\u00e7ou tamb\u00e9m com o negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos de corte. Por quatro anos Enosse criava os frangos por 21 dias e vendia para outros criadores fazerem o abate. Porem, com a r\u00e1pida eleva\u00e7\u00e3o dos pre\u00e7os da ra\u00e7\u00e3o, decide abandonar o negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de pintos e focar somente no transporte semi-coletivo de passageiro usando a viatura comprada pelo valor da indeniza\u00e7\u00e3o. Em 2004 decide voltar com a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos dado que os pre\u00e7os j\u00e1 estavam mais acess\u00edveis. Enosse cria atualmente no m\u00ednimo 400 frangos de uma s\u00f3 vez. O melhor negocio segundo Enosse \u00e9 vender j\u00e1 o frango abatido: tem vendido uns 150 frangos por m\u00eas para o Departamento de Finan\u00e7as do Distrito de Namaacha. Porem a venda de frangos vivos tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 lucrativa. Enosse tem tido um rendimento mensal entre MTn 3,000 e MTn 4,000 e n\u00e3o consegue poupar muito devido as despesas familiares.\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo de Enosse com a Hluvuku, porem o primeiro com o Kiva. Com o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 7,000 Enosse comprou pintos e melhorou o seu negocio. Agora Enosse pretende usar os MTn 10,000 para novamente comprar pintos, aumentando a cria\u00e7\u00e3o e os lucros. Assim conseguira reabilitar as capoeiras que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o antigas e precisam de reparos. \r\n\r\nNo futuro Enosse gostaria de aumentar a sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o de pintos, come\u00e7ar a criar poedeiras e comprar uma nova viatura para facilitar as vendas dos frangos. Seu maior sonho, porem, \u00e9 ver um dia seus filhos formados na universidade."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":169990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase

With this loan he will purchase construction materials and he will the wait for a second loan in order to start building his house. This will be Jose's fourth loan with Hluvuku. The prior three loans were used to build his mother's home and they were paid back without any difficulties. \r\n\r\nHe dreams about building a house made of out masonry and, in the future, buying a vehicle. Since Jose lives in a community located  45 minutes away from his mother house, he believes this vehicle will make it easier for him to visit her. Besides that, one of his daughters will have to move in with her grandmother because the local school does not offer high school classes and she will be in tenth grade two years from now.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nJose tem 41 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da Catembe, uma vila de pescadores a 10 minutos de balsa da capital Maputo.

Casada maritalmente, Rabeca \u00e9 m\u00e3e de 3 filhos, com idades entre 10 anos e 1 ano de idade. Rabeca vive com o seu marido, os 3 filhos e dois enteados.\r\n\r\nRabeca trabalhou como empregada domestica durante um tempo, mas depois conseguiu um emprego como faxineira da T.D.M. (Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es de Mo\u00e7ambique), onde recebe um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 1,400. \r\n\r\nSeu marido come\u00e7ou a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de sua casa, mas depois se desinteressou, e por isso Rabeca decide pedir este empr\u00e9stimo para continuar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da casa com material local. Rabeca pede o seu primeiro empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku de MTn 8,000 para comprar material local de constru\u00e7\u00e3o. Ela tem certeza que conseguira pagar o empr\u00e9stimo, dado que as despesas da casa ainda s\u00e3o de responsabilidade do marido. \r\n\r\nConstitui grande sonho para Rabeca  ver a casa conclu\u00edda e mobiliada. Assim que concluir este empr\u00e9stimo e ver sua casa pronta, Rabeca pretende pedir outro empr\u00e9stimo para abrir um pequeno negocio de venda de produtos da primeira necessidade em frente de casa, com vista a realizar mais cedo o sonho de mobiliar a casa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":169994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase

Jabeleu is married and has 10 children. The oldest is 21 years old and the youngest are 3-year-old twin brothers. All of them, except the oldest one, attend school. Jabeleu lives in his own house with his family, although 4 of his children only stay with him during school breaks, because they attend a live-in school.\r\n\r\nJabeleu went to school up to the 12th grade e then he sought a technical degree in Public Management.\r\nJubeleu stopped going to school to prioritizes his children's education. He worked for the state for a few years throughout 4 districts within the Maputo province. Since 2004 Jabeleu set up a small commercial establishment where he sells beverages and basic need products. The best selling product are the national beers. The 2M brand is sold for Mtn 23 each or MTn 230 per case. The Laurentina brand is sold for MTn 25 each or MTn 250 per case. Jabeleu generates MTn 9000 in sales and he is able to save MTN 3000 from that if he does not put too much back into the business. Jabeleu does not have any employees, help comes from his sons and daughters when they are not in school.\r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan from Hluvuku, and his first through Kiva. The first loan in the amount MTn 15,000 was used to purchase merchandise, increase product stock for his commercial establishment so that monthly sales could be improved. In 2006 Jabeleu had already obtained a loan from another small business lender called Tchuma, but he was not happy with it because the credit was given to a group of borrowers. This loan of MTn 20,000 will be used to purchase construction materials to remodel his commercial establishment. Jabeleu wants to attract more students and, in the future, he intends to add a copying machine, a pool table and other games to the school.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Jabeleu wishes to officially get married, improve his family living standards and also start a driving school.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nJabeleu tem 45 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural de Boane na da prov\u00edncia de Maputo. Jabeleu \u00e9 casado maritalmente e pai de 10 filhos, sendo a mais velha com 21 anos e os menores g\u00eameos de 3 anos. Todos freq\u00fcentam a escola, com exce\u00e7\u00e3o da mais velha que j\u00e1 esta no lar. Jabeleu vive em sua pr\u00f3pria casa com a fam\u00edlia, porem 4 filhos s\u00f3 moram com ele nas ferias, porque est\u00e3o estudando em internato. \r\n\r\nJabeleu estudou at\u00e9 12\u00aa classe e depois seguiu uma forma\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9cnica em Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Publica. Jabeleu parou de estudar para dar prioridade a educa\u00e7\u00e3o de seus filhos. Trabalhou para o estado por alguns anos, tendo andado por 4 distritos da prov\u00edncia de Maputo. Desde 2004 Jabeleu abriu um pequeno estabelecimento comercial onde vende bebidas e produtos de necessidade b\u00e1sica. Os produtos mais vendidos s\u00e3o as cervejas nacionais: a 2M \u00e9 vendida por MTn 23 a unidade e MTn 230 a caixa, a Laurentina \u00e9 vendida por MTn 25 a unidade e MTn 250 a caixa. Jabeleu tem um rendimento mensal de aproximadamente MTn 9,000, dos quais consegue poupar uns MTn 3,000 caso n\u00e3o invista muito no estabelecimento comercial. Jabeleu n\u00e3o tem empregados, conta somente com a ajuda de seus filhos quando estes n\u00e3o est\u00e3o na escola.\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo de Jabeleu com Hluvuku, primeiro com o Kiva. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 15,000 foi usado para compra de mercadoria, para aumentar o estoque do estabelecimento comercial e assim aumentar as vendas. Em 2006 Jabeleu j\u00e1 havia contado com um empr\u00e9stimo de outra institui\u00e7\u00e3o de microfinan\u00e7as chamada Tchuma, mas como os cr\u00e9ditos eram em grupo n\u00e3o gostou muito. Este empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 20,000 ser\u00e1 usado para comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para reformar o estabelecimento comercial. Jabeleu quer atrair mais estudantes, e pretende no futuro colocar uma foto-copiadora, uma mesa de bilhar e um jogo de matrequilha. \r\n\r\nNo futuro Jabeleu gostaria de casar-se oficialmente, melhorar

is 51 years old and is originally from the district of Matola in the province of Maputo. He is married and has 6 children: the oldest is 31 years old and the youngest is 13. At the moment only 4 of his children go to school. Jorge lives in his own house with his family and two grandchildren.<p>\r\n\r\nHe attended middle school until the 6th grade but didn't continue his studies due to his parents' financial situation. He has worked as a permanent employee at the reception desk of the IAB  (Instituto Agr\u00e1rio de Boane - Agricultural Institute of Boane) for 20 years.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be Jorge's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. He used his first loan of 5,000 MZN to buy construction material to begin the expansion of his house. His second loan of 7,800 MZN was used to buy a freezer. Jorge intends to use this third loan of 20,000 MZN to purchase construction materials and to pay stonemasons in order to continue extending his house. He has previously had a loan from another micro-lending organization named Tchuma, but he didn't like the group-lending scheme they operated.<p>\r\n\r\nIn future, Jorge would like to build a small commercial establishment infront of his house so that his wife can sell drinks and everyday items, therefore suplementing the family's income. He will be counting on future loans from Hvuluku to do this. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJorge tem 51 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural do distrito da Matola, na prov\u00edncia de Maputo.

O segundo empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 7,800 foi usado para a compra de um congelador. Jorge pretende usar este terceiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 20,000 para continuar ampliar a sua casa, comprando material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o e pagando os pedreiros.

He is married and is the father of 2 boys, the oldest of which is 9 and the youngest, 6. Only his oldest son goes to school as in Mozambique children don't start going to school until they are 7 years old.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1999 Julio and his family moved to Boane in the province of Maputo, looking for work and to better their quality of life. Initially, Julio worked as a traveling salesman, but in 2001 he decided to open his own stall in front of the main market in Boane. Julio sells various products such as household utensils and some clothes. His most popular products are plates (which he sells at 25 MZN each), spoons (which he sells at 10 MZN each) and drinking glasses (which he sells at between 12.5 MZN and 20 MZN). Julio goes to the capital of Maputo by bus twice a week to buy products. He earns between 300 MZN and 1,000 MZN a week, depending on the season and how much it rains. He earns around 7,800 MZN a month but has not yet managed to start saving any money as he has re-invested everything in his stall.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva. Prior to this, Julio had a loan of 6,900 MZN from another microcredit institution named Pro-Credit. He used this money to expand his stall. Julio heard of Hluvuku from friends and chose to ask for a loan as Hluvuku is nearer his place of work.<p>\r\n\r\nJulio intends to grow and expand his commercial activities and one day build his own fixed store within the market.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJulio tem 29 anos e \u00e9 natural de Manjacaze na prov\u00edncia de Gaza. Julio \u00e9  casado maritalmente e pai de 2 filhos, o mais velho tem 9 anos e o segundo tem 6 anos. Somente o primeiro estuda, dado que a idade inicial de estudo em Mo\u00e7ambique \u00e9 7 anos de idade.  <p>\r\n\r\nEm 1999 Julio e sua fam\u00edlia se mudaram para Boane na prov\u00edncia de Maputo a procura de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, isto \u00e9, de trabalho. Inicialmente Julio trabalhava como vendedor ambulante, mas em 2001 decidiu ter sua pr\u00f3pria banca na frente do mercado central de Boane. Julio vende produtos diversos como utens\u00edlios dom\u00e9sticos e algumas roupas. Os produtos mais vendidos s\u00e3o os pratos (vende a MTn 25 cada), colheres (vende a MTn 10 cada) e copos, que s\u00e3o vendidos entre MTn 12.5 e MTn 20. Julio vai 2 vezes por semana a capital Maputo para comprar produtos, utilizando-se dos mini-\u00f4nibus p\u00fablicos. Julio tem um rendimento semanal entre MTn 300 e MTn 1,000, dependente muito da esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano e das chuvas. Por m\u00eas consegue aproximadamente MTn 7,800, mas por enquanto n\u00e3o consegue poupar porque tem investido tudo o que sobra na pr\u00f3pria banca.<p>\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de Julio na Hluvuku e com o Kiva. No passado Julio teve um empr\u00e9stimo de outra institui\u00e7\u00e3o de microfinan\u00e7as chamada Pro-Credit, no valor de MTn 6,900. Este dinheiro foi usado para a amplia\u00e7\u00e3o de sua banca. Julio ouviu falar da Hluvuku por amigos e optou por pedir um empr\u00e9stimo por ser mais perto de onde trabalha.<p>\r\n\r\nJulio tem por objetivo crescer e ampliar sua atividade comercial, um dia construindo o seu pr\u00f3prio estabelecimento fixo dentro de um mercado."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":170039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Manuel is a widower and father of two daughters who both attend high school. His eldest is 16 and is in 10th grade (there are 12 grades in total) whilst his youngest is 13 and in 6th grade.<p>\r\n\r\nManuel finished high school and took a teacher training course at IMAP (Institute of Elementary Teaching) for 2 years. As he didn't find a vacancy at the federal university, he decided to wait for a scholarship from his employer in order to continue his studies. Manuel has been a permanent employee of the Ministry of Education for 17 years. He usually works in the afternoons and receives a monthly salary of 6,000 MZN, from which he manages to save 1,200 MZN unless there are many household expenses.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva. With the loan of 15,000MZN he plans to buy construction materials to continue building\/expanding his house. Last month Manuel received loans from other microlending institutions, but decided to approach Hluvuku when he heard about it from friends. <p>\r\n\r\nManuel doesn't think this loan will be enough to finish the construction of his house and plans to obtain future loans until the project is finished. Once this is done, Manuel also intends to build a small aviary in order to rear chickens.<p>\r\n\r\n <b> Translated from Portugueses by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nManuel tem 41 anos de idade e eh natural de Marracuene, na prov\u00edncia de Maputo. Manual eh vi\u00favo e pai de 2 filhas: a mais velha de 16 anos esta na 10a classe e a mais nova de 13 anos esta na 6a classe. <p>\r\n\r\nManuel terminou o ensino m\u00e9dio e fez um curso t\u00e9cnico de educa\u00e7\u00e3o no IMAP por 2 anos. Como n\u00e3o conseguiu uma vaga na universidade federal, decidiu esperar uma bolsa de seu empregador para continuar os estudos. Manual \u00e9 funcion\u00e1rio permanente do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o fazem 17 anos. Trabalha normalmente nos per\u00edodos das tardes e recebe um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 6,000, dos quais consegue poupar uns MTn 1,200 caso n\u00e3o tenha muitas despesas em casa.<p>\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de Manuel com a Hluvuku e com o Kiva. Com o valor de MTn 15,000 pretende comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para continuar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \/ expans\u00e3o de sua casa. No passado Manuel j\u00e1 contou com empr\u00e9stimos de outras institui\u00e7\u00f5es de microfinan\u00e7as, mas ao ouvir por amigos da Hluvuku decidiu aproximar-se da institui\u00e7\u00e3o. \r\n\r\nComo Manuel n\u00e3o acredita que este empr\u00e9stimo ser\u00e1 suficiente para terminar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da casa, pretende pedir outros empr\u00e9stimos no futuro ate concluir este projeto.

S. lives with his family in Yavan, Tajikistan.

Since she lost her husband, she has held sole responsibility for raising her children. In 1994 she opened a shop selling essential products and dry goods in the Ago\u00e9 district. Her first loan allowed her to build up her stock and sell more. The effect of this first loan was that Madame A. made a large profit that allowed her to pay the school fees for her four children. \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan that she is currently requesting will allow her to purchase five cartons of soap, six cartons of milk, twelve cans of oil and nine cartons of pasta. With this new expanded inventory she will thus be able to increase sales and earn more income. \r\n<p>\r\nThe photo of Madame A. on the Kiva website has been digitally altered because she does not want to have her face displayed.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nN\u00e9e le 31 mai 1967 \u00e0 Nouadja, Madame A.

He is married and has two children, ages 17 and 20. He is the leader of the Kiluvya group (the name means \"community\" in Swahili). He currently runs a photography business in his community near Dar es Salaam, earning a monthly profit of $85. He began doing photography eight years ago. He works from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm daily. \r\n<p>\r\nAndrew has taken out five loans with Tujijenge before, and he has succesfully repaid all of them. With this loan, he hopes to upgrade his camera and equipment, which will allow him to take more pictures of better quality.

He specializes in repairing Yamaha, Honda and Suzuki motorcycles. He has added the sale of motor oil to his main activity. He started this second business because he noticed that a lot of motorcycle owners buy this oil and he sees that he can make a lot of profit from selling it. The first loan he obtained enabled him to set himself up and become operational. The second loan he is requesting will enable him to buy work tools such as sets of keys, a bicycle pump, a generator and 10 cans of motor oil.\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nOriginaire du village de Tokpo dans la pr\u00e9fecture de Zio au Togo, Monsieur G.

Each week he drives his cucumbers to the nearby Kean Svay market and sells his longbeans to a middleman, who then resells them at a slightly higher price to nearby villagers and restaurants in Phnom Penh. His expertise and experience have provided a successful farming career, enabling him to support his children.
