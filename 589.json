She likes this line of work because she does not have to work the whole day to make a living though she does have to start very early in the morning. Yolanda is already used to this schedule and the food preparation business is the main source for her financial stability.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Yolanda also has a sound equipment rental business; this helps her increase her earnings. She has several goals that she would like to achieve, and one of them is to have a spacious commercial location. This is Yolanda's 10th loan with MFP; she feels very happy to be a part of her communal bank because it helps her grow as a person and develop true friendships with the other members of the bank. She will continue to be timely with repayment. Yolanda will use the loan to purchase ingredients for food preparation and to perform maintenance work on her sound equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":761888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients for food preparation, to perform sound equipment maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-30T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.38,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":379.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270266,"comment":null},{"amount":134.37,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":379.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550281,"comment":null},{"amount":134.38,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":379.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718958,"comment":null},{"amount":134.37,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":379.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350427,"comment":null},{"amount":134.38,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":379.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850918,"comment":null},{"amount":134.37,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":379.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666052,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":758.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621204,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-20T07:02:54Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295217,"name":"Magaly Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Magaly Esther M. de 58 a\u00f1os vive en el Municipio de Malambo  donde tiene una miscel\u00e1nea y vende variedades como colonias, cremas elementos de higiene personal, bolsos, loncheras, \u00fatiles escolares y papeler\u00eda.

She has a general store where she sells a variety of snacks, skin lotions, personal hygiene products, handbags, lunch boxes, school supplies, and office supplies. She started out selling cosmetics, taking orders 13 years ago, thanks to a distributor who contacted her now deceased husband. She got her first merchandise on credit and she also acquired a display case. During this time she also started her involvement with micro credit programs with a group. Gradually she strengthened her business and she came across Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and she joined independently, with her first loan recommended by her daughter. With that loan she purchased an ice cream freezer and she invested in office supplies. Gradually she took up specialty magazines to sell her products by catalogues. Lately she has also been selling shoes and ladies' purses. For some time she was investing her own funds but when her husband passed away she and her eldest daughter had to take charge of all the household obligations. she now needs a larger effort to grow and she is in search of business opportunities and financing through her Kiva loan. She wants to increase her working capital and her merchandise to take advantage of the occasions when sales rise, such as Mother's Day.

He would like to buy another cutter so that he can enjoy a better production and increase and improve his sales and income.  He would also like to set up a bakery as this will enable him to continue supporting his children with their studies and continue improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nEugenio says that all his fellow group members are responsible people and good payers.  They have all known each other for a long time since they are from the same community.  They are also very good friends which means that they don't have any problems between them and, up until now, nobody has missed any loan repayments since they are all responsible, punctual and hard working.  \r\n\r\nGe\u00f1o is very grateful to Kiva lenders and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad since, thanks to them, he is getting ahead in life and is able to own his own business, continue supporting himself and enjoy a better quality of life together with his family.\r\n\r\nThe other members of don Eugenio's group are: Romelia, Azalia, Elvia, Apolonia, Mar\u00eda, Vicenta, Sabina, Sonia and Vicenta, who carry out different business activities including: selling meat, fruit, meals, clothes, sweet treats, tamales, soft drinks, groceries and running a bakery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":761401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy the supplies he needs to continue preparing his products such as flour, sugar, yeast, salt, eggs, butter, oil and milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Marcos, Gro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apolonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Divina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2000,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:31Z","rounded_local_amount":23107.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233805,"comment":null},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11553.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512628,"comment":null},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":11553.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223274,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-10T18:32:01Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295228,"name":"Giancarlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Giancarlos  de 35 a\u00f1os  es un hombre que se ha  dedicado a la actividad comercial para generar ingresos  con tal de lograr estudiar y prepararse para el futuro;

She commented that her principle goal is to build her own house, where she can give her daughter sufficient comforts.  \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, she works very hard every morning in her fields.  She has worked as a farmer for three years and her main crop is potatoes.  She plants different varieties of potatoes, which allows her to sell her crops all year long without major difficulties.  This is not the only thing Flor does for a living.  She also raises three cows of a good breed, that give enough milk to prepare cheese that she sells at a good price to her neighbors in her area.    \r\n\r\nFor now she doesn't have major worries, but when Dennis grows up, she will have to invest in a good education and food, so she is saving all of the necessary money to achieve her objectives.

Her brother commented that you can see the progress she has made thanks to her community bank because of how she has succeeded.  \r\n\r\nFlor will harvest the \"yungay\" variety of potato in a few months, so she is anticipating the growing season, and she will plant the potatoes this month.

This community is where \u00c1ngel lives.  \u00c1ngel is 36 years old, single, and studied up to the third year of high school.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel tells us that more than six years ago he started working in his own business so that he could help his parents with their household expenses.  He tells us that he sells shoes and perfumes to friends and neighbors in his community.  He says that he makes his sales door to door through catalogs and, over the years, he has gained more and more customers which has helped his business to prosper.

She only has a second grade education because her parents did not have the financial resources to provide for more education, so she began learning how to work in the home.  Years later she got married to Alfredo, who is a baker.  They have five children, four of whom are now married and the youngest who still lives with them and attends junior high school.  Maria and her family live in San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca.  The Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam is located here, along with a lake that offers much fishing and work to the men of the community.\r\n \r\nShe tells us that her husband knows how to bake and work in a bakery, but a little more than six years ago he decided to start working his own business and taught her how to bake.  Since then, they have been working together in their bakery and she says that they begin baking at noon so that the bread will be hot and ready in the evening so that she can go out and sell it to her friends and neighbors in the community.  She needs this loan to buy flour, milk, sugar, sprinkles, pineapple, and butter for the bread.\r\n\r\nShe expects her business to prosper with the help of this loan, so that she can give a better quality of life to her children and careers in the future.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Felix who is 39 years old and their 4 beloved children who provide the drive for all of their efforts. The green fields of the Palmapampa town are located in a tropical jungle of the Ayacucho department; the area has made Eulalia\u2019s work life a very pleasant one. From a very young age her parents taught her to work the fields which she now does on her own land and works with a lot of care and sacrifice. Today she grows cocoa, coffee and plantains; she owns 4 hectares of land. What Eulalia enjoys most about her work is harvesting her fields since she feels that months of hard work give her the quality of her work. She has worked in this field for 15 years and says that the most difficult aspect of her work is hauling her crops from her Palmapampa community to the collecting centers in the city of San Francisco. Eulalia hopes in the future to get enough money to buy new land. This is her third loan with MFP and knows that she has a responsibility in paying all of her quotas on time and is willing to do it. In her communal bank, she is a member that provides order to the group. With the loan she will buy lumber to fence in the sides of her home since the previous wood is deteriorated.

Kevin inspects buildings for safety and regulation compliance, installs wiring for new construction, and repairs power outages due to on-site malfunction, in addition to installing and repairing solar panels and generators.  He started his business, Spark Electric, AC heating & Gas, in 2006.\r\n\r\nKevin\u2019s first job as a teenager was in the construction industry, though he later took jobs in other fields.  After overcoming personal struggles, Kevin returned to construction to open his own business.  For Kevin, small business ownership is more than a living.  He says that his success as a small business owner has given him confidence in what he can achieve professionally.  He is proud to be an integral part in his local economy, and feels connected to his community.  Kevin is also the proud father of three daughters.\r\n\r\nKevin wants his business to be more competitive in winning subcontracted commissions from commercial contractors.  Currently, Kevin estimates that 25% of his revenues come from work done on large commercial jobs, a number he hopes to improve upon this year.

W.\u2019s restaurant \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d is a southern-style restaurant offering customers traditional home cooking and barbecue.  They make delicacies like oxtail (cow\u2019s tail), which they slice into small pieces and prepare with special seasonings.  Though \u201cJust Passing Thru\u201d has been in business nearly ten years, until now it has only served barbecue.  Wanting to expand the menu to include more of the traditional food he grew up with, Bobby temporarily closed his restaurant to prepare for the new product lines.  \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d recently celebrated its reopening with a \u201cdry run\u201d that tested the new concept.  \u201c\u2019Dry run\u2019 means that we checked to see how the food looked going out the door.  We were known for our barbecue, but they were not used to the home cooking,\u201d says Bobby.  \n\nWith great wit and colorful imagery, Bobby describes his restaurant\u2019s early success since reopening.  After recently taking food to the Humble Police Department, Bobby says that one of the sergeants called to tell him that the food was so good \u201che would be ashamed to take the bone home to his dog.\u201d  With \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d located next to a railroad track, the train conductor calls in his order in advance so that he can pick up his food as he passes through town.  Bobby jokes that \u201cthe food is so good, it literally stops trains.\u201d\n\nBobby knows what it means to put in a full day\u2019s work.  In addition to running his restaurant, which he calls his \u201cextra job,\u201d Bobby is in his 34th year of service as a state trooper.  As if that isn\u2019t enough, he is also a Christian pastor and a family man, with five grown children whom he raised with his wife of 30 years.  Originally from Louisiana, Bobby settled in Texas after graduating from Paul Quinn College in Waco.  \u201cI am from Louisiana\u2026 I\u2019m a country boy.  I went to college because no one I knew had graduated from college.\u201d  \n\nBobby pastors a church that is also on the same property as \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d  \u201cOur food is not as good as the spiritual food,\u201d he quips, \u201cbut it is good.  We would put our food up against any restaurant.\u201d  Needless to say, between working full-time as a highway patrolman, managing his restaurant, and pastoring his church, Bobby stays busy.  \u201cThe Lord is busy right about now in my life... I\u2019m always packing, I\u2019m always loaded.  I\u2019m either carrying a SIG 357 or the 66 books of the Bible.\u201d\n\nWith this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana, Bobby is buying a new refrigerator for the restaurant, which is important because his current fridge is old and fluctuates in temperature.  The remainder of the loan is being set aside to help with general expenses as Bobby navigates the business through its reopening.  Like many of ACCION Texas-Louisiana\u2019s customers, this loan serves the additional purpose of helping Bobby build his business\u2019 credit so that he can qualify for traditional financing in the future.\n\nCurrently, \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d is open weekdays for lunch and on the weekends.  Being limited by his schedule as a state trooper, Bobby is growing the business slowly to make sure that any progress made is sustainable.  He prioritizes serving lunch because, \u201cThere are a lot of hard-working people that need a good meal during the day.\u201d  \n\nOne customer and fan of the restaurant surprised Bobby by creating a \u201cJust Passing Thru?\u201d website.  Though not all of the information on the website is correct, Bobby is appreciative of the gesture and sees the website as something to build from in the future.\n\nCheck out the webpage that was made

Mancuernas is the name of the small town in which they live.  Most of its residents engage in livestock breeding.  This group consists of ten members, most of whom have participated in ten loan cycles with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad as a result of the good service they have received.  For this reason, they continue to seek credit.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Juana S. is one of the members of this group.  She is married to Sr. Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, who is a rancher.  They have six children who are in different stages of their education.  Juana sells meat products such as chorizo and beef enchiladas.  She started her business several years ago out of necessity.  All of her children are in school, some in elementary school and others in high school.  The money her husband earned was not enough, so she came up with the idea of selling these products since she learned how to make them from her mother when she was a teenager.  Juana started out small, going into town and selling her goods house to house.  Over time, she acquired several customers and they recommended her to other people, which expanded her clientele.  She currently sells in other towns because there is plenty of competition.  Juana has some customers who almost make purchases but end up not buying, so she must go to neighboring towns to offer her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy supplies for making her products since they require various ingredients.  Juana must buy them in large quantities.  They include <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chile_de_%C3%A1rbol\" target=\"_blank\" >chile de \u00e1rbol<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guajillo_chili\" target=\"_blank\" >guajillo chiles<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/recipes.wikia.com\/wiki\/Puya_chile\" target=\"_blank\" >puya chiles<\/a>, garlic, onions, cloves, pepper, and pork.  She invests her loans and has always achieved successful results because her earnings have been good.  This allows her to support her children and help her husband with the expenses.\r\n<p>\r\n Juana\u2019s top priority is her family since they have been a great support to her.

She will use part of the loan for typical clothing because Holy Week is in April, and she has had many clothing orders.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to continue working to be able to sustain her business and support her children.  Also, she would like to be able to hire someone in order to be able to sell more.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":762948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cosmetics and typical clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2011-05-03T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4100,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":455.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":455.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":455.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":455.52,"processed_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":462.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216473,"comment":null},{"amount":68.7,"local_amount":512.15,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":520.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494867,"comment":null},{"amount":140.81,"local_amount":1049.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1066.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232785177,"comment":null},{"amount":148.14,"local_amount":1104.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589558,"comment":null},{"amount":63.59,"local_amount":474,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547629,"comment":null},{"amount":67.65,"local_amount":504.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":512.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758226,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-07T00:49:57Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":295543,"name":"Claribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"     \n     La se\u00f1ora Claribel G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez, vive en el barrio de san fr\u00e1ncico, ella  es casada con el se\u00f1or Gabriel \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez Jim\u00e9nez, con quien procreo  tres hijos: Gabriela Lizbeth de quince a\u00f1os, Brianda Itzel  de de siete a\u00f1os y las mas peque\u00f1a es kely claribel de once meses de edad.\n\n    Ella se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9tico  de la marca  avon, en donde lleva seis meses,  y nos cometa que  se inspiro en esta actividad para apoyar asu esposo con los ingresos de su hogar y as\u00ed tener como sacar adelante a su peque\u00f1a  familia.\n\n\n    Cometa que para dedicarse a este peque\u00f1o negocio la animo a una vecina quien tambien se dedica a  distribuir  los productos de avon,   y la invito  que  se asocien  y trabajen juntas as\u00ed tener como obener sus propio dinero.\n\n  Lo que mas desea es que con esta actividad lo tener sus propios a  horros para que  con ello tenga su  propio negocio y  as\u00ed  apoyar a sus hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando.\n","en":"Mrs. Claribel G\u00f3mez P\u00e9rez lives in the San Francisco neighborhood.
