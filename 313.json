Narzullo is 48 years old. He is married and has one child. His main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sairi is 45 years old and married, and she is the loving mother of four children. Sairi\u2019s husband is currently unemployed, so her business is the main source of income for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nSairi has a grocery store where she sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks, detergents and other products. She has been in this business for more than twenty years. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Sairi is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her store to buy groceries again. Sairi wants to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $800 to increase the inventory she has for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nOne of her dreams is that her children progress by means of their studies. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Sairi realize all of her aspirations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to expand her business and better satisfy the needs of her clientele for the end of year holidays, Alphonsine is requesting a third loan with ALID\u00e9.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":398.95,"image":{"id":434017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase drinks (sodas, beers, liquors)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T15:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.05,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alphonsine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":170000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623659,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020364,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858857,"comment":null},{"amount":5.41,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2375.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495077,"comment":null},{"amount":34.32,"local_amount":14700,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":15180.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":136619003,"comment":null},{"amount":39.22,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.78,"payment_id":144652965,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-22T07:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35111.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835045,"comment":null},{"amount":45.41,"local_amount":19300,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":19931.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953921,"comment":null},{"amount":34.59,"local_amount":14700,"processed_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-27T07:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":15180.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055603,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":17555.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347178,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T17:04:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156362,"name":"Nasiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasiba is a very diligent woman of 37 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The product that she sells the most is eggs, which cost MZN 680 a box, and which provides her an income of MZN 7,000 a month. She saves some money on her savings account, at the commercial bank Barclays.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through her sister, who is also one of the institution's clients. This is her 5th loan, of MZN 20,000, with which she intends to buy products (eggs, wine, beverages, beer and others) in order to please her market. Her previous loans were of MZN 10,000; MZN 10,000; MZN 15,000; and MZN 15,000, all of them for the same activity.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she intends to request more loans in order to improve even more the quality of the services she offers to her customers, and to invest on her children's education.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Giovanna Fernandes, Kiva

He is a merchant and owner of his own business and has also worked at SEMOC (which stands for Seeds of Mozambique) as the head of human resources for 9 years.  At the company where he works, he earns a monthly salary of 9,750 meticais and at his business, he earns 3,000 meticais per week.  He saves some of it in his bank account.  He sells meat, flour, beverages, and other items.  He has had loans with another credit organization known as TCHUMA and later became familiar with Hluvuku through his colleagues, so he decided to request his first loan.

He is 51 and is the father of 9 children whose ages range from 18 to 28.  Two of them go to school.  He studied through the 4th grade of the old school system and didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the district of Boane.  He doesn't support anyone besides his immediate family.  He left Matola for Boane to start a pharmacy business and later decided to move his home to this location.  He has owned his own business for 20 years and has 4 employees.  He makes a monthly income of 4,000 to 5,000 meticais and uses it to support his family, pay his workers, and save some in a commercial bank (BIM or BCI).  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend and decided to request his first loan.  This is his third credit and it is for 15,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construcion materials (100 bags of cement) to produce bricks for his home.  His previous loans were both for 8,500 meticais and both were used for the same activity.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to finish his home and to expand the services he offers at his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

They average 39-years-old, with 3 children, and live in the Bagadadji Sud quarter - usually called ATT-Bougou - in the village of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of Mali). They are friends as they grew up together in Bougoufi\u00e9 and were neighbors in public housing (ATT Bougou). After six repaid group loans, they are together for their seventh loan with Soro Yiriwaso. This loan will serve to buy 52 bags of wooden charcoal, 15 pieces of wax pagne cloth, catering products (some Arabic couscous, 30 1-kilogram bags, 60 bags of spaghetti, 25 bags of Sobipal macaroni, 25 kg of beans, 1 can of 20L cholesterol-free cooking oil) and ingredients for various types of incense  (75 bowls of gueni - good smelling roots that grow in humid areas and are used in making incense - 15 bottles of perfume water, 15 perfume bottles). They stock up on pasta in a shop in Hamdallaye; the beans are produced at home by neighboring village farmers; the wax pagne cloth is from the Djogorames at the grand market of S\u00e9gou; the gueni, perfume water and perfume come from the castle market; and the wood charcoal is from farmers in Sakoiba. The food is sold at the S\u00e9gou-Coura market fair and from home; the incense is made-to-order in Bamako for the following organizations: Alpha log, le Tr\u00e9sor, l'APSRU (Association for the Promotion of the Rural and Urban Sector), l'INPS (National Institute of Social Forethought); the charcoal is sold at home at retail and wholesale prices.

When it comes to family life, success depends on how each partner cooperates and supports the other in all endeavors. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie P. has always been open to new opportunities that come her way, especially in business. She is always on the lookout for new possibilities where she could use her skills and business acumen. Because she is not afraid to work hard to achieve her goals, she has already accomplished a lot in her 46 years. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie is married to Pedrito, who is a councilor in their village. Even though he is active in local politics, Pedrito is also an active partner in their hollow blocks factory. \r\n<p>\r\nThey have four children. The two older ones have already earned their college degrees, and the younger kids are still in school. Rosalie's immediate aspiration is for her two remaining children to finish their studies and for their hollow blocks factory to continue to flourish, enabling them to provide employment to more people in their community in Brgy. Cabatangan, Talisay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nRosalie's financial situation today is so much improved from her life years ago. Her first business was a &quot;sari-sari&quot; or general store where she sold just a few items. She was very frugal in budgeting her income, making sure that she set aside some of the income to increase her working capital, but she realized that she could not expand her business if she did not have access to outside capital. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in June of 2002. With the additional capital, she was able to increase her income capacity by adding more items to her goods for sale. Later, she also started selling Ready-to-Wear clothes, and then added a Water Refilling Station to her roster of services. With the additional businesses, she hired people to help her in the business. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was given the opportunity to start a Hollow Blocks Factory, she did not hesitate, because she knew that this would not only help her family, but also provide work opportunities for people in their village. All her business activities now earn a minimum of $293 a month. She saves most of her income for the education of her children and their household expenses. In her previous loan she borrowed 35,000 PHP which she used as working capital for her business ventures. Now that she is into her next loan cycle, she wants to borrow 38,000 PHP so that she can buy another hollow-blocks machine and increase her production capacity.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":430910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Herman earns a living by driving a motorcycle and shuttling people around town for a fee.\r\n\r\nReylene appreciated how much her husband worked hard and sacrificed for their family but she knew that she had to contribute to their family income if she wanted her 2 children to have the opportunities that she aspired for them - to finish college and have stable jobs or be established in their own livelihoods.\r\n\r\nShe decided that a general store that sold a variety of household necessities would be a good business for her, and she was quite successful in this venture. \r\n\r\nBut as the inventory turnover increased because of the higher demand for her goods, she realized that she had to get more capital because it was not practical or economical for her to replenish her inventory every time an item ran out of stock. \r\n\r\nShe needed additional capital so that she could buy higher quantities of the items that are in high demand. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003.\r\n\r\nWith access to additional capital, she was able to increase her income capacity and slowly started to realize some of her dreams. She is now secure that she could afford her children's education and the monthly net income of 7,000 PHP from her business operations is a big help to making their life a little bit more comfortable. \r\n\r\nWith this higher income she has been able to purchase 2 additional motorcycles so that it also earns an additional income for the family.\r\n\r\nReylene previously borrowed 25,000 PHP which she used as revolving capital for her general store. When she paid it off, she applied for a new loan, and now she wants to borrow 27,000 PHP so that she can sustain the optimum inventory levels in her general store, and also do repair and maintenance work on the motorcycles.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":435459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Biao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. Ritchel is 29 years old and her 3 children are between 3 to 9 years old. Ritchel\u2019s fondest hope is for her children to finish college and have good jobs or livelihoods when they grow up.\r\n\r\nRitchel realized early on that if they only relied on one source of income, she would probably not be able to fulfill her dreams for her children. She knew that she had the necessary skills to run a general store but she did not have the capital to even start one. When a friend informed her about how NWTF could help her, she immediately joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make her new business a success, Ritchel worked hard to provide her customers with the items that they needed, and in the 4 years that she has been running the store, her monthly income has periodically increased.\r\n\r\nNow she earns about 24,000 PHP per month from her business activities which includes selling specialty products to her neighbors. Her income from her business activities has enabled her to have their house fixed.\r\n\r\nBecause she wants to pay her loans off in the shortest possible time, she has always borrowed on short terms. She used her previous loan of 19,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business. Maintaining her good credit performance, she paid off that loan within its loan term, and this has enabled her to borrow a bigger loan for the next cycle. \r\n\r\nShe is now borrowing 20,000 PHP for her 9th loan cycle so that she can sustain the inventory levels of her general store.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Ritchel is at the back of her general store, which is attached to her house, with empty bottles waiting for the delivery van to pick up and replenish.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":435463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional capital for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T05:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ritchel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":1538,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849034,"comment":null},{"amount":98.08,"local_amount":4615.84,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4617.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739703,"comment":null},{"amount":130.77,"local_amount":6153.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6155.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129123,"comment":null},{"amount":130.77,"local_amount":6153.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6155.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965919,"comment":null},{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":1538.48,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T09:01:49Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156408,"name":"Genoveva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genoveva is 49 years old and is married to Sixto Zarate.

father always told her that hard work, dedication and being responsible would lead to financial independence and a comfortable life. Mernie A., who is now 46, has always followed this wise counsel. Her husband Joeffrey is a farmer and also helps her run her business.  They live in Purok Mabinuligon, Brgy. Busay, Bago City, Negros Occidental with their 6 children, aged 14 to 25. One of their children already has a family, the 2 youngest are still in school, and the rest are working to help the family improve their lot. Mernie hopes that her business will continue to prosper so that she can earn enough to send her younger children to college and also to invest in other business ventures so that they can increase their family income.\r\n\r\nAs a mother who went through a lot of sacrifices while she was growing up because her family was very poor, Mernie does not want her children to go through the same difficulties of having to earn a living just to help support the family. When she got married, she decided to start her own business by opening a general store. She also raised livestock like pigs and ducks in her backyard, but she stopped this at some point because she needed to revolve her capital faster, and so decided to concentrate on expanding her general store operations.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the necessary capital to expand and diversify her business. As the years passed and she continued to maintain her good credit record, her loans allowed her to sell rice and eggs in addition to her general store. From her business income she was able to buy a small plot of land to grow rice. From her business activities she is able to earn a monthly income of PHP 4,000.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used as additional working capital for her general store and rice business. She was able to repay this amount on time within her loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,500 as additional working capital for her general store and rice business.  This will be her 18th loan. She intends to save some of the additional income for the education of her children, and use some to buy piglets to raise to expand her business.\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They are blessed with 3 young school-aged children. The family lives in the Prk. Waling, Waling Brgy, Busay Bago City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nGeorgita has a general store, a rice business, and also sells gasoline to earn additional income to help her husband sustain the needs of the family and meet their dreams in life. She started her business when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, because she knew that if her husband alone had to generate all of the family's income, it might be too much pressure on him.  She was even worried that their children would not be able to finish their studies. But through their cooperative efforts, she and her husband are reaching for their dreams, but helping each other support their family. Now she earns a minimum monthly income of PHP 6,000, a portion of which she sets aside for the education of their children.\r\n\r\nShe borrowed PHP 8,000 with her previous loan, and used it as additional capital for her general store and other businesses. She was able to earn and repay her loan every week without delay and she was able to fully pay her loan within term. Now, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to be used as additional working capital for her businesses. The income from it will be invested in expanding their business and to invest in the buying and selling of eggs. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":433770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To provide additional working capital for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T22:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":846.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":846.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.24},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2640,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2824.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849036,"comment":null},{"amount":74.61,"local_amount":3283,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739706,"comment":null},{"amount":57.7,"local_amount":2539,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2716.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129125,"comment":null},{"amount":57.69,"local_amount":2538,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2715.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965922,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-26T04:47:53Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156434,"name":"Rosa Mistica Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Rosa Mistica Women\u2019s Committee uses their loan to buy t-shirts, jackets, trousers, blouses, ingredients for pastries and baked goods, vegetables, napkins, yarn, fabrics, jewelry, herbs, milk, vegetables, coal, sugar, flour, herbs, candy, oil, gas, cosmetics, fruit, ladies' underwear, etc. \r\n\r\nThe Committee was formed by several women who took the initiative to organize a group of women to work together to improve their livelihoods and businesses.

Melanie T. lives in Hda. Panaogao Marland, Brgy IV, Silay City, Negros Occidental. Her husband Anselmo works as a laborer in Hacienda on a sugar-cane plantation.  He earns a minimum salary that depends on the time of year:  during sugar milling season, he works six days a week, but during the off-season he works only three to four days a week. The couple is blessed with four children, ages 21 to 27. They work and contribute to help support the household. Melanie dreams of improving their living, fixing their house, buying productive assets and saving enough to support herself and her husband when they grow old.\r\n\r\nShe knew that all these dreams would be for naught if she stayed at home and just waited for her husband to hand her his meager salary. She saved enough from her husband's salary to start a small general store selling only the most in-demand household commodities. When she realized that she needed additional capital to sustain her growing business, it was timely that she heard about the microcredit services of NWTF-Project Dungganon. She became a member in 2004 and from that point on, she never looked back but continued to expand and diversify her business activities. Today, in addition to her general store, she has a rice retailing business where most of her customers are the laborers who work on the sugar-cane plantation where they live. They get the rice on credit for their daily needs and pay back at the end of the week when they receive their salary. She has also put up a barbecue stand. She earns a cumulative net profit of PHP 4,400 per month.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 9,500 was used as additional working capital for her businesses. The loan was fully repaid without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to be used in her general store and for her rice retailing business. She needs this higher capital because sugar milling season has already started and she anticipates a higher demand for all her goods. She will use the income to repair her house and to buy productive assets to be used in her businesses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":430930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional

That\u2019s Ma. Elena H., who, despite her physical imperfection, tries to help her husband and family improve their living conditions. She is 49 years old, married to Rogelio, who works as a sugarcane supervisor. She has two children aged 22 and 28 years old. The family lives in Hacienda Cosolacion, Silay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo help her family earn additional income, Ma. Elena invested in a pig fattening Business, which she managed with the help of her children. Because she wants to add more piglets to her business, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 to access more capital. The loans that she received since then have been used to buy additional piglets, feed, and vitamins for her pigs. Her loans helped to sustain her business and has enabled her to earn PHP 10,000 every time she sells her pigs, which takes 3-4 months to raise. She uses the income to support her children's needs and their household expenses. She is very happy that despite her situation she could earn an income and help her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 8,000 was utilized for her pig fattening business and the amount was fully paid on time without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 15th cycle loan to use to buy feed and vitamins for her pigs. Any profits will be used to defray family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":431016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase adiitional feed and vitamins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T22:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

P. lives in the village of Pader Aguisan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She is 43 years old. Her husband, Rene, works as a fisherman and sometimes as a carpenter. She has three children who are between 11 and 16 years old and they are all presently studying. This couple help each other provide a better future for their children by sending them to school so that they can get a proper education and be able to improve their living conditions. They also work hard because they want to provide a comfortable life for their youngest daughter who has special needs. They plan to send her to Bacolod for special education.\r\n<p>\r\nAlma decided to start a business because she saw that her husband's income was not secure, and she was afraid that if she couldn\u2019t help her husband by earning even a little income, maybe someday they would not be able to afford the education of their children and not have a stable future. This is the reason she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 \u2013 so that she could access much needed capital to put up a general store and have an independent income. As her income capacity increased, she started selling vinegar and later frozen products, earning a good income. Her businesses now earns her 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) per month. She saves most of her profit for the education of her older children and medication for her special child.\r\n<p>\r\nAlma's previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her general store. It was fully repaid without delay and now she wants to borrow 19,500 PHP (her ninth loan) to buy a refrigerator for her general store for the frozen products she sells. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":433938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

M., at 37 years of age, has finally achieved what she had always dreamed of: financial independence. For a long time she worked for others at different businesses. With the severance pay from her last job she decided to start her own business. In the area where she lived there was no hamburger vendor; she didn't think twice, and bought a sandwich cart. At the time she could not afford it, so she obtained a loan and with a lot of sacrifice succeeded. \r\n\r\nJulia says that despite the fact that the neighborhood had no electricity, she went ahead with her plans and inaugurated her new business selling hamburgers. For this event she invited all her friends and neighbors with a special opening deal of half off everything, so that they would find out about her business and taste the products. The opening went very well; what encouraged her the most was the congratulations and good wishes from her close friends and relatives. Currently her business is running well, and, despite the fact that now there is competition, her customers are loyal and continue to buy from her. EDAPROSPO has been a great help to her, as before she bought her raw materials little by little, but with loans she can buy the materials in greater quantities, thus increasing her profits. In this way she helps her husband with the household costs, as they have 3 small children. Over time, Julia has seen the business progress a lot: before she sold in the street, and now she has a store in her own house that she is improving little by little, to provide more comfort to the customers who now come in and eat. This current loan will be used to put the finishing touches on her premises: she will put in a nice floor and improve the bathroom. In the future Julia wants to be the first to sell pizzas in her neighborhood, and for this reason she is currently saving to buy a machine to produce them. She knows she will succeed and thus works with a lot of determination.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":434255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Improve her small restaurant selling hamburgers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicky Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sonia Aurea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Edith Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juanita Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9500,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":831.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669111,"comment":null},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064573,"comment":null},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899633,"comment":null},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933716,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T00:43:10Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156472,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"T.

She and her husband have five children; two are working and three are in school.\r\n<p>\r\nThe grocery business encountered problems because they extended credit to their customers and many were unable to pay. This left the business with a shortage of inventory. As an alternative source of income, Gioconda then started a tortilla business with her sister-in-law.

Se dedica principalmente a la comercializaci\u00f3n de animales: todos los mi\u00e9rcoles viaja hacia los caser\u00edos de la zona y compra aves de corral (patos, pavos) que luego vende a los comerciantes de carne del mercado de la ciudad.

She lives together with her two daughters, 14 and 18, in the San Mart\u00edn sector of the city of Lambayeque, located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nThe separation from her husband motivated her to work to earn the means of support for her daughters.  She is involved mainly in the animal business: every Wednesday she goes to the farmhouses in the area and buys poultry (ducks, turkeys) which she then sells to the meat shopkeepers in the city market.  She sacrifices the birds and sells them ready to be marketed.  This business is the main source of income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nOn the other side, she is involved in the preparation and sale of wine.  She began this business two years ago thanks to the fact that one of her daughters learned the trade in the high school where she studied.  Marcela ferments the drink in plastic buckets and sells it to her neighbors and acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nMarcela wishes to expand her business and enter the goat and sheep market, but she does not have the necessary funds to achieve her goal.  As a result, she has seen it necessary to ask for a loan of 1000 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa for the first time.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a mother that always gives all of herself to help her daughters get ahead.  Her oldest is now studying for a technical degree.  Her biggest wish is to see her two daughters become successful professionals.

She is very responsible with the business, as she carefully splits her time between household tasks and an established schedule to sell her merchandise. Currently she is selling plastic bags of recognizable brands. She sells them in the markets, where there is a greater demand for them in the clothing stands, and the business is very profitable.

She is 34 years old and married with 2 children who depend on her.   With the intention of helping with household costs, she decided to open a small cafe selling prepared meals and snacks, slowly gaining more experience along the way.  She has now been running her business for 3 years, and things are going well.  Over time,  she has become well known and very well liked by her customers.    She continues to run her business, personally attending to her customers with the good nature she is known for.    With the new loan, she will purchase rice, sacks of sugar, various vegetables, eggs and chickens.

is 44 years old and lives with his wife and five children in the Uvurkhangai province of Mongolia.

In order to supplement their income, Zagdzesem also builds homes in the summer months. The family also has approximately 50 heads of livestock which they care for and use.

She will also use a portion of the funds as additional capital for her new clothing business.   \r\n\r\nShe wants to see her mobile phones store to be bigger in the future than what it is now so she could help employ some of her neighbors.

              Carolina B. hails from the attractive municipality of Antipolo, Rizal Province, Philippines. She is a 59-year-old woman and a mother of six children. Four of her children only finished high school; two of them finished a vocational course and an undergraduate college. She is married to her caring husband, Antonio B., a factory worker.\r\n\r\n              Carolina joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance Institution and a KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2004. Since then, she has had access to capital for her business, buying and selling assorted clothes for all ages. The business went effortlessly and successfully. For almost five years of membership in ASHI, she maintained her excellent performance. Now on her eighth loan, she is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000 to purchase additional clothes for sale. Carolina is optimistic that her business will grow because her business also is in demand in the town. \r\n\r\n           Carolina's dream in life is that someday her children may finish their schooling even though they already have their own families. She wants to have steadiness for her future by saving the profits of her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":434694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She believes that if her proposed loan is granted, it will be a big help for the expansion of her business. That is why she is very determined and disciplined to use the money which is lent to her. \r\n\r\nShe disciplined herself to use all the money borrowed from ASHI, a KIVA partner, for her business to gain more profit. This profit is what she uses for daily expenses. She got involved with ASHI because of the family's dreams to send her children to school and finish their studies with a degree. She is a good mother of her two children and still dreams of the best for her family. She belongs to a poor family who needs help to change their standard of living and provide a beautiful house for her family in the future. All of these goals in life are supported by her loving husband, Norman A., a 23-year-old factory worker. Through the love between the couple, they are blessed with one child, Angelica A., 4 years old. This is the story of 28-year-old Gerlie A., a focused mother who is hopeful for her dreams.

C. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 43 years old. Edwina is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Edwina owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling clothing products in the local community. Edwina has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 7,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Edwina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edwina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Edwina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the third loan taken out by Edwina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD.

is Leticia M., a 58-year-old transport operator from Pasay City. She is married to Orlando, a 61-year-old jeepney driver. Leticia is a multi-tasking entrepreneur. She is into rag making, which she started five years ago. Along with production of rags, she maintains a coin-operated video karaoke machine. With still a little time left, she manages the operation of their passenger jeepney, which her husband drives daily. It plies the routes covering the city. They bought the jeepney and acquired a permit for public conveyance three years ago. Leticia earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month from her businesses. Most of the profits go to her grandchildren's education.\r\n<p>\r\nLeticia considers her membership with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative a heaven-sent blessing. She wants to share with friends the many blessings she has received since joining the CCT. She is currently in need of a loan amounting to 22,000 PHP in order to purchase much needed spare parts for the repair and improvement of their passenger jeepney. She believes that their jeepney is God's gift to them.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT: <br>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

H. is 47 and lives with her husband and her two children in Tuv province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her oldest daughter is 24 and a university student in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and her youngest son is 6 and goes to a local secondary school. \r\n\r\nBadamgarav rents a small stall in the Altan-Eh shopping center, one of the town's large shopping centers. She has been selling various food products at her rental stall since 2008. Her retail business has grown fast and her business capital has expanded from 1,000,000 MNT to 4,300,000 MNT ($1 = 1,450 MNT) in a year. She would like to expand her growing business and purchase necessary equipment. She says that she needs to purchase a fridge with a glass cover for selling ice cream and other frozen products. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to purchase a fridge and increase her working capital for her business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001 and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations.

Tapaga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Tapaga is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tapaga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":434780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A., 38 years old, lives in a poor community in Parola, Tondo, Manila \u2013 a shanty town at the edge of Manila Bay.  Her husband Rodrigo is a driver.  One of their two children is now in grade school.\r\n \r\nMaricar\u2019s general store has been in operation for two years.  Her neighbors buy rice, grocery items and other basic household necessities from her store.  She also has a soft drinks dealership.  Maricar makes a net revenue of about P15,000 a month.  She uses her profits to sustain daily family needs and to support her child\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe is among the newest members of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She has just finished repaying a previous loan to the cooperative.  She has applied for a new loan of P9,000 as additional capital to continue the growth of her business.  She will use this loan to restock non-perishable grocery items, rice and soft drinks at her store.\r\n\r\nMaricar wishes to see her store to grow to the size of  a mini-mart or a supermarket someday.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Onolina has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Onolina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Onolina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Onolina is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Onolina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay tuition fees for her children.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

F. is a 49-year-old woman living in the town of Asau.  She is married and has 5 adult children.  To make a living, Eteli owns & operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Eteli has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eteli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eteli has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Eteli is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Eteli plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She also runs a side business selling snacks, fish and vegetables. She has been engaged in her businesses for over ten years and earns approximately 18,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anafe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\r\n\r\nAnafe is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in another business. This loan will be her 2nd from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the businesses to purchase additional inventory, to use as working capital, and to pay off her weekly obligations to HSPFI.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

is 30 years old, married with one child who is 4 years old .

This is her 8th year of successful operation in this business!

is 25 years old and is single. She takes care of her brother and a 3-year-old orphan of a deceased relative. She lives in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nJeanne is a hardworking businesswoman, owning and operating a popular local restaurant in which she employs ten people. This is her 4th successful year in business. The hours of her business require that she works from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nJeanne struggles to make a profit each month and believes that she does not carry enough variety of drinks and food.

 U. is a 26-year-old woman living in the town of Salelologa.  She is married and has 3 children.  To make a living, Lita  owns & operates a clothing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing dress-making services to local community members.  Lita  has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lita  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lita  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 400 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional equipment & implements such as needles & thread.  Lita  is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lita  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to make improvements to her house.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

is a young Palestinian man aged 27 years. He is married with three young children aged 4, 3 and 1 years old.\r\n\r\nZiyad owns a shop in Khanyounis, south of Gaza City at Gaza strip. In this shop he sells spare parts and accessories for motorcycles. In addition to that, he also fixes them and fixes bicycles, too.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to viable business opportunuties. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On average they are 26 years old with one child, and they live in the Military Camp of Segou (4th Administrative Region of the Republic of Mali). They came to know each other through their community ties (as they are all either children or wives of soldiers), and they are part of the same traditional association for mutual assistance.\r\n\r\n<p>This group of women buys and sells various types of commercial items. In hopes of increasing the volume of their business, they decided to join the credit program of Soro Yiriwaso from which they are taking first joint loan. This loan will be used to buy 80 pairs of sandals and baby shoes, a wide variety of creams, body lotions, hair pomades, 40 bottles of perfume, deodorant, 50 packets of hair extensions, a half bale of children's sweaters, food condiments (1 basket of fresh tomatoes, 2 large cans of tomato concentrate, 1 bag of cabbage, 6 packets of various Maggi cubes: Maggi chicken, jumbo, Maggi onion), 2 kg of pepper, 25 kg of meat and liver, and ingredients for shish kebabs. They purchase the shoes in Segou and Bamako, the beauty products from the general market of Segou, the hair extensions in Bamako, the second-hand clothes and condiments from the weekly fair in Segou, and the meat, liver and grilling ingredients from the \"ch\u00e2teau\" market. The items are resold either in the Segou Coura market, from home, or by traveling in the area and inside the military camp. The sales are made in cash, in retail, and by credit to a customer base of women and men. They hope to make an average monthly profit of 24,500 FCFA which will be used to repay the loan, to satisfy small family needs, and to participate in social events.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>NB: Fatoumata Diabat\u00e9 is absent from the group photo due to a funeral.<\/p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Jarred Taylor, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":434955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buying various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Massan     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yah \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8                                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763587,"comment":null},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152420,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991262,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021532,"comment":null},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746334,"comment":null},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":67452.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778886,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T01:00:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":156822,"name":"Gunsennorov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gunsennorov N. is 45 years old and lives with his wife and three sons in Zavkhan province in Mongolia. He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent. His oldest son works as a carpenter and his youngest two are both university students. \r\n<p>\r\nN. operates a transportation service in his town. He uses his large van to transport people to his province from the surrounding provinces and back again. N. started his business in 2000 and has gained much experience and a good reputation as a driver over the years. In 2005 he used his savings to trade in his old van for a new one. \r\n<p>\r\nHis business is very important to him and he works hard so that he can provide for his children's education. He must pay 4,500,000 tugrugs (~3100 USD) tuition each year for both of his youngest sons. It is quite expensive in Mongolia, but he says, \"Education is the one thing that helps people get decent jobs and lead happy lives. For that reason, all I want is to support my son's education.\" \r\n<p>\r\nN. is requesting a 3,000,000 tugrug (~2100) loan to purchase machinery parts for his van and pay a portion of his son's tuition fees.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout XacBank\r\n<p>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Agalua has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Agalua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Agalua has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Agalua is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Agalua plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Taualofa is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.

They have been blessed with five children, namely Mark, who is in college; Sophie and Moses, who are in high school; and Jepkurui and Jemutai, who are in the primary level of schooling.\r\n\r\nDinah runs a grocery and owns a kiosk, which she started four years ago. She gets a profit of 800 Kenyan shillings per month from the business and her additional income comes from her husband and college-going son, who does menial labor. \r\n\r\nDinah has borrowed Kshs 10,000 from KADET LTD., a Kiva partner, and this will be her first loan from an MFI. She wants to buy half a sack of maize flour for kshs 1,200, 10kg of sugar for Kshs 900, bar soap for Kshs 800, tea leaves and sweets for Kshs 600 and paraffin for Kshs 500 for her kiosk. For her grocery business, she wants to buy sukumawiki (kale), cabbages, onions and tomatoes for Kshs 4,000. The remaining Kshs 2,000 she will save for restocking her business in a future period.\r\n\r\nDinah\u2019s business is situated along Nakuru-Kabarnet highway and her customers are mainly residents of Chemogoch, who are low-income earners and travelers who pass by the Nakuru-Kabarnet highway. If this loan boosts her business, she plans to smoothly repay the loan and diversify her stock by purchasing goods that she has not stocked before. Dinah dreams of being able to educate her children to the highest level possible and she hopes to acquire a pick-up truck in the next four years. This will enable her to expand her retail business by accessing interior areas.\r\n\r\nDinah describes herself as a born-again Christian and a loving and dedicated mother who likes to offer guidance and counseling to children and teenagers. She believes she is a good planner, kind, cheerful and always ready to help others.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout KADET:\r\n\r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is dedicated to economically empowering its clients by providing financial services to improve the living conditions of micro-entrepreneurs and their children across Kenya.

The youngest is 22 years old and helps take care of the crops, but then has to go and study. \r\n\r\nNow Abdulahat needs a loan of $1,300. He is planning to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer for sowing his crops. His goal, with time, is to plant larger quantities and to educate his children. With your help, this will be possible.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
