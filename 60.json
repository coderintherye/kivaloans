G. is 44 years old, finished high school, married, has five children. Sharif lives in the village Obi-Keek, in the Hurossonskiy district and in the last 10 years has been raising and fattening cattle for sale. Until now he never took out a loan, since he didn't think anyone would loan him money. Sharif is planning to use the loan money to buy more cattle for fattening and sale. Every 40-45 days he will sell the bulls and use the money to pay back the loan, purchase the calves and family needs. With time he is hoping to save enough money and use it to expand his business. The client is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

Gulnoza has been in the business of selling woolen yarns and socks for 10 years. She is married and has 3 children. The whole family lives together with their mother-in-law. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a stable well paying job, her husband decided to breed sheep, whose wool Gulnoza is selling and using in socks knitting. Her mother-in-law has taught her to do that and now this is their main source of income. Her daughters also knit socks and help their mother. Her husband and son take care of wool processing, cleaning, and drying. This business involves their whole family. \r\n<p>\r\nGulnoza wanted to use the loan from Kiva to purchase a different kind of wool - angorka, so she could mix it when knitting socks. That way, she will be able to raise the prices of her goods and obtain higher earnings. These winter months are the best season for sales of warm wool socks.

She has 2 daughters, both who are young and high school students. <p>\r\n\r\nShe has a small business where she works hard to buy fish at wholesale and sell at retail. She has been a seasoned vendor 20 years and already has stable client base. <p>\r\n\r\nShe started out traveling around and selling fish in the small center of Asunci\u00f3n (capital of Paraguay).  Later, together with her husband, they bought a motorcycle and sold fish in regions far from their home.

The menu varies but is composed of fish and beverages.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan they request will be used to buy more fish and vegetables, condiments, and sodas for their canteen. \r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

Things have changed for the better for her family. After each round of loan, she has been able to put away some savings to buy basic things for her family: tv, motorcycle ... The family income is about 100 USD a month. This time she is requesting a loan of 650 USD to buy a pair of breeding cows. She hopes that after a few months, they would produce calves so that she would be able to recuperate her investment quickly.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb B\u1eafc, 33 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 3 con nh\u1ecf t\u1ea1i Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac.

This is a skill that is passed on from generation to generation in this town. Since the economy in the region was not good before 2000, it did not generate enough revenue for her family but she just kept continuing to preserve the skill. In the last couple of years, the region's economy picked up and so did her business. Her family living condition had improved. For the last 3-4 years, she had applied for maximum loans to be invested in her business. Her family income is now 200-250 USD a month.

She produces religious objects (that are displayed on an altar) and sells to the locals.
