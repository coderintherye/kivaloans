She is requesting a loan so that she has can buy larger quantities of higher quality fruit to sell.  In the Dominican Republic, it is very common for people to buy pieces of fresh fruit on the corners as they walk to work, their homes, or simply when they are out and about. The money from this loan will help her make more money by enabling her to buy enough fruit to meet the demand she will face. She hopes that her business will continue to grow with the help of this loan, and that with the profits she will be able to continue providing for her family.

Because she lives along a main road, there are many travelers who stop at her house for gasoline.  She enjoys being able to work from home because she can spend time taking care of her kids, cooking and cleaning the house.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Aida\u00b4s first loan with Esperanza.

It has been ten years since Petronila opened her grocery in the area of Costa Pe\u00f1a de Acahay with the help of her father-in-law, who gave her a house located in an area well-suited for her business. <p>\r\n\r\nIn order to start her grocery, Petronila had to sell a cow her family owned. With this sale, she was able to buy merchandise, such as rice, noodles, grass, oil, etc, for her business. Thus, they were able to begin this activity in order to go forward. <p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the profit that this activity has generated for Petronila, she was able to pay for her children\u2019s education, and these children now have families of their own. <p>\r\n\r\nBefore this activity Petronila and Crisp\u00edn worked only on agriculture, and according to Crisp\u00edn, now it is not possible to live only off of agriculture because there is no venue to market the goods. As a result, they work at the grocery so that they can settle their expenses. Their dream is that their grandchildren have a place where they can work and spend their free time. <p>\r\n\r\nThey are requesting a loan so that they can buy an industrial stove with six burners with which they will be able to cook food and serve it to workers and office workers in the area. At present they are beginning to earn good profits serving food to some workers in the area. As a result, Petronila wants to increase the number of people that eat lunch at her business. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by A.

With the loan, she plans to expand her inventory of rice, oil, plantains and other food.\r\n<p>It is Maxima's ambition to continue growing her business so that she can continue providing for her family. She insists that her children continue studying so that they can be productive members of society, and hopes that she herself will always progress in both her personal and economic life. On behalf of everyone here at Esperanza International, and from Maxima herself, we thank you for your support with this micro loan!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":176744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy various food products, such as rice, oil, and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-07-04T06:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eridania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfonsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":109000,"loan_amount":3200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":18166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":18166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":534,"local_amount":18189.38,"processed_date":"2008-09-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-13T07:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":18307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324323,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":534,"local_amount":18189.38,"processed_date":"2008-10-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":18307.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356780,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":532,"local_amount":18121.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:55:14Z","rounded_local_amount":18239.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312775,"comment":null},{"amount":533.33,"local_amount":18166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":18284.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930322,"comment":null},{"amount":533.33,"local_amount":18166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":18284.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854896,"comment":null},{"amount":533.34,"local_amount":18166.65,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":18284.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394182,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-29T16:14:03Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:09:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54807,"name":"Graciela","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Graciela is 39 years old.

The very tight economy makes supporting her growing family difficult, especially because she must pay for her children's schooling.  Because her husband's income as a farmer is not enough to meet her family's needs, Ketut Santi has started to raise pigs at her home.  After receiving her first loan, Ketut Santi was able to purchase 1 sow and one piglet for fattening.  The sow has since given birth to 10 piglets.  By selling the piglets and the fattened pig, Ketut Santi made a profit of 1,500,000 Rupiah in 6 months.  With this profit she repaid her first loan and would now like to secure another loan to purchase another sow and pig feed.  With this additional sow she hopes to bring in even more profit than she did with her first loan.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Courtenay Teska Race, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nIbu Ni Ketut Santi tinggal disebuah desa di Berawantangi \u2013Tukadaya, dengan kondisi ekonomi yang sangat pas-pasan dan dipersulit lagi dengan kebutuhan keluarga yang tinggi serta ditambah harus menyekolahkan anaknya.

Setelah mendapat pinjaman dari DINARI serta pembinaan yang cukup, Ketut Santi mampu membeli 1 ekor induk babi dan 1 ekor bibit babi penggemukan. Setelah dipelihara, induk babi tersebut melahirkan anak babi sebanyak 10 ekor. Dari penjualan bibit-bibit babi serta babi penggemukan miliknya tersebut Ketut Santi mampu mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 1.500.000,- selama 6 bulan. Selanjutnya Ketut Santi kembali meminjam ke DINARI untuk menambah modal dari keuntungan yang didapatkan dari pinjaman pertama yang akan digunakannya untuk membeli 1 ekor induk babi lagi serta membeli pakannya. Dengan tambahan induk peliharaan diharapkan akan mendatangkan keuntungan yang lebih dari sebelumnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":176892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a sow and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-07-05T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-19T23:49:57Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-08-20T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":275271.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301504,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-09-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":275271.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332251,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":275271.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366378,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":213333.32,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:35Z","rounded_local_amount":244686.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308504,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":233333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":267625.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925436,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":233333.35,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-04T09:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":267625.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849729,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-05T23:49:57Z","paid_date":"2009-03-04T09:01:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54862,"name":"Homit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Homit H. sells cattle.

This result would decide the economical road of Komang Wati's family that also has to provide child schooling.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nPemeliharaan yang sederhana dan tradisional pada ternak babinya dirasakan tidak menghasilkan hasil yang maksimal oleh Komang Wati. Padahal dari memelihara babi Komang Wati mengharapkan hasil yang baik untuk menunjang perekonomian keluarga. Komang Wati memelihara 1 ekor babi penginduk. Kemudian Komang Wati mengambil keputusan untuk meminjam modal ke DINARI yang digunakannya untuk menambah populasi babinya dengan membeli 1 ekor penginduk lagi serta 1 ekor bibit penggemukan. Dari kedua penginduk tersebut menghasilkan 12 ekor anak babi yang dijual @ Rp. 175.000,- ditambah penjualan babi penggemukannya didapatkan keuntungan bersih sebesar Rp. 1.500.000,- selama 6 bulan. Komang Wati meneruskan pinjaman selanjutnya ke DINARI karena dianggap sangat menolongnya mengembangkan usaha. Pinjaman berikutnya akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan serta 2 ekor bibit penggemukan sehingga akan menambah keuntungan yang diperoleh pada 6 bulan berikutnya. Hasil ini menentukan jalannya perekonomian keluarga Komang Wati yang juga harus menyekolahkan anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":176906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglets and feed (Membeli anak babi dan pakan)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-07-07T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-21T22:46:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":279477.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303495,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T01:53:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":279477.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351699,"comment":null},{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":453333.32,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":527902.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308509,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":466666.68,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":543428.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-07T22:46:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54870,"name":"Ni Made Ekarini","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Ni Made Ekarini is considered a young woman, but her persistence in work is considred as high.

H. lives in the Istaravshan town of the Sugd region. He is 40 years old, married, and has two children. He has a secondary education and an animal husbandry business. Specifically, he has a small cow house where he breeds calves. Because he does not have a specialized education, animal husbandry is the only source of income for his family. In practice, he buys calves at the market for a low price, then feeds them and later re-sells them at the same market for a profit. As such, he provides the market's customers (as well as his family) with meat. <p>\r\nHe is now seeking to buy more calves and thus needs money, so he decided to apply for a loan in the amount of $400 over a 10-month term. With the loan proceeds, he hopes to expand his business and to thereby generate additional income in order provide his children with a good education and to improve their standard of living. Indeed, this loan would help him to accomplish his goals in a short time, so your generosity is much appreciated in that it can change his life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":176919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand and improve his business by purchasing additional calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-07-15T09:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rustam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-11T10:52:13Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2008-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-08-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":309614,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340758,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323690,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943353,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220439,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409376,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102423,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35996665,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44579479,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973028,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-28T10:52:13Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T21:44:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54878,"name":"Zakir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zakir B. is a 47-year-old salesperson who owns a grocery store in the small village of Imishli.

Before joining the TYM Fund, she had lots of difficulties in life because she had too many children but did not earn enough money. In 1995, she joined the TYM Fund and borrowed 20 USD at first. She used this money to raise the pigs and chickens. From 1995 to 2000, she continued to use the borrowed money on raising pigs, chickens and fish, earning 800 USD\/ year. In 2001, seeing that local people and those living nearby enjoyed decorative plants, she switched to this activity. She bought the pots, the seeds and planted them. She distributed her plants to the hotels, and retailed. She also did not stop raising animals. Because the business went well, her family economy improved. She has 5 children, 3 of whom are grown-up and living separately, and the other two are still going to school. This time, she wants to borrow 1150 USD to invest more in the decorative plants business. Her average income is 400 USD\/month. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 51 tu\u1ed5i.

In 1999, her family became a small retailer, selling bran, corn and rice as foodstuff for breeding cattle.

Making brick was very difficult, yet it didn't bring back much profit. Thus, in 2001, Ms. T. switched to breed chickens and hens.  At the moment, her farm has about 500 hens.  Each day there are about 300 eggs, which is sold for 28USD.  After deducting all other expenses, Ms. T.'s daily income is about 10 USD.  Ms. T. has 3 children who are still going to school.

Mrs. L.'s family are living at Soc Son province, Hanoi, where the Noibai industrial areas have been developing with a very fast rate.  Thus, the demand for consumption is very high and various.  Before joining TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam), Mrs. L.'s family had owned a small retail store.  However, their income was still low because they didn't have much fund to begin with.  In 2002, Mrs. L. applied to join TYM, borrowed money and expanded her business (clothing store).  With her experience and cleverness, Mrs. L.'s family becomes better off.  In 2006, L. and her husband switched to sell old and new motorbikes.  Each motorbike sold gives them a profit of 500,000 to 1,000,000VND (approximately 31-62USD).  Currently, their store often has about 15 motorbikes.  She wants to borrow 19,000,000 VND (approximately 1150 USD) to invest in her business.\r\nMrs. L.'s family income is about 8,000,000 VND (i.e., 500 USD) per month.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb L.  40 tu\u1ed5i.

In the following years, her family was raising poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs, which has brought Mrs. T. more profit.  In 2005, Mrs. T. started to buy pork and transport pigs to China by her own car, which is the begining of her food delivery business.  Currently, Mrs. T.'s family focuses on food delivery to China.  Mrs. T. has 3 children, one of which is still going to school.  Her husband is the driver for her business.  Besides, if some other companies have a need for driver, he also takes the opportunities. This time she wants to borrow 19,000,000 VND (approximately 1150 USD) to buy more pigs.\r\nMrs. T.'s family income is about 8,000,000 VND (i.e., 500 USD) per month.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb To\u00e0n 49 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia Qu\u1ef9 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 bu\u00f4n b\u00e1n h\u00e0ng kh\u00f4 nh\u01b0 m\u0103ng, mi\u1ebfn.

This area is known for its handmade crafts such as bedspreads, sashes and hammocks.  Many of the area\u2019s artisans used to export their products to Argentina and were hard-hit after the 2002 Peso devaluation.  As a result, many families were forced to start from scratch with their businesses and find clients on the national market.\r\n<p>\r\nVirgilio sells the products that his parents make or that he buys from other families in Carapegua.  His parents use a loom to weave cotton and then use the fabric to create bags, bedspreads and \u201cfajas,\u201d or traditional Paraguayan sashes.  Virgilio makes most of his sales in Cuidad del Este, selling to store owners who sell products to tourists.  When he travels to Cuidad del Este, he also takes along extra items that he sells on credit or for installment payments.  In addition, he has also found a market for his products in the indigenous community; he sends the items and then his father goes to collect payment.  In November, Virgilio goes to Caaguazu to sell bedspreads to the cotton formers, collecting the money in April when they\u2019ve sold their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nVirgilio is very familiar with the Paraguayan artisan trade and he would like to be able to increase his business.  He currently has a large number of clients and is eager to buy a vehicle for when he has to travel long distances to make sales, reduce his travel costs and increase his profit margin.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is requesting a loan to be used for the purchase of different-colored cotton threads so that his parents can weave additional bedspreads this winter and purchase merchandise from the local artisans.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Chegezy, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nVirgilio SantaC. tiene 24 a\u00f1os y vive en la  compa\u00f1\u00eda Tayy Loma  de Carapegua,  Esta zona es conocida por sus productos hechos a mano como las sobrecamas, fajas y hamacas. Muchos de las artesanos de la zona exportaban a la Argentina y fueron gravemente afectados por la ca\u00edda del Peso en el 2002. Por esto, muchas familias tuvieron que reiniciar sus negocios y encontrar clientes en el mercado nacional.\r\n<p>\r\nVirgilio vende productos hechos por sus padres y que compra de otras familias en Carapegua. Sus padres usan un telar para tejer el algod\u00f3n y despu\u00e9s usan la tela para armar bolsos o sobre telas y \"fajas,\" cintos tradicionales paraguayos. Su mayor venta lo realiza en Ciudad del Este a comerciantes que  realizan venta  directa  a  turistas . En este viaje tambi\u00e9n lleva mas productos los cuales vende a cr\u00e9dito o por cuotas.

She runs a grocery business from a stall she rents at a large open air market in Kampala, where she sells tomatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, bananas (known locally as matooke), Irish potatoes and a ground nut paste that she makes herself.  She buys her produce from a market in the center of town, and gets matooke from an outlying village.  She manages her stall by herself six days a week, with Friday and Saturday being her busiest days.  She has operated this grocery business for the past 10 years.  Before that, she waited tables at Makarere University, but the salary was not enough for her and her family.  On her own, she knows she can have all of the profits, and she finds the market a much better place to work.\r\n<p>\r\nStill, she faces considerable challenges.  Power outages often make it impossible for her to use the machine that grinds the groundnuts into paste.  At home, she doesn\u2019t have power at all but uses paraffin lanterns, and she gets water from a nearby pump.\r\n<p>\r\nDeborah has been a member of MCDT for the past seven years and, working with her group, has received numerous loans.  She says that getting these loans has changed her life, giving her the capital needed to maintain her business and send her son to school.  With a new loan, she will expand her business, buying more stock to sell.  She also wants to finish building a home, so that she no longer has to rent.  Her eventual goal is to build houses that she can rent out to others."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":177026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies for a grocery store and finish work on a house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-07-05T05:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-20T22:56:40Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303178,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-09-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334030,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-25T07:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368381,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":156.33,"local_amount":246842.11,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":252322,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334428,"comment":null},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":255550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955622,"comment":null},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":255550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14875993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-07-06T22:56:40Z","paid_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":54961,"name":"German","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p> German is 31 years old and married to Carolina Candia.

B. is married and has eight children. Health problems have rendered her not strong enough to cultivate crops, which is the main economic activity in her community. As a result, she has resorted to rearing animals which is less strenuous. However, prior to joining GHAPE, inadequate capital meant she could not earn enough to meet the needs of her children and family. Motivated by other GHAPE members in her community, she joined the program and has been successfully receiving and repaying loans ever since. The profit she gets from her business is used to pay the school fees for her children. \r\n\r\nGiven this loan, she plans to repair her pigsty, buy more piglets and fowls, and buy feed for her pigs and fowls. Her community will benefit from this in that there will be more good quality meat and manure (from the pigs) at their disposal for a better standard of living. Her family will benefit from additional income to improve their lifestyle.\r\n\r\nElizabeth B. plans to repay this loan in 24 months. The first installment repayment will be made on the fourth month from

She was born in Boane and, lived in the district of Namaacha and, when she was fleeing the war, she also lived in the city of Maputo, completing the 6th and 7th grade there.

Her daily shift is from 8:00am to 3:30pm. Fatima learned this skill at ADDP (African Disability Decade Programme). Her monthly salary is 4000,00mt and she is able to save 1000,00mt from that.\r\nThis is Fatima's second loan request from Hluvuku -- she has never requested it from another instituition.

She is from Caia, a province of Sofala in the central part of Mozambique. She is married and has three sons that are 21, 20 and 18 years old. Besides supporting her three sons she also supports a nephew that lives with them.\r\nAdriana attended school up until the 6th grade. She did not continue her education due to financial reasons. In 2000, she left Sofala for Maputo through the church she attended and was involved in. She set up residence in Boane where she still lives. She has her own home located in zone 07.\r\nIn 2006, she opened up a business that sold tobacco and, in 2007, she introduced a chicken raising and slaughtering business with help from an assistant. She learned how to raise chickens with friends and she has been doing it for a year now. The venture has been doing well despite difficulties in transportation and the rising cost of purchasing hens and tobacco. Weekly, she can sell up to 700,00mt - she has sold a can of tobacco (250g) for 10,00mt and a chicken for 90,00mt. She has not started to save yet because she prefers to invest all in the business.\r\nThis is her third loan from Hluvuku. The first two were used to purchase tobacco and with the profits she strenghtened the chicken raising business. She now requests 14500,00mt to expand her chicken raising business. \r\nAdriana wishes to pay back the loan early so that she can request another loan to build additional aviaries and improve her housing conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nAdriana Bernardo L. tem 41 anos de idade, natural de Caia provincia de Sofala ao centro de Mo\u00e7ambique.

L. is 46 years old. He is married and he had 6 children. The oldest one is 26 and the others are 21, 13, 11, 8 and 1 year old respectively. The are all in school except for the youngest one. Besides his sons and daughters, he also supports his mother and nephews that live with her by sending money and food. \r\nSousa went to school until the 8th grade and because of his family situation he had to start working at an early age to cover the expenses, worse yet, there were no evening classes available at that time. Sousa worked for a pottery company in Mozambique that awarded him in 1981 with a 3-year scholarship in Cuba. He still receives pension payments from that company. He lives in his own home.\r\nIn 1989, Sousa built an iron shop that later had to be passed on to his ex-wife when they were divorced. Sousa is now self-employed. Since 1999 he has been running a restaurant he built with his own resources. The restaurant opens at 8:00am and closes at 9:00pm; it has 3 employees. He learned the skills needed on his own when he realized that his salary was not enough to pay for his family\u00b4s needs. The best selling dish is pork meat which goes for 80,00mt and costs him 45,00mt. His monthly income is 12000,00mt and from that amount he saves 3500,00mt.\r\nThis is his second loan request in his life and first through Kiva. The first loan was in the amount of 10000,00mt given by BPD (People\u00b4s Development Bank) and it was used to build the iron shop his ex-wife now owns. The second loan will be used to purchase a variety of products for the restaurant, thus, increasing sales. \r\nIn the future, with help from other loans, Sousa intends to open up a butcher\u00b4s shop to sell meat and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nSousa L. tem 46 ano de idade, casado maritalmente e pai de 6 filhos sendo de 26 anos de idade o primeiro, 21 o segundo, 13 o terceiro, 11 o quarto, 8 o quinto e um ano o sexto. Todos ainda estudam excepto o menor de todos. Para al\u00e9m dos seus filhos sustenta a sua mae e seus sobrinhos que vive com a sua mae enviando dinheiros ou generos alimenticios.\r\n\r\nSousa estudou at\u00e9 Oitava Classe e por situa\u00e7\u00e3o familiar teve que come\u00e7ar a trabalhar muito novo para sustentar a familia e como  na era nao tinhas escolas que davam aulas de noite. Sousa trabalhou na ceramica de Mo\u00e7ambique empresa que lhe deu bolsa para estudar em Cuba em 1981 por tres anos, empresa que at\u00e9 hoje se benificia de uma pensao. Vive numa casa pr\u00f3pria.\r\n\r\nEm 1989 Sousa construiu uma ferragem qual teve que deixar com  sua primeira esposa, quando se divorciaram.  Sousa trabalha a conta pr\u00f3pria, onde desde 1999 explora um estabelecimento (Restaurante) constru\u00eddo por fundos pr\u00f3prios o Restaurante abre as 8:00h e fecha as 21:00h e tem 3 empregados. Aprendeu o trabalho por inciativa pr\u00f3pria quando viu que o salario n\u00e3o respondia as necessidades da casa.

Mayo Group have worked together for nearly five years and are now requesting their eighth loan from Friendship Bridge.  Of the seven women in the group, two sew pants and shirts, two embroider traditional blouses, two buy clothing in bulk for resale, and one grows and sells vegetables and chickens.  All of the women sell their products in the local market in Santa Lucia, and some travel to nearby Nahual\u00e1 to have access to a larger market.  \r\n\r\n<p>These women range in age from 26 to 54 years old and all but one of them are married and have children.  About half of them have had at least a little education, although none has completed more than the sixth graD..  Those who have not had any formal education cannot read or write, and sign all paperwork with a fingerprint.  Regardless of how much education each woman has had, every one of them has maD. her children\u2019s education a top priority.

Before they had access to credit, many were unable to pay the small costs associated with sending their children to school.  Now, with the help of loans, they are able to work more and fight for a better future for their children.  More directly, those working in clothing-related industries will use their loans to purchase cloth, thread, patterns and clothes in bulk, while the woman selling vegetables and chickens will use her loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and more chickens.\r\n\r\n<p>Several of the women also report that, in addition to being able to expand their businesses and send their children to school, having access to credit has enabled them to make improvements on their houses, such as getting better roofs or buying more cinder blocks to have more solid walls.  When asked what they like most about working together in the Flor D. Mayo group, they all agreed that it is a great group because everyone always pays on time and there is a lot of trust among the members.  They also report that they have found the informal education programs that Friendship Bridge offers at the regular group meetings to be very helpful.  Not only have they learned basic business administration and money management skills, but several say that their favorite lesson of all was learning about natural medicines such as plants, some of which they already had on hand although they never knew the benefit they could proviD..  \r\n\r\n<p>When asked about their dreams, these women report that more than anything they hope their children won\u2019t suffer as they have suffered.

Santa Lucia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The women of the Dalias Santa Lucia Group are from the municipality of Santa Lucia in the department of Solol\u00e1.  Santa Lucia is a small, primarily rural community, where the majority of residents work in agriculture or weaving traditional Guatemalan clothing.  The women in this group range in age from 19 to 53 years old and are quite modest and shy.  All of them have children and all of their children of school age are currently in school, which is quite an accomplishment and something they are all very proud of.  About half of them have had at least a little education, although none has completed more than the sixth grade.  Those who have not had any formal education cannot read or write, and sign all paperwork with a fingerprint.  \r\n\r\n<p>The women in this group have a variety of businesses:  three work in sewing clothing, one works in embroidery, one buys and sells clothing, one sells thread for embroidery, and one has a little store where she sells daily consumption items such as beans, noodles, rice and sugar.  This group has worked with Friendship Bridge for nearly four years and been very successful in paying back five loans.  They report that the loans have really helped them expand their businesses and they will be using this next loan to purchase more cloth and thread and more inventory so they have more to sell, and therefore potential for more income.  \r\n\r\n<p>When asked what they like most about working together in the Dalias group, they say that they are all neighbors and it\u2019s great to be able to work together to fight for a better life.  With their businesses and the help of loans, it\u2019s no longer just their husbands working, they are now able to work equally hard and contribute to their families\u2019 incomes.  These women dream of expanding their businesses and being able to provide good educations for their children so they can be successful in life.  Each loan they receive from Friendship Bridge and Kiva helps them get just a little bit closer to achieving these dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":177121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

is a humble family woman, whose most important motivation is her children.

Her father was a struggling farmer, who used to carry out this work in order to keep his family, and it is now up to Cirilia to keep her family of four children so that they can continue on the path of development.  Cirila purchases the forage wholesale and then sells it to her neighbors.  In this way she generates  revenue, which enables her to provide the necessities for her children.  So that Cirila can continue on this path, she is applying for a loan of $350.

Thi Bao, 35 years old, has 3 school-going children. Before joining the TYM Fund, she stayed at home to raise livestock and take care of the children, thus her family relied mainly on her husband's income. Therefore, they faced many difficulties. She joined the Fund in 1995 and borrowed loans to start a business. She used the first few loans to get used to doing business by selling fresh bamboo shoot. After 10 years of membership, she now has a small shop selling foodstuffs in the market. Besides managing the shop, she also works for various local processed-meat production companies so her family's income is very stable. Her husband works as a driver, earning 3,000,000VND (about 193USD) per month. Her children can all go to school. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in her food shop. Her family's monthly income is 7,000,000VND (about 451USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3o n\u0103m nay 35 tu\u1ed5i.

Nosir started his business at home, but made solid profits as time went by, so he decided to expand his business with the help of IMON. Now, his business is very profitable and generates the main income for his family. He gets up early and bakes the lepeshka and bread so that his customers have fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. All of the input materials, such as flour, salt, and yeast, he purchases wholesale at the local market. <p>\r\nOne of Nosir\u2019s dreams is to arrange the wedding of his dearest daughter, which is why he works extremely hard. With this purpose in mind, Nosir decided to expand his business, and now he is requesting a loan in the amount of $600 over a 12-month term. With the loan proceeds, Nosir plans to purchase additional flour and coal to bake the lepeshka. Nosir has already received a loan and thereby demonstrated that he is an honest client; this time, he once again promises to promptly repay the loan.

The loans accomplished many things, such as paying school fees for her children and grandchildren, supporting the health of her family and feeding the family.\r\n\r\nGiven this loan, Grace plans to construct a new pig pen, electrify the pig pen to give light to the pigs when they are about to deliver at night. She also plans to buy 10 piglets to add to the ones she already has, to prepare a packing space for her firewood, and to continue buying and splitting of wood. She promises to start repayment at the fourth month from the date of disbursement.  \r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she plans to expand her business, continue to pay school fees for her children and grandchildren, and take care of the health and feeding in the family.\r\n\r\nGrace prefers a loan from GHAPE because the means  of repayment is easier, the loan scheme is encouraging, the interest paid on GHAPE loans is relatively low as compared to other financial institution, and lastly, GHAPE does proper follow up with their clients to ensure the loan is manage judiciously."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":177366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy materials for new pig pen, and piglets and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

For the past three years, she has operated a profitable second-hand clothing business, purchasing high quality women\u2019s clothing from a large open-air market in central Kampala, and selling it to women in Kalerwe, a distant urban neighborhood.  Each month, she is able to make a profit of about 150,000\/= (Ugandan shillings, a little less than $100 US).  One of the things that makes business difficult is that the wards and town council want a lot of taxes from her on many different things.

Her profits have helped her to improve her crop farm, start rearing pigs, buy a plot of land, and lay the foundation for an addition to her family compound. \r\n\r\nFlorence now requests this loan to add to her various businesses.

in 1961, Mama Beatrice was married to the late Pa Peter Zongcho.  While in her marital home, she successfully gave birth to seven children, two of whom are still below the age of fifteen years. Before she was able to access business capital, she felt incapable of assisting her husband to care for their family. These circumstances motivated her to join GHAPE in 2002. Since then, she has received and repaid five loans, totaling $550, from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy yams and cassava seedlings for planting, and purchase fresh tomatoes and groundnuts in bulk for retail. She thinks her business will succeed because she already has a piece of land to cultivate and her many neighbors will provide a ready market for her fresh tomatoes and groundnuts. Moreover, she will help her neighbors, who previously had to trek long distances to acquire these basic commodities.       \r\n\r\nMama Beatrice plans to pay her loan in 24 months.

Selling food seasonings has been Koumba\u2019s specialty for the last 15 years. She started this business very early in her life like most of the women of her generation, who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to study. She has been making sales in the Darsalam I neighborhood where there isn\u2019t a market and thus competitors are fewer. Sales are made from home, where products are spread out on a big table in the middle of the family compound. Her customers are mostly women who make purchases every day. She has had a relationship with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution for the last four years and has borrowed six loans (four group loans and two individual loans) that she has successfully repaid. The current loan will be used to purchase seasonings and vegetables in bulk (baskets of tomatoes, chilies, peppers, a case of spaghetti, two bags of salt, etc.). She anticipates making an average profit of 60,000 Francs CFA per month that she will use toward her family\u2019s needs, to pay interest to Soro Yiriwaso, and to increase her capital. She plans to open a shop to sell seasonings in her neighborhood. \r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\nMadame  Koumba  Boit\u00e9 est m\u00e8re de 4 enfants (2 filles et 2 gar\u00e7ons), \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43 ans et  vit avec  son mari , sa co\u00e9pouse et leurs enfants dans une famille polygame  au quartier  Darsalam  I de la  Pr\u00e9fecture de Koutiala (R\u00e9gion de Sikasso).\r\nLa vente de condiments alimentaires est la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de Koumba depuis 15 ans.

is 62 years old and is raising 5 children. She buys and sells dried fruit in the central market of the city of Isfara. She mostly buys apricot kernels, splits them, and sells the nut within. The dried fruit market is divided into the buying and selling of apricots, their kernels, and nuts from the kernels. Many families in the Isfara District make their living by working in this sphere. Kibrohon is helped in this work by her oldest daughter. Early in the morning they leave for the neighboring markets to buy apricot kernels. They bring them home where during the day they they split them, using a special device. After sorting the nuts they divide them into bags and take them to the next market. Their profit goes to supporting the family and partly to expanding the business. Once she found out about Kiva, Kibrohon decided to apply for a loan to expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>
