Luego de unos a\u00f1os Ella instal\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a galera en el patio frontal de su vivienda para vender comidas y golosinas, y aunque es un buen negocio practicamente pasa de pie todo el dia asi que termina sumamente cansada. Carmen tambien se dedica a la venta de cosmeticos por catalogo, asi que mientras sus clientes esperan a que sus platillos esten listos, ella aprovecha y les muestra los catalogos. El prestamo que Carmen solicita lo necesita para comprar carnes, pollo, verduras, harina, maseca, refrescos, platos, cubiertos, entre otros. Con el apoyo del prestamo Carmen podra surtir su negocio, ya que no cuenta con mucho capital para hacerlo y espera que este le genere las suficientes ganancias para cubrir sus gastos familiares y tambien el pago de las cuotas, y para ahorrar un poco porque su meta es aperturar una cafeteria en el centro de la comunidad. Este es el primer credito que recibe do\u00f1a Carmen y se siente muy contenta porque podra mantener activo su negocio. ","en":"Do\u00f1a Carmen is a member of the February 15th Solidarity Group.  She is married and has three children.  Carmen and her family reside in the community of Chiripa in the Department of Colon.  She earns her livelihood by selling food.  Carmen started her business four years ago by helping out at a school event, which consisted of selling hamburgers.  As a result, she earned very good profits, so Carmen decided to stay in this business.  A few years later, she installed a small kitchen on the front patio of her house so that she could sell food and sweets.  Her business requires her to be on her feet all day, so she is tired when her work ends.  Carmen also sells cosmetics through catalogs.  While her customers wait for their dishes to be prepared, she takes advantage of this time to show them catalogs.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Carmen is requesting will be used to buy meat, chicken, vegetables, flour, cornmeal, soft drinks, plates, cutlery, and other supplies.  With the support of this loan, Carmen will be able to restock her business since she does not have much capital to invest.  She hopes that this will generate sufficient income to cover the family expenses and also complete her loan payments.  Carmen is also saving a little bit of money because her goal is to open a cafeteria in the middle of her community.  This is the first loan that Do\u00f1a Carmen has received and she is very pleased because it will help her business remain active.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":853381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat, chicken, vegetables, flour, cornmeal, soft drinks, plates, cutlery, and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tocoa, Colon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.683333 -86","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-28T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Osiris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Iracema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sixto Alcides ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307957,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784946,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-17T09:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589343,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-29T05:27:54Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":329156,"name":"Isaac Misael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Isaac tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad,  casado y padre de dos hijos, trabaja como guarda de seguridad desde hace nueve a\u00f1os, su esposa trabaja en servicios domesticos para lograr cubrir los gastos.\nComo objetivo de ambos ha sido la construccion de su peque\u00f1a casa, ya que es hecha de zinc, e insegura, pero por diversas dificultades no habian podido avanzar, ya que todo esta caro.

He is a small-scale farmer of cassava and malanga (a native tuber).  He is married and has three children.  He lives together with his family in the community of La Concepcion, in the town of Patuca.  He started out growing cassava and malanga with a little money that he earned working as a laborer.  He managed to sow half a 'manzana' (one 'manzana' = 1.68 acres) of land and he obtained good results so he left his work as a laborer and started working full time on his farming.  His work day starts at 6.00am and ends at midday.  From time to time his children help him with some light tasks as they are still young.  His wife also does this but she mainly does the household chores.\r\n\r\nYonis' advantage is that the crops that he grows are part of people's daily diet and so they are easy to sell.  His disadvantage is that he doesn't have enough money to increase his growing area.  Yonis needs this loan to buy urea, molasses and fungicides, and also to pay laborers to prepare his land for sowing.  His goal is to apply technology to his farming so that he can become a big producer, provide his family with better living conditions and keep his children in school so that they can become professionals.\r\n\r\nYonis has been working with FAMA for three loan cycles and he has repaid his loans punctually.

However, he feels he has an advantage in that coffee is a very marketable product and once it is harvested he can sell it quickly. He is requesting this loan to buy weed killer, fertilizer and to pay a labor force to clear the land.

Together they live in El Guineo neighborhood #2 in Patuca municipality.\r\n\r\nDomingo is not a native of Patuca. He arrived here with practically no money in his pocket and with scarcely enough to buy a small piece a land and build a small hut on it to live in. Then he looked for work as a day laborer and little by little he earned enough to buy coffee plants and thereby begin cultivating his own plot of land. Now Domingo has his own crop and fortunately it is going well because as soon as he harvests his coffee he sells it quickly.  He is requesting a loan to buy molasses, fertilizer and to pay a labor force to clear his land for cultivation.  This loan will help him with his coffee production and also to earn a small profit so he can continue to cover his household expenses as well as the medical costs for one of his children who has leukemia. Although these medical costs are high, his wife and he will never stop fighting to prevent their son from succumbing to this disease.\r\n\r\nDomingo\u2019s goal is to become a large scale coffee producer and to provide a better life for his family, especially for his ill son. This is his first loan from FAMA and he is confident that with God\u2019s help he will make his payments on time so that the organization will continue to support him with more loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":853366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy molasses, fertilizer and pay his labor force.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domingo Gusman ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7051.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T00:13:27Z","paid_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":329193,"name":"Alfonso Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Alfonso Alejandro, es soltero, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, curso los estudios de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, se dedica a la artesan\u00eda, inicio este negocio gracias a su padres que lo apoyaron y hasta el momento lleva 2 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nDecide solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que le servir\u00e1 para comprar hilo de diferentes colores y clase y un telar para tejedur\u00eda, ya que quiere tener su negocio propio y contar con su propio telar, para mejorar su condici\u00f3n de vida y la de sus padres.\n","en":"Alfonso Alejandro is a 23 year old, single young man.

However, it is now very necessary for her to improve the infrastructure of the cowshed, because she is coming up to the winter season, and this poses many difficulties if she is to keep the cowshed clean.  It is for this reason that she decided to look for financing options that will allow her to put her plans into practice, and so she decided to work with MFP as she saw it was a good option with repayments that were within her reach.  \r\n\r\nWith the money that she is receiving, she will buy sand and bags of cement.

He began his business because he realized that he would make huge profits taking advantage of the fact that there was no such a business in his community. \r\n\r\nMusa started by selling items in a small wooden box, moved to a kiosk and now a container which he has converted to a shop and bar. Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about 1,050,000 Leones (SLL) every month from this business.

Because she\u2019d like to eventually open a butcher shop she recently used some savings from her sales to buy a slicer, a grinder and a car that she leases out for 20 soles a day.

She has been doing this for 21 years and she considers the most difficult thing about her job  to be working with laborers in different fields with different crops.  For this reason she needs money so she can improve her crops.  Now, over time, she wants to buy new land so she can increase her production.  She knows that she will be able to achieve this as she is a hard-working, capable woman.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Alianza al progreso\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP.  She is certain that she will be able to make all of her payments on time since the members of her communal bank have taught her to be responsible.  Upon receiving her support Teresa will buy natural fertilizers to spread on her crops as well as 2 thousand coffee seedlings.

They have been married for 25 years and are the parents of 3 children: their daughter, 24, is married, their daughter, 22, is a single mother with a child and their youngest, a son, is 17 and attends high school. Three years ago, through a government social housing program called Pie de Casa, Ana and her husband acquired a house that they have been expanding little by little. When the house was given to them it consisted of only one small room [approximately 270 sq. feet] with space to build. They have been improving this house with their own savings. Their family is growing and they need more space. With their own savings, they started putting in the foundation of a room with the dream some day of finishing their home so that each family member would have his or her own space. They need this loan to erect the walls of  a room.

He lives in Ivano-Frankivsk in Western Ukraine and works as a taxi driver in the local transport service. He offers not only local   transportation services in his town but also long-distance transfers throughout the Ukraine. Volodymyr has been working in this business for seven years. His gross monthly income is 7,000 UAH.\r\n\r\nVolodymyr plans to use his loan of 5,000 in order to buy equipment for compressed natural gas and make alterations to his car allowing it to run on CNG, which will substantially decrease his fuel expenses. This business is the main source of income for the client\u2019s family. Before joining the transportation service, Volodymyr used to work in the state security service, but then, after his wife gave birth to a daughter, he left that employment and started working as a taxi driver. Volodymyr's goals are to provide for his daughter\u2019s education and eventually to purchase a newer car.\r\nNote: loan description is in

Oksana lives and works in Drogobych, Western Ukraine. She has two shops where she sells fruit and vegetables. Her products are always fresh and sold for a good price, so many regular customers shop with her, even coming from other parts of the city. Oksana began her business when she was left without a job fourteen years ago. She started when she and her husband brought vegetables and fruit in an old car directly to houses and sold them from their car.  After a while, she bought one kiosk and then another. At present, Oksana's goods are valued at 20,000 hryvnia. \r\n\r\nOksana plans to use a Kiva loan for 12,000 hryvnia to finish building another kiosk. Oksana has the desire to work and the ability to conduct business. She is an entrepreneur who can work to expand her business through her own effort and hard work. In her case, it helps the whole family. In the near future Oksana would like to expand her business and open additional shops. With her profit, Oksana plans to provide her children with the opportunity to get a decent education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":854379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is happily married to her husband Johan and they have four beautiful children.  Her family lives in their own home in the city of San Ram\u00f3n, which is located in the central Peruvian jungle.  Every Friday during the early morning hours, she sets up a tent in front of the public toilets that are located in a strategic area of the fair that takes place in her city.  In this space, Lucia sells undergarments, polo shirts, and trousers since she is also in charge of sanitation.  She has operated this business for three years with the help of her children.  What she enjoys most is getting to know new customers and recommending clothes for them according to size and age.  However, she admits that sometimes she feels disappointed when she does not sell much.  Nonetheless she continues to press forward and is always able to sell something without losing any of her investment.  For this reason, she considers her business activities to be profitable since they allow her to live comfortably because of the profits they generate.  In the future, she hopes to increase the quantity of merchandise in her inventory because she wants to have a store in a stable place.

He also raises sheep and fattens them for a market in the city.  The market is 2 hours away but he uses the trip to sell his potato crop, as well.  He owns 2 burros that he uses to carry the heavy bags of potatoes he collects.  He's thinking now of opening a store, with help from his community bank, to sell clothing in a shop in the town.

Martina finds the business profitable.  Thanks to her small restaurant she has made some repairs to her house, and she and her family also eat there.  The problems that Martina has to deal with include the water, which is only available during certain hours and delays the preparation of her food, and the high cost of vegetables and other products.  Martina needs this loan to buy products for her restaurant at wholesale.  In addition, she will use the loan to make some changes to her restaurant to make it more attractive.

They have a daughter, Cecilia, whom they are caring for and raising in the native community of Alianza. Since childhood, his parents taught him everything he had to know about farming and little by little he took over caring for his parents' crops. Now he has extensive cropland- 4 agricultural plots where he grows coffee, avocados and plantains. He sells them in the market of the city of La Merced, where he goes frequently. He is a locksmith in a welding shop where he makes extra money thanks to his abilities; he is one of the best in the area. But what he likes the best is the time he spends working the land and growing his product. This is the activity that feeds his family. He has 10 years experience and he considers the most difficult thing is protecting his products from pests. He really wants to buy a car to transport his products and thus lower his costs. He belongs to the \u201cAlianza al progreso\u201d [Alliance for Progress] community bank and this is his fourth loan with MFP. He has always made his payments on time, since he is grateful for the support he has received. Upon receiving your support, he will invest the money he has asked for in paying laborers to help him plant corn and plantains, which he will do very soon.

He is a humble man who 6 years ago started a family with Erika, his wife. They have 2 children whom they are raising in their own home located in the community of San Juan. This hardworking farmer spends his time growing potatoes, peas and beans on his own land and on rented land. He rents more productive land sometimes for more production. What he likes the most about his job is being able to care for his crops trimming, fertilizer, and improving the quality of the food in the ripening process. He has 18 years experience in the farming profession and he feels very good about that. He also started a business buying and selling seeds. He takes them  to the city of Arequipa, where he makes good profit because that type of seed isn't produced in that area of the Peruvian coast. Now he is planning on improving the quality of his crops and growing his business, since that is what he likes the most. This is his eighth loan with MFP, where he hopes to have your cooperation to continue with his goals. He also promises to once more make his payments on time. Two years ago, Edgar bought his own house. That is why, if he receives your support, he will invest the money he has asked for in repairing the windows, putting in a floor, changing the doors and improving the roof.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":854477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to repair windows, change doors and install a roof.

She makes various types of breads and biscuits, her specialty. She has been a baker for 10 years and she learned the trade from her father, and to date they work together. She states that following her business success she has been able to expand it even more, adding the sale of butter, cheese, and sausages, to be enjoyed with any type of bread. And given these additions her sales have increased. Throughout all this time she has been able to cover the household expenses, as well as her son's and her own education. In her quest for progress, she is learning to be a primary school teacher at an institution in her locality, and she is almost finished. What she most enjoys about her work is delivering breads and decorating cakes for special occasions. She also likes the Christmas season when she bakes turkeys. In the future she's thinking about studying to be a chocolatier and a pastry chef to improve her cakes and snacks. This will help her sales be more constant and secure.

Together with her husband they semiannually plant corn, sweet corn, and gladiolas.  They sell them at the markets in Tarma and La Merced, which is where they get the best prices.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is taking care of the crops so that they are free of pest infestations.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  She considers the most difficult part to be taking her crops to the markets where she sells them.  The sacks she takes are very heavy.\r\n\r\nLater she hopes to improve her products and get better prices.  She is sure that she will do it.  Her husband started a business of buying and selling diverse products in the capital of the country.  He gets good prices there.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay Communal Bank.  This is her ninth loan with MFP, where she has benefitted in her growth as a farmer.  Therefore, she pledges to be punctual with her payments.  Upon receiving your support Marcela will use the requested loan to buy various sacks of natural fertilizers to scatter on her next corn crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":854550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy various sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-29T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T00:16:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":329438,"name":"Ellen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ellen, de 46 a\u00f1os, es una mujer siempre sonriente, emprendedora y con ganas de salir adelante y progresar.

Before long she had a son and later on two daughters. At that time, Wilmalyn\u2019s husband started raising sheep, but this work was not particularly profitable. However, steady income was necessary to support the growing family. And this is how, lacking formal education and practical knowledge, Wilmalyn decided to go into retail.\r\n\r\nLike many in a similar situation, Wilmalyn started by selling at the local market. With three children to feed and without a reliable source of income, working as a vendor was the only opportunity to have earnings. After much effort, her first year of entrepreneurship turned out to be successful. The starting capital amounted to 4,000 PHP and already after the first year of work, Wilmalyn was able to increase her investment.\r\n\r\nAfter selling food items in their village for five years, Wilmalyn opened a small grocery store in front of their home.

She has 3 children, and they live in their own house located in the district of Pichari. Martha is a very hard-working woman who has done agricultural work since she was very young; she learned this work from her parents. One year ago, she left this profession to dedicate herself to caring for children in a \"wawa wasi\" (child care center) in her community. This work is part of a government program which provides care for the benefit of people who have babies and cannot normally work because they do not have anyone to care for their small children. Thus, Martha provides her services caring for babies, because she is very patient and dedicated to them. She feels happy doing this work, which in turn allows her to earn a salary so she can cover her household expenses. In the near future, she would like to open a grocery store. This is her second loan with  MFP, and Martha once again pledges to make her payments on time. \n\nThis is her second loan, and she stands by her commitment to make her payments on time.
