Bahan baku gula merah dicari oleh suaminya di pohon kelapa di kebunnya. Dalam sehari Nengah Ngalis bisa memproduksi 5 sampai 8 kg gula merah yang harga per kilonya saat ini mencapai Rp. 6.000.- jadi dalam sehari pendapatannya sekitar Rp 40.000.- sampai Rp. 50.000.- Gula hasil produksinya langsung diserahkan kepasar yang sudah menjadi langanan tetapnya. Kini pelanggan yang dimilikinya semakin banyak dipasar sehingga Nengah Ngalis membutuhkan tambahan modal usaha sebesar Rp. 5.000.000.- untuk memperbesar usahanya dengan cara membeli gula merah hasil buatan tetangganya kemudian menjualnya kembali dipasar yang sudah menjadi langganannya. Dengan harapan bahwa penghasilan yang diperolehnya bisa meningkat untuk mencukupi kebutuhan hidup

Burhonjon is 41 years old. He is married with three children. \r\n\r\nBurhonjon inherited his business and has already been involved in the confectionary business for 32 years.  He specialises in producing confectionary such as lump sugar, and the national sweets known as \u201cnabot\u201d which is made of sugar syrop and cooked in a huge cauldron for several hours and then left for hardening up to 2 weeks. People say it is very healthy. This business is the main source of income for Burhonjon\u2019s family and provides him with a stable business in which to support his family.\r\n\r\nBurhinjon has been working with IMON since 2005.

C. is a driver by profession and currently works as a security guard at the \u201cSafariyon\u201d market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  He has a big family: 5 children, a wife and elderly parents.  Previously he drove trolleys and buses, but now that public transport no longer operates and taxis are the main mode of transportation, he has been working as a security guard for 7 years.  Safarbek\u2019s job involves guarding the products that are for sale.  He gets his salary from the market administration.  <p>\r\n\r\nSafarbek heard about MicroInvest and decided to ask for a loan to repair his house (this winter his roof leaked and a wall fell over, so he wants to rebuild everything).  He has received good recommendations and has good character, which led the credit committee to place his loan on the KIVA site.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

It is the Vietnamese New Year which is based on the Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar. The name T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n is Sino-Vietnamese for Feast of the First Morning, derived from the H\u00e1n n\u00f4m characters \u7bc0\u5143\u65e6. In modern Chinese, the characters for Nguy\u00ean \u00d0\u00e1n (\u5143\u65e6) have evolved to refer to New Year in the Gregorian calendar, that is, January 1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/> \r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb V., 46 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2003.

Her other three children already have a job and move out.  Besides farming on a couple of perches of rice-field, her family main job is breeding animals.  With the advantage of having quite a lot of land, Mrs. T. breeds 200 ducks.  This brings her a steady income.  Each day she gets around 100 duck eggs.  She then brings these eggs to sell in the market and earn 6-8 USD.  She uses this money to repay her loan quickly and still has enough left for her daily expenses.  Besides, she also breeds 4-5 pigs.  Because of the increase in the animals leading to larger demand on feedings for them, Mrs. T. wants to borrow 575 USD to buy food for her ducks and pigs.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>   \r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Ph\u1ea1m Th\u1ecb Th\u00e0nh, 56 tu\u1ed5i, \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con \u00fat \u0111ang h\u1ecdc n\u0103m cu\u1ed1i ph\u1ed5 th\u00f4ng. 3 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con l\u1edbn \u0111\u1ec1u tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh, c\u00f3 vi\u1ec7c l\u00e0m v\u00e0 \u0111\u00e3 ra \u1edf ri\u00eang.

Usually, her husband and son will go fishing offshore, and she and her daughter will stay at home to sell the fish. Her children are all grown-up and become main workers of the house. Her income from fishing and fish mongering is pretty decent. However, her business will run better if she has better tools. She talked to her family and decided to borrow 400 USD to buy more fishing tools so that her fishing business will be more effective.

In spite of the difficulties of life that an indigenous woman lives day to day, these ladies have a smile stamped on their faces that would encourage anyone to forge ahead. The ladies are a very solid and serious group, considering that they have only been together for two cycles. This is due largely to the fact that that they all live together in the same community: the San Gregorio neighborhood. In this neighborhood they live together everyday, organizing celebrations, religious events, birthdays, and charitable giving to support their neediest neighbors.<p> The \u201cTrabajadoras Tolim\u00e1n\u201d are also a relatively homogeneous group, in that all of the women are requesting almost the same loan, between $260.00 and $390.00. This reflects the fact that the clients are advancing at an even pace in respect to entrepreneurial development.<p> The majority of the women have small grocery stores where they sell kitchen items and clearing products, among other products. Others have businesses buying and selling corn, beans, and coffee. It is important to explain that coffee is harvested in the Atitl\u00e1n region of Guatemala during the month of January; therefore, the coffee business is at its peak right now. Another group of them weaves <i>huipiles<\/i>, the traditional clothing for Guatemalan women, and dresses, skirts, and belts.<p> The ladies are going to use the loan to buy products for the home, such as: eggs, sugar, salt, soap, detergent, etc. Others will use it to buy corn, beans, and coffee in bulk in the fields where they are harvested, so that they can later sell them back in their communities. The rest will use the loan to buy threads and fabric to make their weavings.<p> Many of the women dream of providing the best for their children and this is a big challenge. Among them is a widow who is the mother of ten children. She told me that she was only able to help her children get ahead in life through working very hard everyday. Her story really makes an impact.<p> It is imperative that these women recieve their next loan so that their business can succeed.

Las se\u00f1oras conforman un grupo consolidado y muy serio, teniendo en cuenta que s\u00f3lo han estado juntas dos ciclos. Esto se debe en mayor parte, a que todas viven en la misma comunidad: la colonia San Gregorio. En esta colonia ellas conviven diariamente organizando fiestas, eventos religiosos, cumplea\u00f1os, festividades y peque\u00f1as colectas para apoyar a los vecinos m\u00e1s necesitados. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Trabajadoras Tolim\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n son un grupo relativamente homog\u00e9neo, ya que todas las se\u00f1oras est\u00e1n pidiendo casi el mismo pr\u00e9stamo entre US$260 y US$390. Esto refleja que las clientas est\u00e1n avanzando a un ritmo parejo en lo que respecta desarrollo empresarial. \r\n\r\n<P>La gran mayor\u00eda de se\u00f1oras ya tienen una tienda de consumo diario, donde ellas venden art\u00edculos de cocina, de limpieza, entre otros productos.

Es importante destacar que durante el mes de enero el caf\u00e9 es cosechado en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n en Guatemala, por ende el negocio cafetero est\u00e1 en auge en estos momentos. Mientras que otro grupo trabaja tejiendo huipiles, trajes tradicionales Guatemalatecos para las mujeres, cortes o faldas y fajas. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos para la casa como: huevos, az\u00facar, sal, jab\u00f3n, detergente, etc. Otras van a utilizarlo para comprar ma\u00edz, fr\u00edjol y caf\u00e9 al por mayor en los campos de cosecha, para luego revenderlo en sus comunidades. Mientras que el resto lo va a utilizar para comprar hilos y telas para elaborar sus tejidos. \r\n\r\n<P>Muchas de estas se\u00f1oras sue\u00f1an con brindar lo mejor a sus hijos y eso es un gran reto.

The members of Las Sirenas meet every three weeks with a representative of Friendship Bridge, beneath an avocado tree, to protect themselves from the sun. The image really is touching because, despite the fact that they don\u2019t have the necessary infrastructure, the ladies fulfill their obligations as best they can, and with a smile on their faces. <p> The clients that make up the group are from Cerro de Oro, an area in the Atitl\u00e1n region where most of the habitants are Tzu\u2019tujil Maya, and that is widely recognized for beautiful weavings. The eighteen members are successful weavers of <i>huipiles<\/i> (a type of decorated blouse), the traditional dress of Guatemala, belts, and skirts, among other types of clothing.<p> he success of these clients is reflected in the fact that more than half of them have one or more people weaving for them. One of the ladies has up to five people weaving for her during the periods of greatest demand. The other the ladies all work for themselves. Additionally, some of them have parallel businesses, such as the selling fish and crab in the market, raising animals, or a small grocery store.<p> These entrepreneurial achievements are impressive, given that previously these same ladies only worked as laborers for a fabric factory. Now you could say that many of them are the owners of their destinies. Due to the resounding success of their businesses and to the money generated, they are no longer exposed to the obstacles that life can present.<p> The clients will use their loan mostly to buy threads in different colors for making their weavings. They will also use it to buy products for their stores and animals to raise.<p> The ladies associate their happiness with the prosperity of their future generations. They dream of a better future for their children. In other words, they hope that their children will be able to eat what they themselves couldn\u2019t and that they will finish high school, which they themselves were never able to attend. Others said they would like to build a house. One client made the others think when she said that she would like to buy a car for work and, why not, to drive around for fun in her free time. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b><P>El banco comunal Las Sirenas est\u00e1 conformado por un grupo de mujeres muy alegres. Las Sirenas se juntan cada tres semanas debajo de un \u00e1rbol de aguacate durante sus reuniones, con la representante de Friendship Bridge, para que las proteja del sol. La imagen es realmente tierna, ya que, a pesar de que ellas no tienen la infraestructura necesaria, las se\u00f1oras cumplen con sus compromisos de la mejor manera, con una sonrisa en la cara. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas que conforman el grupo provienen de Cerro de Oro, un \u00e1rea habitada mayormente por los Mayas Tzu\u00b4tujiles, donde el tejido es muy reconocido en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n por su belleza. Las diez y ocho integrantes son tejedoras exitosas de huipiles, traje tradicional de Guatemala, fajas, faldas entre otras prendas de ropa. \r\n\r\n<P>El \u00e9xito de estas clientas se refleja en que m\u00e1s de la mitad tienen una o m\u00e1s personas tejiendo para ellas. Una de las se\u00f1oras tiene hasta cinco artesanas tejiendo para ella durante las \u00e9pocas de mayor demanda. El resto de se\u00f1oras trabajan para si mismas. Adem\u00e1s, algunas clientas tienen un negocio paralelo como la venta de pescados y cangrejos en el mercado, crianza de animales y tienen una tienda de consumo diario. \r\n\r\n<P>Este logro empresarial es impresionante, debido a que antes estas mismas se\u00f1oras solo trabajaban como mano de obra para una comercializadora de tejidos. Ahora se puede decir que muchas de ellas son las due\u00f1as de sus destinos. Debido al \u00e9xito rotundo de sus negocios y al dinero generado, ellas ya no est\u00e1n tan expuestas a las trabas que le puede presentar la vida. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo principalmente para comprar hilos de distintos colores para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus tejidos. Tambi\u00e9n, lo van a utilizar para comprar productos para sus tiendas y animales para su respectiva crianza. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras asocian su felicidad con la prosperidad de sus futuras generaciones. Ellas sue\u00f1an con un futuro mejor para sus hijos. En otras palabras, que sus hijos puedan comer lo que ellas no pudieron y que terminen el colegio que ellas nunca pudieron asistir. Otras dijeron que les gustar\u00eda construir una casita. Mientras que una clienta despert\u00f3 la conciencia del grupo al decir que a ella le gustar\u00eda comprar un carro para trabajar y porque no para pasear en sus ratos libres."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":122977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy a variety of colored threads for making thier weavings;

For example, Mar\u00eda C. is going use her loan to buy four pigs and twenty chickens. The ladies feel this is what is most advisable for them and that this is what is in highest demand in the market.<p> Las Dalias is a group that, through the years, has formed an unbeatable friendship. One lady commented that one of the many benefits of working in the methodology of communal banks is that all the participants know each other like family.

The name \u201cPigy Lestari\u201d (Eternal Pigy) was finally selected as the name of the group with 11 members, with Ni Komang Ratiani as the leader.  After the group Pigy Lestari was formed the members submit a start-up loan application with DINARI, whether for capital funding or veterinary assistance.  From each funding they attained, will be used to purchase piglets, mother pig and also feed and supplies.  Income from the sale varies depending on market situation.  Gain is usually greater during religious celebrations because demand for pork is high thus increasing the price of pork.  From 1 piglet alone, the net gain is approximately Rp 400.000, - after rearing for 6 months.  Each gain will be use to supplement the families financial needs.

Dari setiap modal yang mereka peroleh, itu dipakai untuk membeli bibit penggemukan, penginduk dan juga stok pakan untuk ternak mereka. Hasil penjualan yang biasa mereka peroleh cukup bervariasi berdasarkan situasi pasar. Keuntungan tertinggi bisa mereka peroleh menjelang hari-hari besar agama karena biasanya kebutuhan akan daging babi cukup banyak sehingga hargapun juga meningkat. Dari satu ekor penggemukan saja keuntungan bersih yang bisa diperoleh sekitar Rp  400.000,- setelah dipelihara selama 6 bulan. Dari setiap keuntungan yang diperoleh ini mereka pergunakan untuk membantu mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga.

was born in 1985, is single and lives with her parents. Her family is of average means. Her parents do not have money to  pay for higher education, so after high school Parvina and her elder sister started working at a bakery that made pirozhki - baked  or fried pastries\/patties with meat or vegetable filling.  There were three other young women working at the  bakery. \r\n\r\n<p> Parvina worked at the bakery  from 2002 to 2005. During this time she became very good at making pirozhki and decided to open up her own business. For the last three years she has successfully run such a business. She and her sister make the dough, her younger brother bakes and then sells the pirozhki. Her food stand is located in the 'Safariyon' Market  and is definitely one of the well known ones.\r\n\r\n<p>Parvina joined  MLF MicroInvest  in early 2007 and has had good credit standing. When she found out about the Kiva partnership, she requested a loan to buy 4 sacks of flour, 50 liters of cooking oil, 40 kilograms of meat and 6 sacks of potatoes for the filling. She would like to use any remaining funds  to buy fire wood to fry the pirozhki because in winter the market does not have any electricity during the day.  Parvina is very hopeful about getting a Kiva loan and extends her thanks in advance for the help.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":123177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buying  ingredients & heating supplies for  the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-02-12T18:05:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-26T22:38:49Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-03-12T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156207,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-04-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180562,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208145,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":236103,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264889,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":347,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":293822,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-02-12T22:38:49Z","paid_date":"2008-08-12T09:08:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":34519,"name":"Norm","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Norm S., 37, is married with four children and lives with his wife in Batambong province, Cambodia.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":123257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.

Besides general curative services and check-ups, her facility has a pharmacy, an x-ray machine, a laboratory, and maternal and child health services. Dr. B. attributes her success to hard work, perseverance, and assistance from KMET through three previous loans that have allowed her to expand the clinic, increase the number of services it offers, and improve the quality of care it provides. Dr. B. also carries a very good reputation from her many years of good work in Kisumu. Her practice continues to grow as she attracts more corporate clients as well as private patients.
