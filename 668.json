15 years ago he launched his cattle raising business with a starting capital of 10,000 KGS. Tireless work and dedication   allowed him to grow his business, which now brings him a monthly income of 20,000 KGS. The family also started farming and gardening, and the income proved a good help in paying for their children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop his business further, Amanaly turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS in order to buy dairy cows. The revenues from selling dairy products will allow Amanaly to pay for the wedding of his younger son Asan. In the future, Amanaly plans to create his own farm, where his son will be his main assistant.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1037.01,"image":{"id":867426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kokzhar village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-08T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amanaly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7444},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7463},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":7644},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":7828},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8017},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8211},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8410},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8613},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8821},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9034},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9253},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9262}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":165.63,"local_amount":7444,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":7456.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751289,"comment":null},{"amount":166.05,"local_amount":7463,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7475.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555513,"comment":null},{"amount":170.08,"local_amount":7644,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7657.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514676,"comment":null},{"amount":174.17,"local_amount":7828,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7841.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722480,"comment":null},{"amount":178.38,"local_amount":8017,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8030.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125413,"comment":null},{"amount":182.7,"local_amount":8211,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8225.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T03:18:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":334690,"name":"Dove Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephat, who is in his early 30's, is the married father of three children, one of whom attends school.

A Motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that motivates borrowers with good credit ratings who pay back their loans smoothly to receive half the amount of the existing loan before their original loan term has ended.

IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He works in this business alone, as his wife is a homemaker.  He has two children, and his oldest son left to work in Russia.  The youngest son is also involved in transportation services and also sometimes helps his father.  This is the second time Rauf is requesting a loan from Imon International; he has a good reputation and credit history.  Previous loan helped him to expand his business and maximize his profit.  Rauf is requesting a loan in the sum of $2000 for the purchase of a new car with the goal of expanding his business.

for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He tries to ensure that his children grow up to become educated and good people, and that they could work in good companies and opened their own businesses.  Rahimchon is involved in repairing and selling cars.  He buys cars first-hand and then sells them at a more profitable price.  He repairs and paints cars himself, and this allows him to reduce car repair expenses.  His brothers help him.  He started his business one year ago with small car repairs and now owns a private repair shop in the local town.  Rahimchon wants to obtain a loan in the sum of $3000 for the purchase of a car.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two months ago Juana had the opportunity to start a business of her own selling cheese and cream in her community since the community has no stores selling basic foodstuffs.  Juana rises at 4am to go buy the cheese she sells.  To get to the road where she catches the bus she has to hike down a rocky hill, cross a river and climb another hill.  There is no bridge spanning the river and the trek takes her about 20 minutes.  She reaches her supplier at 5am and buys 30 pounds of cheese that she transports back home by bus.  Once at home, Juana divides up the cheese into one-pound portions and packs them in individual bags.  To sell the cheese and cream, Juana leaves home at 8am and spends the entire day going from community to community on foot to sell her products.  It takes her three days to sell the 30 pounds of cheese that she buys.

From this business, she is able to earn about P1,500 a month. She is grateful that her income allows her to help sustain the financial needs of her children and their daily needs. \r\n\r\nShe would like to increase her income because the profit she generates from her store is not enough, especially when there are immediate costs associated with the family's corn farming business. For this reason, she is requesting a loan amount of P14,000 in order to allow her to stock groceries for her retail business, such as soft drinks, assorted biscuits, canned goods, milk, and sugar.
