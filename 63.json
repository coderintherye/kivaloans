In later rounds, she always qualified for maximum loans. In 2001, feeling that she has good cooking skills, she decided to take out a loan to open a restaurant right in her house. Her house location is easily accessible, right on route #2 at the intersection with the entrance to the airport. Her husband is a bus driver so he has a lot of contacts who would become her customers. The food served at the restaurant is delicious so it's no coincidence that her restaurant is busy. Her revenue is around 200 USD a month. This time she's requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy food & drinks, to expand her restaurant to better serve her customers.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nD\u00e1ng ng\u01b0\u1eddi nh\u1ecf nh\u1eafn, n\u1ee5 c\u01b0\u1eddi th\u00e2n thi\u1ec7n \u0111\u00f3 ch\u00ednh l\u00e0 \u1ea5n t\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean khi g\u1eb7p ch\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Th\u1eafng, 48 tu\u1ed5i, b\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 qu\u00e1n b\u00e1n h\u00e0ng \u0103n s\u00e1ng, th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean c\u1ee5m 39 Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng x\u00e3 Ph\u00fa Minh.

After 4 years with TYM, in 2000 she borrowed some money plus all her savings, they have built a 4 room house. In April 2007, they have built a 3 room extension to the house to serve as storage. This time she is requesting a loan 0f 650 USD to buy pigs for breeding and 300 chicks to raise, in time for the Tet holidays (new year, in Feb). They have a piece of land (2\/10 acre) for vegetable cultivation. Their production is enough to satisfy the demand of the whole S\u00f3c S\u01a1n district. Her husband and 3 children still work in construction to contribute to the family revenue. The family income is 300 USD a month \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thu\u1eadn, 55 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1996 l\u00fac chi nh\u00e1nh b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u tri\u1ec3n khai ho\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ed9ng v\u1ec1 x\u00e3 T\u00e2n Minh.

She is 55 years old, a member of TYM since 1995 in the T\u00e2n Minh village. Her success today is due to hard work and determination. She started with a loan of 20 USD which was used to raise chickens thus supplying food to her family. She also brewed rice wine. The next year, due to the successful sales of her batch of chickens, she was confident enough to take out a loan to buy 200 chickens. In 2006, she received a loan of 625 USD which was used to expand her operation, buidimg new cages for her chickens. Today, she has 250 egg laying chickens, 1300 for meat. Her revenue is 300 USD a month. Ms D\u00e2n  is very happy about her success and she hopes to be able to expand her operation again. This time she is requesting a loan of 950 USD to buy chicken feed, getting ready for the new year rush. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\n\"N\u1ebfu ai c\u00f3 nhu c\u1ea7u v\u1ec1 tr\u1ee9ng g\u00e0, h\u00e3y \u0111\u1ebfn nh\u00e0 ch\u1ecb D\u00e2n \u1edf x\u00e3 T\u00e2n Minh.

She began her business with a small inventory, slowly increasing her turnover. After a while, Mavluda was able to save money and opened her own shop. In 2003, she rented a stall (in the picture). Currently, she has wide range of products: baked goods, which she purchases in the local bakeries and confectioners shops as well as soft drinks and juices from local manufacturers. The rest of her goods she purchases at local wholesale markets. Her inventory is worth $1000 and she is applying to KIVA with a request for a loan of $1200 (5000 Somoni) for 6 months for the purchase of her next batch of products. <p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from

She sells clothing and shoes in open-air markets and to her friends and family.

He owns a factory where he makes musical instruments like guitars, mandolins, and charangos (a small stringed instrument similar to a ukelele).

The business stability and income increase helped him to return in time the previous loan. Mr. Otajonov M. is experienced in business (about 10 years) and has the appropriate knowledge in livestock because he he has worked with  bovine animals from the early years. He helped his father on the farm as the stock keeper and further in the livestock raising and selling. It was the family business.

This is why Mrs. H.'s family still has a lot of difficulties.  The quality of life increases significantly when she pioneered to change from the original method of farming to the VAC method (VAC stands for farming\/gardening, fishing, and breeding animals).  The first days were not easy, but Mrs. H. is still patient and firmly believe on her chosen project.  With diligence and patience, after all those years, she now has 1 acre of land to  use the VAC method, and this project continues to reward her a steady income.

Hasil yang didapat oleh petani sangat dipengaruhi oleh pemilihan bibit padi yang bukan merupakan jenis unggul. Untuk jenis padi unggul harganya relatif lebih mahal dari jenis lokal, namun mampu menghasilkan lebih banyak dan lebih tahan terhadap penyakit. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, I Wayan Sampun berencana membeli bibit padi unggul sehingga bisa menghasilkan lebih banyak dan lebih baik. Biaya perawatan tanaman bisa ditekan karena kwalitas bibit unggul yang tahan penyakit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":115313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Jos\u00e9 is retired from the Mozambican Armed Forces.  He contributed his youth so that the country could consolidate the victories gained with Independence in a climate of peace and harmony among Mozambicans.  In this process of civil war that occurred in the country, he lost a leg, making him disabled.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nDespite this, Jos\u00e9 didn't lose heart, neither did he let himself become depressed, and much less consider himself disabled.  To the contrary--he rolled up his sleeves and went to fight.  The fight to secure daily bread for his family.  Because his disability pension that he gets from the Ministry of Defense isn't sufficient to sustain his family, he decided to enroll in the FDM credit program to be able to benefit from a loan.  This is how he came to buy clothing in Maputo and sell them in one of the markets in the city of Xai-Xai.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, his wife, not contenting herself with a disabled husband, robbed him of some of his goods and left him and the children, still young.  This was two years ago.  At the moment, Jos\u00e9 isn't thinking of finding another wife.  He says he has strength to raise the children alone.  Still, it's possible in the medium-term future that he'll consider finding a companion.  But he would be really careful to choose the one that would become his future wife and mother of his children, to not fall into the same trap he fell into the first time.  But despite this, Jos\u00e9 is convinced that life shouldn't stop, that the only path is forward.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe travels twice a month to Maputo in order to buy clothes and sandals for his stall.  On the first trip he bought clothing worth 3000 meticais, and on the second trip, clothing worth 1500, as it was to replenish stock.  In the future, if the business goes well, he's thinking of improving his home using conventional building materials, as it is currently made of wood and stucco.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nJose Alberto M., nao casou oficialmente, mas vivia com uma mulher com quem teve 3 filhos. Jose e desmobilizado das Forcas Armadas de Mocambique. Ele contribuiu com a sua juventude para que o Pais pudesse consolidar as conquistas alcancadas com a Independencia num clima de paz e harmonia entre os Mocambicanos. Nesse processo de guerra civil que gracou o Pais ele ficou sem uma perna o que lhe relegou a uma posicao de deficiente fisico.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nApesar disso Jose nao desanimou, e nem se deixou abater muito menos considerar-se invalido. Antes pelo contrario arregacou as mangas e foi a luta. Luta para garantir o pao de cada dia para o seu agregado familiar. Pelo facto de a sua pensao de invalidez que ele recebe do Ministerio de Defesa nao ser suficiente para sustentar sua familia, ele resolveu entrar para o programa de credio do FDM para poder se beneficiar de um emprestimo. Assim ele passou a comprar roupa em Maputo e a vende-la num dos mercados da cidade de Xai-Xai.<p>\r\n<p>\r\ninfelizmente a sua esposa certamente nao se contentando em ter um marido deficiente fisico, roubou-lhe alguns bens e abandonou-o a ele e aos filhos ainda menores. isto faz 2 anos. Neste momento Jose nao pensa em arranjar outra mulher. Diz ele que tem forcas para criar os filhos sozinho. Todavia e possivel que num futuro a medio prazo pensa em arranjar uma companheira. Mas ele tera muito cuidado ao escolher aquela que vira a ser a futura esposa e mae de seus filhos, para nao cair no mesmo engodo em que caiu pela primeira vez. Mas apesar disso Jose esta convicto que a vida nao deve parar. a frente e que deve ser o caminho.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nEle viaja duas vezes por mes para Maputo afim de comprar roupa e chinelos para a sua banca.Na primeira viagem ele compra roupa correspondente a 3.000,00 Mt e na segunda viagem compra roupa correspondente a 1500,oo, pos que e para reforcar o stock. No futuro se o negocio correr bem ele pensa em melhorar a sua residencia usando material convencional pois que agora a casa e de paua pique.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":115383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase more clothing and sandals in Maputo for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Xai-Xai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.051944 33.644167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":64,"posted_date":"2008-01-28T21:13:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-11T22:06:11Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":760,"processed_date":"2008-03-11T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-11T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":898.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155618,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":760,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-11T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":898.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179874,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":760,"processed_date":"2008-05-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-11T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":898.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":207456,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":36,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2008-06-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-11T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":851.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":235340,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-28T22:06:11Z","paid_date":"2008-06-11T09:10:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":31514,"name":"Lieng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.
