She did not even reach high school, but her life story does not simply end there. Patricia is married to Ricardo, a mason with regular work. Together they take care of their only child, a daughter, in their home in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nTo cope with financial difficulties, Patricia has set up her own carinderia (food stall) located in Intramuros, Manila. Here, she cooks delicious meals for customers who find it easier to buy cooked food than to prepare their own, especially on busy days. Patricia has been running her carinderia for seven years. She is also buys and sell palay (rice grain). Her entrepreneurial efforts earn her Php11,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo improve her carinderia, she decided to borrow Php30,000 with the help of CCT* to improve both her food business as well as her trading business. Aside from quality food ingredients, she also intends to buy palay and sell it to business connections. She plans to have small homes to rent to boarders. \r\n\r\nOne struggle Patricia faces is family finances, as the price of the goods in the market has soared. But she knows she will overcome, because the Lord of her life is one faithful Provider. She desires to see the expansion of her business and allow her family to experience prosperity. Currently, she is saving up for her child\u2019s education. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

She lives with her husband and their children in Sanoubougou I-Kapel Kourou, an outlying district of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After having run many business unsuccessfully, Kadidia became familiar with buying and selling cooking oil, Arab couscous, Maggie bouillon cubes, and many other types of goods. She has been in this business for over six years and runs it out of her house and at the market in her district, where she has a spot at her disposal. She is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, Kadidia decided to join again the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over two years ago. She is currently on her fourth loan. The previous ones have all been repaid. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use her loan to buy: \u00a07 containers of cooking oil, 5 boxes of Arab couscous, 10 boxes of Maggie bouillon cubes, 3 boxes of Arawane tea, and a supply of condiments. She buys her merchandise by special order in Bobo Dioulasso (Republic of Burkina Faso) and also from local oil mills, and then she sells them retail at the market in their town.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Kadidia envision making a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially for helping with family expenses and paying the loan interest.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her children and husband in Sanoubougou I-Kapel Kourou Sikasso (in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAfter trying several businesses unsuccessfully, Madam Safiatou B. started buying and selling tubers (potatoes, sweet potatoes, yam etc.) 10 years ago. She sells her goods at the bus station in Sikasso to a customer-base mainly made up of travelers but also of carriers. She is very much sought after by her customers for the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet the needs of her ever-increasing customer-base, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution approximately two years ago. She benefited from a first loan, which she successfully paid off.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of boosting her business, she is requesting this second loan that will allow her to increase her working capital and buy 15 cases of potatoes, 10 bags of sweet potatoes and 10 bags of yam in Sikasso and its outskirts.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA francs, which will be mainly used to increase her working capital, contribute to the family expenses and pay the interests of her loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more seeds and fertilizer to sow for a good harvest and to take care of his children and his home.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Berdikul was born on August 2, 1948. Coming from an area where raising cattle is popular, Berdikul has been selling cattle since 1996. He buys them in his village from farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Berdikul would like to expand his business and increase his capital so that he can maximize his profits. For this reason, Berdikul is requesting this loan to purchase calves. This will be his first loan with IMON International and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will each be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nFifty-five year old Jessika K. K. is the leader of this group of teachers. Jessika was born in Kailahun, she is married and has 2 children who are in college. Jessika is a teacher and a businesswoman. She has been in the teaching profession for 35 years now. Jessika is going to use her share of this loan to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 57-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating six business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store, dry goods, mineral water refill, buying & selling wood, electronic re-loading and room-for-rent businesses.  She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her six businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 27,000.  Luciana is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund her business operations. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Luciana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have three children who are 8 to 20 years old. One of the children has his own family and the other two are currently going to school. Annabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to pirchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and future family needs. Annabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She gets her supplies from farmers in nearby villages and retails at the great market in Bougouni, for cash or credit, to a clientele made up of men and women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, she expects to make an average profit of 20,000 CFA francs a month. She will use part of it to repay her loan and the remaining amount will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":718247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

is a married woman who lives in Escalante City, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating a dried fish vending business and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Gregorio, who is 60 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 13 to 19 years old. Angelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of their children. Angelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gnel says farming is very laborious, but it allows him to meet his family\u2019s needs. \r\nGnel and his family intend to enlarge their farm, which will allow them to increase their family's income in the future.  Gnel is seeking a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy some cows for his farm.

She earns her living by operating a sari sari (general) store and a sugar cane\/farming business.  Her husband Jose, who is 62 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 25 to 37 years old. Concepcion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Concepcion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to use as more funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future family expenses.  Concepcion is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating an abaca weaving business.  Her husband Joselito, who is 27 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have four children who are 5 months to 7 years old. Gemmalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemmalyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to buy materials and abaca to weave so that she can continue to save up for future improvements for her business. Gemmalyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Danao City, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her buying and selling of firewood\/charcoal business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000.  Roselita is borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Roselita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Bernadette is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Bernadette aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She manufactures and sells bakery items consisting in turnovers, \"humitas\" (small cakes made from corn and sugar) and cakes.  She does this work based on orders from customers especially on weekends, holidays and occasionally for special events.  She home delivers her baked goods.  She has been in this line of work for two and a half years.  She also provides lunches for a group of senior citizens in the afternoons.  Albertina lives with her husband, her daughter and two granddaughters.\r\n\r\nThe Fondo Esperanza loan is for personal use because, due to the February 27, 2010 earthquake, her house was devastated.  She will, therefore, buy building materials and supplies to repair the walls in her house thus living more securely.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to own a bakery where she can produce all her products and continue going out to home deliver them.  With respect to her house it is to repair it completely but she needs a lot of money to do so.\r\n\r\nFondo Esperanza loans have been very useful for Albertina to stay in business and rebuild her home.  She feels very happy and content with what she\u2019s learned at the communal bank group meetings; it has served her well to budget her income and save profits.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is situated at the mouth of the B\u00edob\u00edo River.  It has been very important in our history since it was the site of important battles and settlements, especially during the Arauco War, because it borders Mapuche territory.  Currently the city has an important economic and demographic development being considered one of Chile\u2019s most relevant urban, demographic, administrative, financial and commercial nucleuses after Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":715614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy building materials and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-02-23T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":310053,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16301},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":16406},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":16512},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16619},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16727},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16835},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16943},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":17053},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17163},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16832},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":17778},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17498},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":17611},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17725},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":17839},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17955},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":18071},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":18185}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":71.2,"local_amount":32707,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":33341.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839765,"comment":null},{"amount":145.2,"local_amount":66693,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67987,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282257,"comment":null},{"amount":186.72,"local_amount":85769,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":87433.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150264,"comment":null},{"amount":153.86,"local_amount":70673,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":72044.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223347,"comment":null},{"amount":118.02,"local_amount":54211,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":55262.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216502324,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-23T05:12:49Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:03:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276148,"name":"Joshua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joshua is 42 years old and married with three children.

P., 39, lives in the La Playa development, very near the ocean.  In that ambience of sea breezes and the ocean she undertakes her work selling catalogue merchandise and other items not in catalogues that her customers order from her like perfumes, school supplies, shoes, clothing for women, men and children and, in general, whatever her good customers request.\r\n\r\nThe business started four years ago when she still wasn\u2019t enrolled with any of the catalogue firms; at that time she did it through a friend.  Gradually her customer base grew and she became independent adding a lot more merchandise that wasn\u2019t included in the catalogues and she also subscribed to several magazines in order to sell all kinds of merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first with Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy school supplies taking advantage of the season in which schools restart classes and these products are quick sellers.  This investment bodes success because her customers, parents, can satisfy the pressing need to supply their children with books, notebooks, pencils, rulers, etc. needed to do well in school.  In addition, Aida will also sell school uniforms and shoes for students because she\u2019ll buy them in large quantities and then offer generous discounts.  She will sell them to the parents on credit which will make their children\u2019s access to education easier.\r\n\r\nSince starting financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n she\u2019s reached goals in her business, like earning profits to contribute to her home and, above all, having additional capital of her own to respond to customer demand.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is to have a warehouse, to position her business in the marketplace, to increase profits and to continue improving her family\u2019s conditions because she and her spouse work hard and make the effort so that their four children, ranging in ages between 4 and 20, will attain prosperity and success, derived from a quality education, and better future employment options.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.24,"image":{"id":718376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"

There he sells hardware products such as PVC, electrical cables, nails, screws, sandpaper, and welding supplies at wholesale.  He purchases these products from a distributor in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, and sells them to different hardware stores in the city of Barranquilla.  John Carlos started this business after he gained four years of experience working for a company that sold hardware.  He decided to become independent so that he could start his own business.

These products also have high turnover.  With his Kiva loan, he will also take advantage of bids being generated this month at commercial auctions where products that have low turnover are being offered at good prices.  John Carlos manages his business mainly through cash sales and credit payments he collects on a weekly basis.

Her family consists of her husband and their two children, ages 3 and 8.  Yuris lives in the August 7th neighborhood of the town of Puerto Colombia, which is very close to the sea.  She is known for her charismatic personality and manages a gift shop where she sells stationery, women\u2019s accessories, perfumes, stockings, shoes, and undergarments for infants.  Yuris started this business two years ago with very little merchandise and only one display cabinet.  She keeps adding products requested by her customers which she did not have before.  As a result, she acquired three more display cabinets so that she could keep her merchandise organized and prominently displayed like any good business should.  With great affection, Yuris says that it is common in Puerto Colombia for people to organize bingo games as fundraisers for social and personal events.  She has specialized in selling beautifully packaged gifts that can be used for these types of events.  Recently she started attending academic conferences and established relationships with several schools.  For this reason, she has experienced an increased demand in school supplies such as folders, notebooks, diaries, pens, and stationery.  To keep up with demand, she is requesting a Kiva loan, which will be her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Anabel is a new member, having started out at the communal bank 4 months ago.  She is 27 years old, married common-law, and she has a three year old daughter. She is very hard working and she provides public transport with her rickshaw. She started this business because she needed a driver and the drivers that she used to hire never worked out, resulting in lower revenues. This is the reason why Anabel started out as the driver of her own rickshaw taxi service. Her husband is in charge of the other rickshaw that they have. Anabel contributes with her husband towards the household expenses and those of their daughter. With the help of her income she purchased a refrigerator. She requests a loan to pay for the repair of the motorcycle that is used by her husband. Anabel says that she would like to set up a stand in a market to sell clothing for children and adults.

Marcelino, es un hombre de mucho provecho, se dedica con mucho esmero a la labor que realiza. Su trabajo consiste en labrar la tierra, es campesino y cuenta con 08 hect\u00e1reas de terreno; donde ha cultivado, caf\u00e9, hojas de coca y cacao; frutos oriundos de la zona selv\u00e1tica del Valle R\u00edo Apurimac.

Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde la chacra hasta la ciudad de san francisco; lugar donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus productos; pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es comprar nuevas tierras para expandir sus sembr\u00edos y aumentar en su producci\u00f3n.

He lives with 35 year-old Melisa and they have 3 children with whom they live in their own home in San Luis community, in Cusco department.  Marcelino is a very hard-working man who puts a lot of care into farming his land.  He is a farmer and has 8 hectares of land where he grows coffee, coca leaf and cacao, all of which are native crops of the jungle area of the Apurimac Valley.  \r\n\r\nMarcelino has been working for 10 years and during harvest time he has the support of laborers.  In this way he is able to quickly harvest his crops and sell them to the traders who pay him very well for every kilogram of produce that he sells.  He considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his products from the farm to the town of San Francisco where they offer him the best prices for his products.  However, right now, his goal is to buy new land so that he can grow more crops and increase his production in order to provide his family with good financial stability.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelino's first loan from MFP and he feels that this support will help him a lot in making progress in his work.  He is ready to make his loan repayments according to schedule.  He is grateful to Prisma for offering him the loan.  He will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles he has requested to hire laborers to get rid of the weeds that are attacking his plantations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":718580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire laborers to help him weed his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-23T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":175.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":174.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":185.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":197.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":201.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":208.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":224.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":231.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":175.45,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":176.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327775,"comment":null},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":174.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196294,"comment":null},{"amount":66.45,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":183.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269975,"comment":null},{"amount":67.66,"local_amount":186.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":187.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549992,"comment":null},{"amount":71.8,"local_amount":198.08,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":198.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718667,"comment":null},{"amount":72.41,"local_amount":199.75,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":200.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350094,"comment":null},{"amount":76.18,"local_amount":210.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":210.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850633,"comment":null},{"amount":79.05,"local_amount":218.08,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":218.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665860,"comment":null},{"amount":164.52,"local_amount":453.83,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":455.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621030,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-26T05:08:40Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":276262,"name":"Juan Bautista","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan tiene 70 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y reside junto a su familia en el en el distrito la Matanza ubicado en la Provincia de Morrropon que pertenece a la regi\u00f3n Piura, que se ubica a m\u00e1s de cuatro horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo capital de la Regi\u00f3n de la Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica a trabajar en labores asociadas a la agricultura desde hace muchos a\u00f1os, el suele sembrar ma\u00edz amarillo en un peque\u00f1o terreno de cultivo con el que cuenta, luego de la cosecha lo vende a buen precio.

He used to work in a tuna factory but wanted to work for himself and make his own income.\r\n\r\nEdgar currently works from Monday to Sunday, from 8.00am to 7.00pm.  One of the difficulties he has during the winter is that the streets get damaged which negatively affects the transportation of passengers in the area. \r\n\r\nEdgar's wife sells fish since her family are fish sellers in the area.  Edgar will use his loan to fix his 'tricimoto' (a motorbike with a cabin in the back for transporting passengers).

and Rosario P. started Pac Jim Party Rentals in 2007 as a weekend business.  Pac Jim provides jumping balloons (moonwalks), tables, and chairs for outdoor functions.  The jumping balloons are large inflatables that children can play inside, and they are often used at social gatherings.  Fidel personalizes the jumping balloons by attaching an additional inflatable figure in the likeness of a superhero, movie or television character to the top of the main jumping balloon.\r\n\r\nA former U.S. Marine, Fidel works full-time with a trucking company in border-crossing operations.  Fidel started Pac Jim so that his teenage children could earn spending money without working during the week.  It has grown faster than they ever thought it would and it has the added bonus of allowing them to spend time together as a family.  Fidel says they stay busy every weekend from mid-February to November.  \r\n\r\nFidel found ACCION Texas-Louisiana\u2019s website through an internet search he conducted after being denied financing by a commercial bank.  Fidel is using this loan to buy 6, 10\u2019x30\u2019 party canopies.  He and Rosario have decided to add canopies to their inventory after receiving multiple requests from customers.  In fact, they are Pac Jim\u2019s most requested item after the jumping balloons.  They previously bought canopies at a superstore locally, but the canopies were not commercial quality and quickly broke.  Fidel will also buy new balloon prints representing characters from this year\u2019s blockbuster movies.  \r\n\r\nWhile the inflatable industry is relatively new to El Paso, Fidel says it is very competitive.  Competition is such that he must take reservations without deposits, allowing clients to wait until the last minute to cancel without penalty.  Pac Jim Party Rentals is fully licensed with the Texas Bureau of Insurance, which is good, given the active environment the balloons encourage.  Fidel claims to be one of only two inflatable rental businesses in the area that are covered by insurance, and he points out that should someone be injured, the insurance provides the injured party recourse for their injury.\r\n\r\nFidel wants to someday grow his business volume to the point that he can add a team of 3-4 employees.  This would allow them to handle working more sites per weekend.\r\n\r\nCheck out their website at

is a married woman who lives in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari sari (general) store.  Her husband Edcor, who is 40 years old, works as a government utility employee to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 8 years old. Cecelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000 thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for her children's education. Cecelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Alona is requesting a new loan of 26000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & snacks. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Alona from HSPFI.

Her husband Tadeo, who is 40 years old, works as a construction worker to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 3 and 15 years old. Purisima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Purisima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to buy equipment and tools to provide better service to her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Purisima is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Julieta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to add to her capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Julieta from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and to assist in her grandchildren\u2019s education.

is from the village of Napurog Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 54 years old, married and has three adult children. To make a living, Rosario runs an agricultural business, raising crops in the local community. Rosario has been engaged in her business for 3 months and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nRosario joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, with which, she will purchase additional inventory and use towards working capital. This will be the seventh loan taken out by Rosario from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

J. is from the village of Digkilaan, Iligan City. He is 29 years old. Renante is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Renante owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. He makes his income primarily from buying and raising pigs for sale and also providing motorela or habal-habal services to local community members. Renante has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Renante joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Renante has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Renante is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Renante from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. This loan will be Erlinda's second loan from ASKI.

is 32 years old, married and supports her family by operating two business ventures:  soft drinks and water refilling.  She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her soft drinks and water refilling businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,600. Elsie is borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elsie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sergia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,900 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her businesses. Sergia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is a construction worker and a farmer who owns a small piece of land where he grows rice to sell to support his family. His wife, Mrs. Srey Sor Choeun, does housework.

To earn a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector. Specifically, she plants and harvests rice for sale in her local community.

In turn, she has been better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her standard of living. Notably, this would be her seventh loan through PMPC. Most recently, she successfully repaid a prior loan in the amount of 14,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to purchase additional inventory and for additional working capital. Emma is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product line.

Her husband Federico, who is 58 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 12 to 33 years old. Felicidad joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felicidad has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000 to buy some items for her pillow business so that she can continue to save up for future renovation of their house. Felicidad is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
