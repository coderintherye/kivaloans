She is 40 years old, a widow and the mother of 6 children, all of whom attend school. Her husband died after a long illness. \r\n\r\nShe started a small business selling wood in 2004. She started the business with her own funds and, later in 2005, was the beneficiary of a $50 loan from the organization Hekima to strengthen her business. She sells her merchandise roadside on the principal route. She also sells gravel to construction workers. With this new loan, she will purchase supplies notably construction materials to sell to deprived work-sites. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to build a home and have the opportunity to educate her orphaned children comfortably. Additionally, her ambition is to have a motorcycle to use as part of a taxi business; she has already fully paid for the motorcycle she currently has. (Kahindo A. purchased the motorcycle with the earnings from her business.) \r\n\r\nKahindo A. thanks the organization Hekima for its actions in helping poor widows, unlike a traditional bank.

All this started because Farida\u2019s husband became interested in sand block production and then concluded that this business would be profitable. For two years now, this business has been the main source of family income. From the profits, they have managed to purchase equipment for sand block manufacturing (200000 soms) and also to obtain a flat (100000 soms). They earn on average 28,000 soms per month.\r\n\r\nThe family is planning to purchase a used car. They already have some money, but need some extra funds to achieve their aim. Hence they need a loan. In the future the couple want to expand their business and to begin producing glazed tiles.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Her eldest son is 26 and the youngest is 8 years old; all her children are in education. She began selling Primus beer and Fanta 26 years ago. She began the business with funds that she received from her father, around 50$. She showcases her wares from her home and sometimes on the road. This loan will enable her to boost her revenues by purchasing a 1100$ plot of land through cumulative loans. The main obstacle is that she sells her goods in local currency (Congolese franc). However this currency is not stable and is subject to high inflation and often loses value against the dollar; all Congolese merchants fear the franc and keep their transactions in dollars.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her daughter Katy, age 20, in her own home in the Palcamayo area. From her childhood, she has worked in agriculture and with livestock; \"I took care of my parents' pigs and helped with the harvest\", she says. With time, she invested her strength and time in improving; so when she was young, she worked as a baker for 10 years. She still sells breads, cakes and other products. From her earnings, she has been able to save money and purchase her own land to cultivate vegetables, products which she sells wholesale in the central market of the capital. She recently opened a small store in her home. This way, she will be able to generate additional income for herself. Working in agriculture does not give her enough income, so she found it necessary to find a partner to help her with the sowing and the harvest, so that she only works alone on her land until harvest time. Her greatest wish is to purchase and sell land and to continue supporting her daughter in her agribusiness studies. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the support that her community bank has offered her in the development of her goals. With the 1000 soles that she is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of fertilizer for her next harvest, and pay her daughter's tuition.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269331,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T05:58:32Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233173,"name":"Alvaro Ciro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Alvaro Ciro T.

He lives in his own home in the town of Palcamayo with his parents Aparacio (age 60) and Teodora (age 55).  Edwing also has two siblings who do not live with them.  His life is defined by his efforts.  He is motivated to succeed so that he can support his sister Ana who is studying culinary sciences in the capital.  Edwing dropped out of seminary so that he could support her.  He invests approximately 1000 PEN each month into growing spinach, carrots, and beans and brings his produce to the central market in town where he can sell them.  In addition, he travels to the capital twice a month to sell his goods to the wholesalers who offer very good prices, which helps him obtain a good income.  He enjoys monitoring, watering, and fumigating his crops because vegetables have greater demand than other products.  Now he wants to venture into other areas of agriculture, so he plans to intensify his efforts at livestock breeding.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his seventh loan with MFP.

The carrots were planted four months ago.  For the past 15 years he has been growing vegetables and potatoes, produce that he later resells in the central market of his region. But when demand is high he travels to Lima to sell the harvest in wholesale. In two months' time he will harvest the carrots.

They live in a commercial district located north of the city. Since he was young he learned to drive a car and later when he had a family to support, he never thought twice about providing taxi services in the streets of this great city. Many years have passed and he now has a steady source of income, especially because he does not only work with occasional passengers but he also has some steady clients that call him when they need to travel safely and securely. Additionally, since it is his own care that he drives he decides his own routes and his own schedule. He likes to work alone in the days and at nights he rests. Generally he starts work at 6 in the morning and finishes at 6 in the evening, only taking a break for lunch. This is a typical day for the hard working person. In the future he has planned to purchase another car and rent it out. This is a first time loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to making his payments on time. He does not want to disappoint the people that made this loan possible, a loan that will let him continue his work. Mario will invest the loan requested in the purchase of new tires for his car. The ones on his car now are very old. He will also bring his car to the repair shop for maintenance. This way he expects to improve the service he is able to offer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To provide his car with necessary maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":156.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":164.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":169},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":181.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":160.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449961,"comment":null},{"amount":58.61,"local_amount":156.28,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":163.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588660,"comment":null},{"amount":61.74,"local_amount":164.65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":172.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725164,"comment":null},{"amount":129.07,"local_amount":344.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":361,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886663,"comment":null},{"amount":68.24,"local_amount":181.98,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":190.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-05T23:27:37Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233245,"name":"Hormiguitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La asociaci\u00f3n comunal \u201cHORMIGUITAS\u201d est\u00e1 iniciando su segundo ciclo.

This area is characterized by its distressed ecology. Due to lack of opportunities, he started working in a bakery at a young age to make his own income. When he grew up, he decided that this would be his main job. He bought a small oven and started to make bread and sell it throughout the area. He now makes breads and red donuts from flour (pictured in the photo) for his customers from 8:00 until nightfall.

In time her business grew and with her great charisma she captured many steady clients that buy from her regularly. She also makes recommendations on the best products to use.

She intends to use it as additional capital for her general store and other businesses, so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family. Ma.

Her husband works as a mason.  Letty sells bed sheets and raises chicks on her small farm.  She works everyday feeding and caring for her chicks, she sells her sheets on Saturdays and Sundays, and spends about 5 hours delivering and collecting since she sells on credit.  Letty purchases sheets in Picoaza and buys the chicks from a hatchery and after three months she delivers them to local stores.  She will use half the loan to purchase sheets and the other half for chicks.

She earns her living by operating a general store. She has two children who are aged 30 and 32. One already has a family and the other works and helps her in her business. \r\n\r\nCorazon joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Corazon has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and her own security. \r\n\r\nCorazon G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Cristina has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Omina hopes that the business goes well and her family has a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of her husband and the six children who still live with her and are dependent on her. Most of the family have an unstable source of income and are still under the umbrella of poverty. \r\n\r\nInstead of allowing herself to get stuck in the middle of the insecurities, in 2004, Maria May joined Kiva's field partner in the Philippines, ASHI, to access loans to enable her to be productive and flourish. She's used previous loans for her venture selling fish. The profits she makes augment her husband\u2019s income as a fisherman. As soon as her business grows, she will be able to support her children's and grandchildren\u2019s needs so they can enjoy the gifts of life. With this, her role as a mother will be completed. \r\n\r\nMaria May's membership in ASHI, and the loans she has received as a member, have assisted her in running her business. Maria May has been performing very well with her repayments, attendance, and business; thus qualifying her for a larger loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":454.25,"image":{"id":605010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

In this way, they stay fresh for a long time and do their work efficiently.  \r\n\r\nHer husband is involved in the animal-selling business. He buys animals of a young age from the market, grows them up and then resells them to the required customers. He has been in this profession for the past 10 years. He keeps the animals at his house and takes care of them.  \r\n\r\nJannat also helps him by taking care of his animals by giving them timely food and water and keeping their place clean to avoid diseases.  \r\n\r\nJannat has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan amount, her husband will buy young animals (goats and sheep) for his business.

She is married and has one 6-month-old child.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she established her shop business. Working seven days a week and seven hours a day, she supports her family. The loan from Patan BPW is to increase the inventory of her store.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rashmi plans to expand the business. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called <i>pasal<\/i>, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  \r\n\r\nWhile a typical <i>pasal<\/i> might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She does not have a well-built house but she never complains to her husband and spends her life happily with him in the two-room brick house.  Her husband's name is N. A. and he is involved in an animal-selling business. He has been in this business for the past 10 years. He specifically deals with goats because his clientele base is butchers so he sells goats to them to earn a profit. He buys goats from the animal market at cheap rates and sells them at a good profit. Due to his good knowledge of animal breeds, his customers contact him to arrange animals for them. In this way, his family financial circle runs. \r\nParveen has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy goats in bigger quantities and fulfill the orders of his customers. She is hopeful that this investment will prove beneficial for her husband and his income will double in size.  \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady who is slightly raising her hand is Parveen.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her meat vending and vegetables and spices vending activities, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,500 PHP. Mila Rose is now borrowing 27,000 PHP to continue to fund operations of her meat, vegetables and spices vending activities.  This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 27,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mila Rose aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 which she added to her own capital helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 25000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional bananas to sell. \r\n\r\nElena is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 4h loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fozil has always been hard-working man, who has made sure from his young age that his family never goes without their daily bread. He is married with 3 children. \r\n\r\nHe has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuff. With a starting capital of $200, and thanks to his perseverance and dedication, Fozil began this enterprise many years ago. Over time he expanded his business and today his whole family is engaged in the business. \r\n\r\nToday Fozil needs to buy additional foodstuff for increasing the range of his selling goods. With this purpose he is requesting a loan of $3,000. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.     \r\n      \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L. is a married woman who lives in Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending  business. Her husband Jeffrey L., 34 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have two children who are four and eleven years old. Gemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9000 PHP helped her to earn a monthly profit of 6500 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP which she intends to add to her own savings to purchase a fishing boat and to use as operating capital so that she could continue to earn enough and save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Gemma L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gulomdjon is 53 years old man. He is married and has two children. Gulomdjon\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life to get ahead and to fulfill his goals. He is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Kanibadam city in search of customers. He has owned his business for 3 years. \r\n\r\nToday Gulomdjon is planning to buy new and better car in order to earn more money. That is the reason he wants to borrow $1500 USD. Gulomdjon sincerely thanks Kiva and all lenders that make this help possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Khosiyatkhon promises to repay her loan without any violation and thanks everybody who decided to support her. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

One of the most active members of ASHI- Rizal Central Branch, she serves as an inspiration to many women in the community in joining the program. <p>\r\n\r\nToday Felicima is applying for a loan of P40,000.00 in pesos as additional capital for her business in order to increase her customer base and her income. This will enable her to start saving, help her youngest daughter complete college, and continue to help her husband in their financial needs. Her business plan is to construct a much wider space for her canteen and establish a grocery for her children to continue as the couple grows older. She wants to hire people and provide employment, especially to those out-of school-youth so that they can earn for their schooling. <p>\r\n\r\nFelicima is so happy and keeps praying that ASHI and KIVA will continue their partnership in providing financial assistance to poor but deserving families.

She has been selling cabbages for the last two years and has provided employment for one employee.\r\n\r\nCaroline says that her business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is that there are very many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers. Hence, customers are spoilt for choice.

She joined ASHI and was inspired by the stories she heard of other poor women. She wanted to become successful like them so because of this opportunity, Josefelia was able to start a fishing business.  She has taken all the risk of running a business; she thought she could be successful because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream of having all her children graduate from college.\r\n\r\nJosefelia hopes that her children never have to experience the hard life she and her husband had . She dreams of increased space for her fishing equipment and an expanded fishing business.  Josefelia\u2019s main challenge has been having a small stock due to the hindrances of small working capital to put into her fishing business. Therefore, Josefelia needs a larger loan to expand her fishing business. The fish her husband catches are sold by Josefelia in their village and to people selling fish in the market. She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and provide for other family needs. Josefelia\u2019s wish to give her children a brighter future fuels her commitment to her fishing business. \r\n\r\nWith all of her plans for the growth of her business, Josefelia would be happy if her children are able to achieve their personal dreams and have a life free of

M. is a married woman who lives in Calumpang, Poblacion, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two businesses: a general store and fish vending businesses. Her husband Melbert M., who is 41 years old, manages his own business to earn his living.  They have two children who are 10 and  13 years old. \r\n\r\nLorena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lorena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to stock more things to sell in her general store. She wants to continue to save up for the future security of her family, for her children's education and family needs. Lorena M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is a farmer from Kitale town in western Kenya where he has been farming for eight years and employs one farmhand. He sells his milk, eggs, maize and vegetables at a local market. He is a full-time farmer and depends on the income from his farm to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nWilfred recently repaid his previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan of 51,200 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says this loan will help improve the livelihood of his family since he will be able to provide them with enough milk for consumption and to pay school fees for his children with the income from the sale of milk.\r\n\r\nWilfred hopes that, in the future, he will be able to acquire four more dairy cows and four dairy goats and become the main milk supplier to the local market. His primary challenges are lack of storage facilities for his milk and the low price of milk.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":605157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase and insure a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-09-24T14:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wifred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":51200,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4266.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":4267,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4393.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437360,"comment":null},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":4272,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4398.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576745,"comment":null},{"amount":223.13,"local_amount":17576,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":18096.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712494,"comment":null},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":2532,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2606.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450291,"comment":null},{"amount":13.1,"local_amount":1032,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1062.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872380,"comment":null},{"amount":2.4,"local_amount":187.69,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":193.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668344,"comment":null},{"amount":172.44,"local_amount":13583.31,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":13985.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446875,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":4267,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4393.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535821,"comment":null},{"amount":44.22,"local_amount":3483,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3586.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221857530,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-24T16:32:49Z","paid_date":"2011-08-16T08:10:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233449,"name":"Twunguranibitekerezo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Emmanuel N., un des membres du groupe TWUNGURANIBITEKEREZO de sake dont les membres sont tous agriculteurs, il est mari\u00e9 et a 40 ans.

She is blessed to have two children, both of whom are minors and need her support.\r\n\r\nAmelita is a member of the Caridad center of Antique North Branch. She is a very strong-minded woman and she notes that she works hard to make their life quite meaningful. Despite trials brought about by poverty, she is still strong and dedicated in her pursuit to improve her family\u2019s standard of living. Amelita\u2019s main goal is to offer her two children a brighter future and that is what motivates her all day.\r\n\r\nTo make a good living, Amelita sells RTW (ready-to-wear-clothes) and has embarked on a livestock-raising business for added income. She has been engaged in these businesses for eight years.\r\n\r\nAmelita joined ASHI, one of Kiva\u2019s first partners in the Philippines, in 2002. During the course of her membership, she has been a good performer with regard to her attendance at center meetings, repayments, and her business.\r\n\r\nAmelita is now requesting her new loan, this time in the amount of 25,000 PHP, to obtain additional stock for her RTW business and to support the needs of her secondary business of livestock raising. She is positive that, with access to additional working capital through Kiva partners, her dreams of building her own comfortable house will be achieved.\r\n\r\nAmelita hopes that one day she will be able to have her own stall in the marketplace, instead of just in her house, from which to sell her RTW products; she wishes to be able to make enough savings to pay for her children's education and also wishes the best of life for her family. She also dreams of having an eatery business in the near future so that she can give an opportunity of employment to others.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":431.25,"image":{"id":605180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

A. is 67 years old and is a hardworking and strong mother. She is a widow and, being both father and mother at the same time, she took the responsibility of taking care of her six children.\r\n\r\nFeliza joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 1996. ASHI played an important role in her dreams for her family and that\u2019s why she maintains an outstanding performance as a member of the institution. She used the financial assistance that ASHI provided in her dressmaking business with which she earns her living. She was able to send her children to vocational school and support their daily needs. Today all her children have their own jobs.\r\n \r\nAs the years pass by, Feliza\u2019s business continues to prosper and her number of customers is increasing. She is applying for another loan of 45,000 pesos to buy raw materials for her dressmaking business and to improve her sewing production space.\r\n\r\nFeliza\u2019s dream is to build a dress shop, to buy more sewing machines and to hire sewers to meet the demands of her customers. She wants to provide employment in their community to help eradicate poverty. She will save the profits from this loan to continue her business plan.\r\n\r\nFeliza prays that ASHI and Kiva will continue to support her, not just in her business plan, but also in her good intentions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":605177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy

He is also a motor-taxi driver. \r\n\r\nHer problem is that it is time to grow crops in the field, but she does not have enough money to support planting. So, to improve production, Mrs. P.

Not being able to stay in school for very long because of lack of means, he enrolled in a woodworking training workshop. In 1982, at the end of his training, he opened a woodworking workshop.  Very enterprising, he has a large clientele and does his work quickly and very responsibly. His weekly sales range from 50,000 to 450,000 francs.  With the loan that he expects to receive, he is going to buy boards, such as plywood, beams, lathes, nails, glue and everything needed to build furniture. Very ambitious, he has big plans for the future: to open a large workshop and a furniture display shop.

S. is from the village of Rogongon, Iligan City. She is 56 years old. Purita is married and has two adult children. To make a living Purita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income of the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Purita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Purita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Purita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Purita from HSPFI.

R. Simeo has been operating an agro produce sales business in Kyengando village, Ibanda for a period of over 20 years. With nostalgia, this happily married father of four children recalls how his business basked in high profit returns at its onset. Times have changed, however, as the business now is in diminishing returns earning him 200,000 Ugandan shillings in sharp contrast to the previous earnings due seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nSimeo is no exception in terms of doing business. What he is looking forward to now is the prospect of enhancing his business by buying fertilizer and improving production of bananas and coffee which he grows the most of. Under the auspices of this loan, he will improve on business expansion and production through mulching the plantations. He hopes to improve his revenue and also make himself more able to meet his day-to-day family necessities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.67,"image":{"id":605306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buying
