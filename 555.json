Since he is an extremely hard worker, Armando knows that he must invest all of his efforts to achieve success in life.  He grows potatoes, corn, and peas.  Once the harvest season arrives, he brings his products to the wholesale market in Tarma to sell to his customers.  They are knowledgeable of the quality of his crops, which explains why they are bought up so quickly.  What he enjoys most about his work is protecting his crops from disease.

Se iniciaron con solo 2 maquinas y al poco tiempo 2 m\u00e1s y hoy tienen 10 cabinas para este fin, y una para el control de las horas de las maquinas. Desde entonces, no dispone de mucho tiempo libre, y sus ganancias son muy alentadoras y eso le motiva a seguir trabajando con el mismo dinamismo, pero tambi\u00e9n se llena de mucho temor en  invertir m\u00e1s; por lo que en su barrio hay mucha delincuencia. Esta contenta de ser un apoyo y pilar para su hijo, por ello se propone construir el segundo piso donde trasladen su negocio y le sea m\u00e1s seguro su negocio. Es el 11avo cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y pertenece  a un grupo de cr\u00e9dito muy peque\u00f1o conformado de tres personas, pero si todas son muy responsables, por lo que se siente orgullosa de trabajar con ellas. Asimismo promete pagar puntualmente. De obtener el cr\u00e9dito Hermilinda, comprar\u00e1 una impresora, para renovar la que tiene en uso, de este modo continuar trabajando con las anhelos de sobresalir.\n\n","en":"Hermelinda, aged 52, is a very jovial woman. She lives in her own house, together with her husband Antonio, aged 60, and 5 of their children - they have 7 in total. They all try to succeed together.\r\n\r\nFor many years Hermelinda worked preparing buffets for all sorts of events. 2 years ago, however, she and her son started an Internet cafe in their home. They started with just 2 computers, before long had 2 more, and today they have 10 booths available, plus one more computer to manage the timetabling of the machines available. This now takes up most of their time, and the profits are very encouraging, which motivates them to keep working with the same dynamism that got them started. Hermelinda is nervous about investing more, however, because there is a lot crime in their neighbourhood. She is happy to be able to provide support to her son, and she proposes building a second story onto their home, which they would move the business into, and which would be more secure. \r\n\r\nThis is Hermelinda's 11th loan with [field partner] MFP. She belongs to a small group of 3 borrowers, who are all very responsible women, and Hermelinda is proud to work with the others. By the same token, she promises to make her repayments on time. On obtaining the loan, Hermelinda will buy a printer, and continue her work with the same drive to improve.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":722640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"Comprar una impresora.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":231.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":243.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":253.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":266.32},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":276.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.53},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.01},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.65},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.53,"local_amount":227.82,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":232.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327807,"comment":null},{"amount":111.03,"local_amount":302.81,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":308.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196323,"comment":null},{"amount":63.31,"local_amount":172.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550019,"comment":null},{"amount":77.25,"local_amount":210.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":214.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718697,"comment":null},{"amount":214.88,"local_amount":586.03,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":597.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-01T18:45:39Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":278076,"name":"Miss Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Miss est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras, esforzadas y emprendedoras ellos son Alcira R., Erika  S. y Luvis Enrique C..

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Salvador, Jr., who is 47 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 20 and 24 years old. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,500 to purchase more stock for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education and for better living conditions. Helen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a bakery and buying and selling dried fish. Her husband Narsiso is 59 years old. They have five children who are 25 to 33 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000 as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family and business needs. Teresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy additional tools and equipment for her shop so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her business. Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating fishing and fish vending businesses. Her husband Benito, who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 15 and 24 years old. Isabelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Isabelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for education and home repairs. Isabelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Melody is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund the operation of her businesses. This will be her second loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Melody aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  videoke and a general store. Her husband Pedro, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 11 children who are between 1 and 21 years old. Ma. Magadalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Magadalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,600 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for business and buy stocks for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Magadalena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

M. is married and has three children. He was born in Kum-Aryk village in a large family and spent most of his time helping his parents in the household, pasturing cattle in the mountainous areas with native grasses, and helping his mother with milking the cows. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating from secondary school, Nazhipbek devoted his life to breeding animals. He stayed with his parents in his native village and takes care of them. Gaining a wide experience in this activity, the start up of his own business was successful. With the initial capital of 15,000 KGS, he managed to earn about 2,500 KGS each month. \r\n\r\nTaking into account that farming is the major means of subsistence for Nazhipbek\u2019s family and his elderly parents, he spends a lot of time improving his farm. Being a persistent and hard-working man, he has developed his farm and presently has three milk cows and twenty sheep.  With the revenues from this activity, Nazhipbek  was able to pay for the education of his elder children, who study in the capital of Bishkek.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNazhipbek plans to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to broaden his livestock business. In the future, he dreams of building a big house for his children and grandchildren. \r\n\r\nAbout Bai-Tushum and Partners:\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable members of the population.

This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to buy additional goods for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.

Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and improvement of her business. Griselda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":722816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of 1750 WST to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 WST per week) to improve and\/or expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Maria's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":722821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She has 2 years of experience in this business.  Loreta needs a loan of 1500 WST to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST per week) to improve and\/or expand the business.\r\n\r\nLoreta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Loreta's 2nd loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded South Pacific Business Development to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":722828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

selling plant seedlings and young crops to local farmers.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Saitia needs a loan of 2650 WST to purchase agricultural equipment to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST) to improve and\/or expand the business.\n\nSaitia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Saitia's 4th loan with SPBD. \n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded South Pacific Business Development to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  vegetable and fruit vending and fish vending. Her husband Leonardo, who is 45 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 2 and 24 years old. Amelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her 22nd loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund the operation of her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the education of her children.

is a 42-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fruits and vegetables vending business. She lives in Quezon, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fruits and vegetables vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,800. Genita is borrowing PHP 14,000 to fund the operation of her business. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Genita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,500. Servillana is borrowing PHP 10,000 to so that she could stock up on more firewood to sell.  This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Servillana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nThe accompanying photo shows Servillana posing beside a stack of

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Norma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $69 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Norma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a married woman who lives in Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating an abaca weaving business and a general store. Her husband Nillard, who is 32 years old, works as a miner to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 3 and 9 years old. Divina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Divina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,400 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000  to buy abaca and stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of children. Divina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  hog-raising, livestock and ready-to-wear clothes\/pants. Her husband Ramil, who is 31 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 7 and 8 years old. Fidelin joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Fidelin has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy livestock supplies so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and renovation of her house. Fidelin is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $58 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy products for the store to sell to customers. In addition to her business, she serves in her community as the Barangay Kagawad of their Barangay near to her home.  Ma.

She earns her living by operating a general store, an electronic loading business and a welding shop. Her husband Ariel, who is 37 years old, works as a welder to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 3 and 10 years old. Mercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her business. Mercy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nayme is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund the operation of her business.  This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Mao, who was born in 1964, is a fruit seller who is able to earn a small income to help support her family.  Since her business is doing well, she wants to expand it.  Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy more fruit to enlarge her business.  Mao\u2019s husband owns a motorbike used to transport his wife\u2018s fruit to the market to sell.

Mercelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy more stock so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education & household improvements.

is a 45-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating dried fish vending and food vending businesses.  She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Violeta is borrowing PHP 21,000 to fund operations. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Violeta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have five children who are 4 to 20 years old. Josephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josephine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,900, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy more fish to sell in the market so that she can continue to save up for her children's education & household improvements. Josephine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He says that he requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad so that he could invest in seasonal fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, chili peppers, onions, apples, papayas, bananas, watermelons, and other types of produce.  Hugo has been in this business for approximately five years.  He started working with his parents and later with his sister.  Afterwards, he decided to establish his own business because he was not earning enough working with his sister.  Hugo was already married and needed to earn enough money to support his wife.  He says that with what he earned he was able to save enough money to stock his stand.  His merchandise comes from the central supply depot in Toluca in the State of Mexico.  Hugo buys at this location because the prices are better, which means he earns a little bit more profit from the sale of his products.  He restocks his inventory on Saturdays and works at different markets during the rest of the week.  \r\n<p>\r\nHugo is pleased because Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad has given him this loan, in addition to the little bit of interest he has earned.  He is grateful for the trust that FRAC has demonstrated to him.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Hugo has been married for four years to Sra. Juana, who is also a fruit merchant.  They have two children, ages 2 and 3.  One of his goals is to buy a semi-used truck because he currently drives a very old model that breaks down all the time.  He also plans to start a small avocado orchard in the future as a long-term business.  He is confident that he will do well in this business.  Later on, he will buy peach trees so that he can expand his orchard a little more.  Hugo says this loan will be of great help because the income he generates will cover his household and business expenses.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":717385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase different types of fruits & vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-09T03:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":683.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":759.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":775.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":792.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":809.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":827.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":845.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":863.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":881.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":900.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":920.39},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":940.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":122.62,"local_amount":1442.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1484.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292459,"comment":null},{"amount":202.14,"local_amount":2378.1,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2446.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160717,"comment":null},{"amount":142.16,"local_amount":1672.2,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1720.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233591,"comment":null},{"amount":148.34,"local_amount":1745.12,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1795.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512416,"comment":null},{"amount":154.82,"local_amount":1821.25,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1873.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223098,"comment":null},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":940.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":967.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-10T05:37:21Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":278254,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Paula Mart\u00ednez M. ella es originaria de la localidad del Chirimoyo ubicado en el estado de Michoac\u00e1n, conocido porque muy cerca de ah\u00ed se encuentra el santuario de la mariposa monarca, las pir\u00e1mides de Zirahuato, tambi\u00e9n es conocido por su artesan\u00eda y por la deliciosa gastronom\u00eda.

Mrs. D. has been a merchant for over 20 years. She buys and sells foodstuffs and many other miscellaneous products. She developed a passion for this activity since childhood. She is seeking a loan of 1,925,000 FCFA to purchase foodstuffs such as agro-food and forest produce, and various others products, in order to further expand their business. They hope to increase their revenues and better provide for their respective families.\n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.

Members typically put in $2 USD per week.

Garc\u00eda lives in the state of Tecpatan, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico. She's married to Fidel Saraos Hern\u00e1ndez. They have a 20-year-old daughter under their care, Matilde, who also supports the household income. This is Mar\u00eda's first loan request, and she plans to use it to invest in merchandise to supply her small convenience store. She has three years' experience with this business and says that it is going very well because it provides income. She started this business after she was encouraged by her children, who are married and said they would support her in starting the convenience store, and in that way support herself and make headway for the family. With what she earns, Mar\u00eda buys things that her household is lacking, often the same stocked goods that end up in her store. What she desires most is for her business to grow day by day, have savings, and keep making headway until she goes to God. She joined the group out of invitation by Ma Luisa. Mar\u00eda liked the idea, so she accepted. The group is called \"Las Turquesas\" (\"The Turquoise\"), and the reason for the name is because they like the smell of this flower. The group members are as follows: Mar\u00eda del Rosario S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez, who will use the loan to purchase fabrics to sell by the meter in the communities; Eunice P\u00e9rez V\u00e1zquez, who will use it to buy dressmaking materials so she can make items to sell; Ma Luisa M.

","en":"Irene is a native of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. She is 58 years old and has a fifth-grade education. She says she stopped going to school because her parents didn't want her to continue her education due to a lack of financial resources because she had many siblings and they couldn't afford to buy books. Irene is married to Pedro, who makes a living as a construction worker. They have seven children, of which two live with them: Guadalupe, 21, and Tomasa, 12, who is in school. Irene runs a convenience store out of her home and makes a living selling ornamental flowers, avocados and chili peppers, since she has a garden and a nursery. She goes out on boats to sell them to suppliers in the city of Zitacuaro, and almost always what she sells is on order from customers. Irene is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to purchase eggs, sugar, soups, beans and other products of more primary need. She says that previously she made a living on selling seasonal fruits and legumes in the regional street markets but for health reasons she decided to open a store out of her home since her back and bones ached out of the effort from loading the very heavy cargo into the boats. She says that she and her clients are going to benefit from the loan because they won't go to other, more remote stores and will be able to find everything they need in her store. Irene will also be able to sell her avocados and chili peppers out of her home. Her goal is to expand her garden of avocados and chili peppers and also stock her store with products so that her local customers don't have to travel to Zitacuaro or have travel expenses. Irene says that her store is going very well and that her avocado and chili pepper sales are gaining customers in her area. She says with the earnings she makes she will paint and remodel her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":720317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase

Maribel is 30 years old and a native of the town of Viveros in the State of Michoac\u00e1n.  She likes being married to Sr. Andr\u00e9s, who works as a day laborer.  They have a one year old daughter named Andrea.  Both of them grow and sell flowers of various types.  Their high season is during the months of November and December.  Mari says she learned how to grow flowers from her father, who taught her when she was 12 years old.  She decided to pursue this activity because it generates a very good income, even though it requires a great deal of effort, time, and money.  Mari sells her flowers at the local markets in Mexico City.  She is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in order to buy paper, compost, and insecticides for her flower nursery.  Her challenge at the moment is having enough time and money to invest in her current crop of flowers so that she will have enough to sell.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mari says the loan will be a great benefit because she can give her daughter a better quality of life.  Another reason why she wants to stay ahead is so that she can pay her loan back and not fall behind due to a lack of money.  One goal she has for her business is to remodel her nursery since it is made of plastic and has deteriorated as a result of bad weather.  Another goal is to plant avocado trees on the land given to her by her parents.  Mari says, \u201cLater on I want to devote 100% of my time to growing avocados because the fertilizers and composts we use for growing poinsettias are highly toxic and gradually affecting my health as well as that of my husband.\u201d  Her profits from the sale of poinsettias have been good, so she will set aside some of the money to buy fertilizers for next year\u2019s crop of flowers.  Another portion will be used to finish the construction of her home.

Ella est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Eliseo quien es jornalero, ellos est\u00e1n casados desde hace 16 a\u00f1os, ellos tiene dos hijos de nombres Jos\u00e9 Armando de 16 a\u00f1os y Alex de 11 a\u00f1os, comenta que su hijo el mayor ya no sigui\u00f3 estudiando porque no tubo dinero este a\u00f1o para comprarle los \u00fatiles escolares y por eso este a\u00f1o ya no pudo entrar a la escuela, su otro hijo el menor estudia sexto de primaria.

","en":"Florinda is from the town of Los V\u00edveros, which is located in the State of Michoac\u00e1n.  She is 40 years old and studied up to the 5th year of elementary school.  She couldn't continue her studies because her parents didn't want to support her (they didn't have the money to buy her uniform and notebooks).\r\n\r\nFlorinda is married to Eliseo who is a laborer.  They have been married for 16 years and have two children: 16 year-old Jos\u00e9 Armando and 11 year-old Alex.  She tells us that her eldest son isn't continuing his studies right now because she didn't have enough money to buy his school supplies this year.  For that reason, he can't attend school.  Her youngest son is in his 6th year of elementary school.\r\n\r\nFlorinda is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to invest in her grocery store, buying eggs, flour, sugar, etc.  She will also invest in buying manure, fertilizers and sprays for her avocado orchard.  Florinda also sells meals to the people who work opposite her home extracting materials from the sandbanks.\r\n\r\nOne of Florinda's worries is the fact that her eldest son is not studying due to a lack of resources.  She hopes that she will be able to put him back into school next year since she doesn't want him to continue losing years.  Florinda tells us: \"I want my children to have a career because the life of a laborer is very hard and wearing\".  She says that this loan will help her a lot because she will be able to save so that her oldest son can go to school and have a career which is the most important thing for her.\r\n\r\nOne of Florinda's goals is to be able to stock her grocery store with more products such as dairy goods and cold cuts.  This will mean that her customers won't have to travel to Zitacuaro to buy their essentials.  She tells us that preventing her customers from having to travel so far to buy their provisions will have a positive impact on her profits.  It will mean her family will enjoy a better quality of life and she will be able to buy her children what they most need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":720324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To invest in groceries for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-09T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":259.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":279.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":285.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":297.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":304.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":310.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":317.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":324.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":331.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.26},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.8},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.9,"local_amount":538.81,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":543.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292474,"comment":null},{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":576.76,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":581.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160732,"comment":null},{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":601.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":606.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233606,"comment":null},{"amount":106.92,"local_amount":1283.1,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-09T05:20:11Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":278300,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nJULIO CESAR P.

The group consists of three female members who know one another and are neighbors:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tSra. Aurelia Sol\u00eds M. will use her loan to buy women\u2019s gowns to restock her business.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Blanca Guti\u00e9rrez Dom\u00ednguez will buy chicken and a canvas sign to promote her business.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Juana Guti\u00e9rrez Mart\u00ednez will buy corn, gas, and meat to restock her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Blanca Guti\u00e9rrez Dom\u00ednguez is one of the group members.  She is 33 years old and has her high school diploma.  Blanca has two children.  Irma Samanta is 10 years old and a fifth grade student who helps with the orders in her business.  Brando David is 12 years old, is in the sixth grade, and lives with his father in Mexico City.  Sra. Blanca and her husband have been separated for a year.  She sells snacks and will use her loan to improve her business by purchasing canvas signs to promote her establishment, as well as buy chicken to replenish her inventory.  Blanca wants to convert her business into a Burger Sami franchise that sells fried chicken and hamburgers.  At the moment, her business is called \u201cLoncher\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez\u201d but in fifteen days she will change the name to \u201cBurger Sami\u201d.  Her customers include young families, teenagers, children, and young adults.  She offers her customers sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, baguettes, quesadillas, flautas, and crispy tacos.  Blanca started this business a year ago, but she has thirteen years of experience as a merchant thanks to everything her husband taught her.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband has a hamburger and hot dog business in Mexico City, so he imparted to her everything he knows about this trade.  Blanca started selling at the town festivals.  She borrowed 1500 MXN from her father which she used to invest in supplies.  Blanca borrowed a grill from her mother and bought three tables: one for setting up the grill, one for holding an ice chest, and another for keeping all of her ingredients.  Her business is in a rented location in the center of Ciudad Ayala that occupies two rooms of her house that is within walking distance.  This business is very important because it enables her to feed, clothe, and support her daughter. Her favorite part about her business is that she is her own boss.  If she feels sick or has to attend to an emergency, then she closes her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca is proud that she does not depend on anyone else.  Her greatest challenges are the rising costs and low sales that occur during the vacation season in the months of July, August, and December.  The earnings from her business are invested in clothes, shoes, and the household expenses.  Blanca wants to start selling another type of food, Kentucky Fried Chicken, so she plans to start a promotion with new signs and invest more into his product.   \r\n<p>\r\nHer business has helped her family whenever she has had to repay her parents for groceries, food, and tanks of gas.  Blanca owns a piece of land where the foundation of her house has been built, but it still lacks walls and a roof.  She wants to keep progressing so that she can build rooms that she can set aside for her business.  Blanca is pleased with this loan and confident that she will continue working to move forward.  With this loan and any subsequent financing, she hopes to grow her business even more.  She wants to make these improvements in the future so that her children can have a good education and a better lifestyle.  Sra. Blanca lacks additional education and there are many more things that she has to learn.  Fortunately, she has friends who do not speak badly about her and treat her like an equal.  \r\n<p>\r\nCiudad Ayala is a beautiful place with a warm climate.  There are several resorts such as Axocoche, Colibr\u00ed, and Agua Limpia that have spas in which the water flows from natural springs.  The members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cWe are very grateful that you exist and for giving us loans to improve our businesses.  We are confident that we will not disappoint ourselves because we have every intention of moving forward and continuing with our businesses.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":715677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is a mixed group of 21 individuals living near each other. They are represented by Mrs. Sokhna D., who is the Vice-President. Mrs. D. has been working for over 30 years selling fabrics, shoes, palm oil and miscellaneous items. She also prepares food for sale. She has chosen this work because she was attracted to it but also in the desire to earn an income allowing her to provide for her personal needs. She is seeking a loan of 2,250,000 West African Francs for her group. This loan is destined for purchasing various goods to increase the members\u2019 stock. The main objective of the group members is to increase their income and to improve the socioeconomic conditions of their respective families. \n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its

She lives with her two children in a house inherited by her father. A year ago she began a business of selling salchipapas (a dish made of potatoes and fried sausages), which has generated enough income for her to support her children. She prepares them next to her mobile stand, which is a little cart, and the majority of her customers like them because they are a fast food. Every afternoon she carries out this business at the door of her home. This way she doesn't have to neglect her children, and in the end, she feels satisfied when she has succeeded in selling everything she has prepared, since this assures her of good earnings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she trained to be a teacher, but, nevertheless, she has not been able to find a job in her profession. She could only find a job as an assistant, so she had to move her business to her new workplace. She feels pleased because she knows that her business is profitable and she will have a source of income from more than just her work. For that reason, she hopes to have her business well established in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from MFP. She is happy to know that she has financial support, since she has always demonstrated that she is responsible with her payments, and she thanks the people who will be grantors of the loan that she is applying for, since it will be very useful in the progress of her business. She will invest this loan in the purchase of ingredients and in moving her things to her new

She lives with her husband and their children in her own house. Since she was very young she has been working in the fields, and with time she has turned her work into an indispensible source of income. Thus she works every day and into the night, driving out to the fields to look after them. She also keeps animals, including sheep, cows and pigs, which she takes to the fields for pasture. She works alongside her whole family, and when her husband is involved, between them they are assured of having the income to support their family. Rayda is very satisfied at their continuing progress. She has decided to further improve their crop with better seed, however, because although the harvest so far has repaid the work they put in, there is always the risk of losing a harvest through bad weather. This is her first loan from [field partner] MFP. She is very happy in the knowledge that she can access such financial support, and is grateful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people who will stick together. She is also grateful to the lenders who will come forward to offer the money she is looking for, because it will be very useful in progressing her work. The loan she is seeking will be invested in buying sacks of fertilizer, and in employing casual labourers to help till the earth for the next planting."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":652.26,"image":{"id":723201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

The group is located in the town of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca, in the Cuauht\u00e9moc neighborhood.  All the members of the group are hard working and capable of doing whatever is necessary to earn income and have a good quality of life.  The members are from the same neighborhood so know each other well.  It has 12 members: 10 women and 2 men.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mrs. In\u00e9s L. Hern\u00e1ndez, 36.  She\u2019s a hard working single mother who has raised her children who are 10 and 7 years of age and in school.  She sells comforters via catalogue and also sells fast food.  In\u00e9s does these things because of the need she has to support her children and provide them with a good education.  In\u00e9s asked for the loan to buy more comforters to sell in order to have profits and be able to survive economically.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carmen X. C., 48, is also a group member.  She\u2019s been a widow for 12 years and only finished elementary school because her parents were very humble and were only able to afford that level of schooling for her.  Since then she has been in a variety of activities to be able to support her children; she has four: Alfonso, 26, who is married, Pablo, 22, who is single and employed, Perla, 20, who is married and Alma,18, who is married.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a locale where she sells soft drinks, Sabritas brand snacks, and juices, among others.  Her locale is located 15 minutes from her house.  Carmen\u2019s customers for the most part are truck drivers that pass by her locale since it\u2019s located at one of the town\u2019s exits.  In addition to the refreshment sales, on weekends she sells tamales to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s dream is to open a locale in her very house and sell more products in order to have more profits.  Carmen comments that she got a loan from another bank to buy ingredients to make the fast food.\r\n\r\nCarmen thanks all those who will fund the loan and who support people of limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe group members are:\r\n\r\nAurelia A.

The group is made up of four women who know one another and are neighbors. They are:\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. - she will use her loan to buy jugs of purified water to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Magdalena F. M. - she will buy earrings and bracelets to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez Hern\u00e1ndez - she will buy sandals, shoes, sneakers, and cowboy boots to stock her business; and\r\n\r\nMs. Rosa F. God\u00ednez - she will buy <i>jitomates<\/i>, onions, tomatoes, chilies, lettuce, and fruits to stock her business.\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. is 42 years old. She studied one year of primary school. She lives in a common-law marriage and has three sons: Miguel, 25, is married and works; Aurelia, 24, went to work in the United States; and Martha Patricia, 23, went to work in the United States.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a business grinding <i>nixtamal<\/i> [dried corn] and selling dough, jugs of purified water, and soft drinks. She is requesting this loan to buy jugs of purified water, corn, and cases of soft drinks. Her business is called \"Molina El Rey\" [\"The King's Mill\"]. She offers her clients milling services and she sells jugs of purified water and soft drinks. She started her business 20 years ago because there wasn't anyone selling goods there, since  it was a new settlement. She started by selling purified water and soft drinks, and a year ago, her husband bought the mill so they could start the business of selling dough and grinding nixtamal or chilies for <i>mole<\/i> [a traditional Mexican stew or soup]. Her brother-in-law and her son, who work in a tortilla factory fixing the machines, taught her how to use the mill. Her brother-in-law got the mill for her and although it is small, she was able to start her business with savings from a time when she had gone to Cuernavaca.\r\n\r\nIt was her husband who gave her the idea to sell goods. They bought merchandise with money they had earned previously. The business is located in their house and it is important because it brings in money for food. Mar\u00eda's husband helps her to stock her business and to bring things, as well as to grind and deliver the corn. Her favorite part of her business is milling and selling dough. She is proud that her mill grinds well, and it is small and pretty. \r\n\r\nHer customers are her neighbors. Her business is popular because their town is small and hers is the only mill. She keeps her earnings so that if the mill breaks she can buy parts, and she also uses them to pay for electricity. She is planning to expand her business by selling sodas, and on Saturdays and Sundays she will sell <i>pozole<\/i>, crispy tortillas, and tacos. She would also like to start a small grocery store and she thinks she will be able to achieve this with her loan.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business, along with her husband's income and the money her children send, has helped her family to eat. Sometimes, when her husband is without work, he fetches the tortillas, eggs, or whatever else.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes to make the following improvements to her home: flatten the ground and install a floor. Her hopes and plans are to see her grandchildren grow up and for them to have a better life; and for her children to not suffer and to be in good health.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de Lourdes is excited about this loan because she will use it to invest. She is also nervous because sometimes she doesn't have enough money, but with God's help she is going to move forward with her business. The improvements she hopes to make in the future are as follows: to leave her children something, to expand her business, and for her children to keep working.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you for having faith in us. Thank you because we will now invest in our businesses and we hope that you will continue supporting us.\"\r\n\r\nAnenecuilco is a calm, tranquil village with a view of the hills. It is home to the Emiliano Zapata Museum, since it is where he was born. It holds some of his writings and belongings that he used, and it shows a movie about the history of General Emiliano Zapata, whose motto was: \u201cThe land belongs to those who work it.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":717393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"The following group, called \"Santa Rosa\", is located in the Ejido community of Chichilpa which belongs to the San Felipe del Progreso municipality in Mexico.  The community, one of the smallest in San Felilpe del Progreso, is very small and has few inhabitants.  The people are very kind and all know each other and get along very well.  There is no sewer system in the community so each house has to dig its own septic tank.  There are one or two grocery stores but most people raise livestock or are crop farmers.\r\n\r\nThe \"Santa Rosa\" group has eight members, five of which are men and three are women.  They are all livestock farmers and are requesting a loan for the same purpose.  They decided to call themselves \"Santa Rosa\" because that's the name of the patron saint of their church in Ejido D. Chichilpa.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Manuela is the representative of the group.  She is 51 years old and has been living in the same house for 34 years.  She has six children, five of which are married.  The other single son works and makes his own income so it's just her and her husband who live together.  Do\u00f1a Manuela raises sheep and cattle which she sells for an income.  She also has a place where she sells cakes and softdrinks.  She claims sales are down and so needs to supplement her cake sales with the income from her livestock activity.  She runs into difficulties such as fodder supply for the animals because of the current drought situation, and being able to keep the animals in a clean place so they don't get sick.  Her family depends on her business running well.  Her goal is for her cows to produce calves so she can grow her business.  With her earnings she wants to mill grass and save it for fodder for times of drought.  She also wants to make some home improvements in her bathroom and dig a septic tank, so she can improve her family's quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe names of the members in the \"Santa Rosa\" group are:\r\n\r\n1.-Manuela Cristina V.

The youngest is only two years old.  \r\n\r\nJulieta sells cosmetics by catalogue.  She decided to begin her business because she wanted to see her children get ahead and help her husband with the household expenses and school costs.  She also wanted to improve her family's lifestyle.  She will use the loan to buy more merchandise such as catalogues, lipstick, eye-shadow, blush-on, mascara, eyeliner and creams so she can offer a wider range of products.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because business is going so well.  Her sales have increased as well as her customer base. Her income has also increased satisfactorily, so much so that she wants to buy a new blender.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Julieta's goal is to continue supporting her children in their education so they can have professional careers and have a better future.  She also wants to grow her small business and expand it to include perfume and clothing.  This will allow her to offer a broader variety of products and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nShe says the group works very well since all the members have known each other for some time and they are all responsible making their payments.  The do not want to disappoint anyone who has shown confidence in them and given them this support.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the Realidad Foundation and the Kiva lenders for their unconditional support and this opportunity given the group to help improve quality of life and keep the businesses active.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the people in the group and their activities.\r\n\r\nJulieta J.

D. Tutuepec D. Melchor Ocampo municipality (in the state of Oaxaca).  The town\u2019s principal economic activities are farming and raising livestock.  This is the first group that the Fundaci\u00f3n formed in this area.  It is comprised of 11 women with different business activities.\r\n\r\nEsteL. E. M., age 32, is the representative of the group.  She attended school until high school.  She is in a common-law marriage with Gerardo Sanabia M., an excavations operator.  They have four children.  Tania is 13, EsteL. is 10, Gerardo is 8, and Luis is 3.  Tania attends high school, and EsteL. and Gerardo are in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEsteL. requested the loan to buy footwear and to buy supplies to make and sell tamales.  In the morning she works selling shoes by catalogs.  In the afternoon she sells tamales.  EsteL. says that her businesses have gone very well for her.  She has various customers.  She sells her products door to door.\r\n\r\nPaulina Gazga L\u00f3pez is a member of the group.  She is 59 years old and lives in a common-law marriage with Sebastian H. Zaguilan, a farmer.  They have nine children; all of them are married.  They only have one granddaughter under their care.  \r\n\r\nPaulina is a farmer, and she grows lemons, papayas, \u201cchio zapote\u201d (an exotic tropical fruit), corn, and beans, among others.  She says that she sells lemons the most because there is a factory in the area that processes these products to make different lemon derivatives.  That is why she has sales all year round; she sells her harvest to the factory owners. She requested the loan to buy liquid to fumigate her land and to buy water to irrigate her crops.  \r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working woman.  She and her husband grow different crops to sell.  She dreams of increasing her crops and that her crops are free from pests because this business activity feeds her family.  The earnings from her business are to support her family, especially her granddaughter.  Her granddaughter has been under her care since she was a newborn. \r\n\r\nShe is happy to belong to the Fundaci\u00f3n and that they have granted the loan.  She is grateful for the trust that they have shown in the members.\r\n\r\nThe following are the women who make up this group:\r\n\r\nPaulina G. L., age 59, buys seeds and sells fruit\r\n\r\nEmiliana M. M., age 56, buys clothing to sell \r\n\r\nMaria Cleofas C. X, age 58, buys fish and seafood to sell \r\n\r\nElva P.

The group members decided to give the group this name because the community where most of them are from is called El Limoncito as well. This description is about Mrs Mar\u00eda Lourdes L. R., who is one of the group members. She is 40, married and has 4 children - Jos\u00e9 Luis, Miguel \u00c1ngel, Adelma and Erika. Only the youngest studies (in the third year of secondary school), as the rest are married. Mar\u00eda sells meat, and has had her business for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda chose this activity as it is the best thing to sell in her community, and also because she says it is a very good source of income which helps her to continue supporting her family. Mar\u00eda will invest her loan in the purchase of more pigs and meat to continue her sales. \r\n\r\nShe says that her business has benefitted her a lot, as she is improving the quality of life for her and her family, and she can now support her husband more with the household costs and her childrens' education. She is also starting to establish a good economic situation.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's goal for her business is that she continues to invest in it, as she wants it to grow. She is thinking about constructing premises to establish a butcher's shop, to improve her earnings and in this way continue supporting her children with their studies, so that they can gave a good professional career and a better future. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that the group works very well, as all the members know each other perfectly well and are very reponsible with their repayments, and above all, are hard workers. \r\n\r\nThese are the names of the members of El Limonicito and their associated activities:\r\n\r\nLuciana R.

The group members decided to give the group this name as the district where they live goes by the same name, and all the members are from there. \r\n\r\nThis description is about Mrs Elena V. M., who is the group's representative. She is married to Felipe, who is 27, and they have 2 children - Anelis and Maricela, who both study. The oldest is in the first year of primary school and the other is in the first year of preschool. Elena has a cake shop (selling cakes, flans, jellies and desserts). \r\n\r\nElena decided to start her business as she says that there is a lot of demand. She sells from her home and generates good profits, as she also has many clients. Elena has had her business for more than 5 years. She will invest this loan in purchase more ingredients and primary materials such as butter, moulds, gelatin, baking powder, flour, eggs, yeast and some fruits, to continue making her products. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings fro her business she is saving to construct a cement wall in her house and is also helping her husband to maintain the household, although the costs aren't large as their children as still small. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that her business is benefitting many of her district's neighbours, as there aren't many people who sells this type of products nearby,  as all the shops are in the town and Elena takes advantage of the fact that some of her neighbours don't like going into the centre. As she is closer, they come to her to buy, and also because of the attention and services that she gives them. \r\n\r\nElena's dream is to one day build her own shop in her house and install a cake shop. This is her biggestdream, to improve and increase her earnings and continue to support her children with their studies and give them a secure future. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that the group members are very responsible, punctual and hard-working people, as she has known them for a long time and they get along well, as they all live in the same community. \r\n\r\nElena is very thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support that this loan has given her, as thanks to this her business is improving a lot. \r\n\r\nThe members of Lomita and their respective activities are:\r\n\r\nIrma G.

","en":"This group is called \"Las Monarcas Recuperadas\" (The Restored Monarchs), because for the members of the group, the Monarch butterfly symbolizes the \"queen\" of the butterflies.  This butterfly passes through Mexico on its annual migration, and its coloring is different from all of the others.  This group is located in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico.  It is made up of 7 members, each of them an enterprising woman with an established business.  Leonor R. is the group's treasurer.  She is 43 years old and has an elementary school education.  She has a store where she sells groceries that is located in her home, and she has had this business for 3 years.  In addition to the store, she also started up a business several months ago selling tamales from her home, with the goal of having an additional source of income.  Leonor has 2 children, aged 3 and 15, who are currently in school.  Leonor decided on her own to devote herself to an activity that would help her to obtain additional income so that she could give her family a better quality of life.  For this reason she decided to have a grocery store, and since this is a simple business it allows her to have the time to attend to her household activities without neglecting her family.  The loan that she requests will be used to purchase merchandise.

They have 11 children who are between 18 and 39 years old. Quirina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Quirina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 16,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund the operation of her bakery and fishing businesses so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and family needs. Quirina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business and \"\"Pawid or nipa\"\" making. Her husband Jesus, who is 51 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 11 and 30 years old. Alicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alicia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,300, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy fishing nets and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Alicia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari store, electronic reloading and a food vending business. Her husband Carlito, who is 49 years old, works as an electrician and plumber to earn his living. She has five children who are between 20 and 28 years old. Susan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses and savings. Susan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He drives the minivan by himself. Soleman usually works from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. If the minivan works well, Soleman is able to generate about IDR 200,000 daily. However, there are times when the minivan has problems and doesn\u2019t work well as it is quite old. This clearly affects Soleman's income, making him unable to finance his family's needs properly. In addition, since his wife is a housewife, there is no other income source for his family. \r\n\r\nTo maintain his business, Soleman really needs additional capital to replace the old and worn parts of his minivan. The main parts that he needs to replace include 4 socket breakers and machine tools. He is requesting a loan of IDR 10,000,000 from TLM.  Capital assistance will be very meaningful for Soleman in improving his

is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Quezon, Palawan. She earns her living by selling vegetables .Her husband Jose, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 6 and 19 years old, and all of them are currently going to school.  Gemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy more stock to sell and to fund farming operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of children and business expansion. Gemma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Salde, who is 44 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 10 and 18 years old. Vivian joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 29 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vivian has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 30th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Vivian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is 31 years old, single and supports her family by operating shell crafting and buying and selling of RTW businesses.  She lives in Narra, Palawan. Arlene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlene has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy raw materials for her crafts business so that she can continue to save up for the future and the improvement of her business. Arlene is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by selling vegetables, farming and operating a tricycle transport business. Her husband Warlito, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 13 and 38 years old. Ceasaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ceasaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ceasaria C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 44-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari (general) store. She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1992 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Emma is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Emma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport business. Her husband Victor, who is 30 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 4 and 9 years old. Helen Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 to buy an additional unit of motorcycle so that she can earn higher profits. Helen Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a resident of Kadamjai, a small town in the south of Kyrgyzstan.  She is 45 and unfortunately she is a widow. She has raised two sons and two daughters.  The first son went to work in Russia, the daughters are students and the second son is preschool age (under seven). \r\n\r\nIn order to earn money to meet her family's needs, Basbubu a year ago, with the initial investment of 15,000 soms, started to breed livestock animals. She resells them at the higher price after she has fattened them. In this way, she earns 4,000 soms per month. She applied for the loan because she needs money to increase the number of livestock. In the future, Basbubu hopes to expand her business and save money to support her children financially. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

C. is from the village of District 1. She is 41 years old. Salina is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Salina D. C. group.\r\n\r\nSalina is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Salina owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Salina has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Salina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Salina is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Salina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":723521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

is a married woman who lives in Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by fish vending and fishing. Her husband Mateo, who is 43 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are between 2 and 15 years old. Emma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 24 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,700, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 25th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy a freezer for her fish. She is convinced that she can continue building a second story on her house and provide higher education to all her children. Emma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a widow who lives in Bataraza, Palawan. She earns her living by selling vegetables and operating a general store. Gloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gloria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy additional vegetables and sell to the customer so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Gloria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He is 41 years old. In 1985 after the ninth grade, he entered the rural professional technical school to study tractor operations.  Three years after he finished school, he was conscripted into the Soviet military.  In 1990 after finishing his service, he moved from the city of Bishkek to the village Jeans-Alysh (in the Keminsky region of the Kirghiz republic).  There was no work in Bishkek after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but on the collective farms, tractor operators were needed.  The wages were good, and he even managed to save money and buy a small house in Orlovka (in the Keminsky region of Kyrgyzstan) where he was able to bring his young wife. For more than ten years, Mirlan worked as a day laborer working with tractors and combines, and he looked after and repaired them himself.  It was not possible for him to save money to buy his own machine.  So, Mirlan began to buy a tractor in parts: first the tractor body, then the engine and then the tractor parts.  Gradually over two years, his family\u2019s dream came true.  The day came when a tractor collected and built by the husband\u2019s hands drove off for the field for the first time.  For more than ten years now,  Mirlan has rendered services to peasants by plowing land, harrowing, and loosening the soil. Because spring is coming, Mirlan must prepare the old tractor for the season, making large repairs on the engine and replacing the oil. Mirlan has asked for a loan of 80,000 Som (KGS) from Baj-Tushum and Partners for the third time. The most important thing to Mirlan is his family: his wife and three school-aged sons.  He wants to give the children a good foundation, to send them to study in Bishkek (the capital), and to further improve their living conditions by constructing a bigger house. \r\n\r\nThe joint-stock company MFK Baj-Tushum and Partners distributes Kiva loans locally to socially-vulnerable populations. The joint-stock company MFK Baj-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading micro-financial organizations in Kyrgyzstan. Baj-Tushum and Partners is a reliable financial partner which is contributing to development of economy in the Kirghiz Republic by granting accessible micro-financial services in the countryside and cities. These services are intended to create new jobs and are expected to be in the interest of both clients and investors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":723606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Orlovka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-03-03T05:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirlan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211394249,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216458829,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221622737,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992069,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751237,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555451,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514610,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-07T02:10:51Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":278482,"name":"Modibo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Modibo D. est homme mari\u00e9 de 26 ans et p\u00e8re de 3 enfants.

She lives with her son in her own house.  She learned farming when she was very young, planting and harvesting potatoes and other crops, all thanks to her father who was a farmer.  Farming has become her main source of income now.  She plants potatoes, olluco, maize and beans because there's a lot of demand for them.  She also sells what she grows in her own shop.  She says that she likes farming because it is what she knows best, even though it requires much sacrifice.  She has to get up at dawn every day to work her fields but it's worth the effort at harvest time.  She takes her crop to market and sells to the wholesalers there who pay her with real money!  She, in turn, uses the money to provide a better quality of life for her child.  Epifania is an enterprising woman and she wants to plant more crops in the future and increase her production.  She also wants to stock her store with various products because, she says, the business is very profitable.  This is Epifania's second MFP loan.  She has a history of replaying past loans on time and she is grateful for your help.

She sells flowers from a small cart that she also uses for moving her tools.  Antonia has been in this business for eighteen years and works from 6am to 5pm.  She has many regular and long-time customers.  Her husband and her son assist her with her work.  With this loan she plans to buy more flowers, especially those that are bought for Mother\u2019s Day and Easter.  There is more demand around these dates, as indicated by increased purchases and orders.\r\n<p>\r\nAntonia dreams of having a grocery store that she can manage from her home because the flower business has run its course over the past few years.  On a personal level, this would allow her to have a more comfortable and peaceful life.  \r\n<p>\r\nAntonia lives with her husband and her 21 year old son who suffers from a disease that affects his vision and was caused by his job.  He previously worked as a welder, which resulted in glaucoma.  For this reason, he changed jobs and is now studying to pursue another profession.  This motivated Antonia to continue her business, since she wants to provide her son a better future.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor Antonia, the loans from Fondo Esperanza have been a great help to her business because they have enabled her to invest.

His biggest niche market has become national identification bracelets, which show the colors of a person\u2019s nationality in their own individual style. Indeed, his greatest success is in the unique detail and style of his jewelry line.\r\n\r\nThis is Pedro\u2019s second loan with ACCION USA. He will be purchasing more inventory in preparation for \"Carnaval de la Calle 8\" in Miami.  Like he says, Carnaval is incredibly popular and his jewelry sells like \u2018hot bread\u2019. \r\n\r\nMoving forward, Pedro wants to continue to expand his jewelry, which is already extended up the East Coast. His ultimate goal is to continue his success for both his family and business while bringing a little bit of Latin American culture to the US. \r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\n\r\nAn estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. Small businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n
