After having tried several businesses without success, she turned to selling fabrics and various other items (shoes, jewelry, etc).\r\n\r\nShe's been running this business for twelve years, and is now very well-known since she sells large amounts every month.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her customers both quantity- and quality-wise, she decided three years ago to seek help from Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\nAfter six solidarity loans (group loans), all repaid without problems, she's seeking her third personal loan. The previous two were repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy ten pieces of \"Wax\" fabric and pairs of shoes. She gets her supplies in Bamako and in Bobo (Burkina Faso), and retails  in Koutiala, for cash and on credit, to a clientele comprising both women and men.\r\n\r\nShe intends to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 70'000 (ca US$ 140), to be used to repay Soro Yiriwaso's loan and its interests, and to help with the family daily expenses.

He purchases lambs and calves in the central livestock market and raises them. Sheep raising takes about 3-4 months and cattle breeding takes 5-6 months. After fattening the animals, he resells them for a profit in the Imishli livestock bazaar. Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like <i>pilau<\/i> and <i>dolma<\/i>. His business requires a lot of physical strength and Javanshir spends most of his time in the open air. His wife helps him to feed the animals. \r\n\r\nJavanshir's monthly income is 300 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) and Javanshir wishes to increase it. As meat is in high demand, Javanshir needs more capital to put into his business to cover the market. For this purpose, he applied for a loan of 1800 AZN. He will use the loan to buy 10 sheep, two cattle and one cow.

Two years ago the opportunity arose for her to become a businesswoman when the owner of the store where she worked for so many years decided to give up the activity and put the business up for sale. Vera Christina continued working as an employee while it appeared someone was interested in buying the business. One day while she was cleaning the store's furniture, she asked God if the business was for her. She found a person who could support her financially with the initial capital so she could become the owner. This person offered to loan her the money, and she took over the business she already knew how to administer from her years of experience. She became aware of Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and decided to apply for a loan to give her more working capital so she could generate more sales and in turn improve her quality of life. She turns once again to Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, requesting financial support to strengthen her cash flow so she can purchase more merchandise (shirts, T-shirts, jeans) and take advantage of Christmas time and New Year's by offering a wider variety of products.

However, when he started to see how profitable it was and he got into a rhythm, he managed to grow in his business.\r\n\r\nWhat Edgar most likes about his work is driving through the streets as he really enjoys himself.  He has been in this line of work for two years and what he least likes about it is having to argue with some passengers who don't pay their fare.  He hopes, in the future, to buy another taxi and to work with it so that he can improve his income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Edgar's second loan from MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support.

He lives in Ica, a city that has recently had a large increase in investment, not only in agricultural exports - in other words, large farms - but also in the opening of new commercial centers that bring many jobs to regular citizens of Ica. In his free time, Mario Alberto enjoys building houses. Peru is well known for having some of the most delicious foods int he world, and one of the dishes that Mario Alberto enjoys is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" (a combination of a pasta dish and a beef or pork stew that are often served together). Mario Alberto studied until the fifth year of secondary school, and he would have liked to have studied veterinary medicine. He lives with his partner, who is the head of the household, and they have two children together. The younger child is three years old and attends an early education center; the older child is 17 years old, and he is in the fifth year of secondary school.\r\n\r\nMario Alberto is a master construction worker, always working efficiently and responsibly. He works about nine hours a day. His friends encouraged him to go into this type of work, and because of the earthquake in 2007, the need for skilled construction workers has increased.In one day, he can attend to one client, and because of the complexity of the labor involved, he is able to earn an average of 52 soles (roughly 20 USD); on a good day, he could early 100 soles (roughly 38 USD), which helps him with a few additional household expenses. His business is successful because he does his work in a responsible and honorable way, and because of this, many people comment on his good work and recommend him to others. Now, Mario Alberto hopes that Kiva lenders can help him to be able to buy more tools, and with these tools offer better service and not have to rent necessary tools. Mario Alberto will repay the loan in six months.\r\n\r\nThis improvement of having good tools will help him in his daily work, and in this way, he will be able to increase his income to improve his family's quality of life.
