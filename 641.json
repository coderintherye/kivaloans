She is married to 50 year-old Jos\u00e9 and the couple have six children.  They live together in the community of Santa Rosa Alta, in Sivia district.\r\n\r\nEmilia knows how difficult it is for a family of limited economic means to start a business from scratch.  She and her family chose to set up their own business producing grafted cacao and coffee plants.  She considers this business to be quite profitable.  There are many cacao producers in her community and so she must try to have a better production than everybody else.  The profits she has obtained from her business have given her more motivation to continue intensifying her work in this field, with the goal of providing her family with a better level of well-being.  In the future, she plans to acquire a plot of land on which she will build the home that she so longs for.\r\n\r\nThis is Emilia's second loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments.

She lives with her two children in her own house located in the Santa Rosa Alta community in the ecological district of Sivia. Froilana, upon seeing that her neighbors were earning a living in the fields, refused to fall behind.  She thus began growing cacao and coffee, products for which there is not much competition in her area.  Now it is going very well for her, and it also brings her good profits so she does not neglect her household expenses and those of her children.  She recognizes that this work requires a lot of effort, so when harvest time comes she has to hire laborers to facilitate the harvest of this produce.

Emerson had his first son at a young age and since then has had many needs. For that reason he puts a lot of effort into his farm where he grows a variety of crops such as cocoa, coffee, and palillo. After harvesting the products, he takes them to the warehouses of several businesses where he is known for the quality of his crops and where he is paid well. \r\n\r\nThe part Emerson most enjoys about his work is planting out his fields and making them fertile and productive. He\u2019s been doing this work for four years. The most difficult part is dealing with the insects that attack the flowers. For this reason he has to destroy them by using natural insecticides so that the environment is not harmed. \r\n\r\nWith the loan he is seeking, Emerson will buy bags of manure to fertilize his land and make it more productive.

He lives in his own house with his wife who is 44 years old, Fermina, and three children. When Juan was young he worked in his father's fields, but 18 years ago he acquired a 3-hectare farm planted in cacao and coffee.  His success stems from his creativity and hard work, and he has benefitted from technical training as well.  Cacao is his most sought-after crop, for the high quality he produces, and generates strong profits.  Juan generally works alone, but in times of harvest he hires day laborers on the farm to gather ripe fruit.  He plans to use this credit to hire workers in the June to November harvest period, allowing him to expand production and better his family's prospects. This is his first credit, and with the 3,000 nuevos soles he will hire workers to clear the fields and bring in the harvest.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":583.91,"image":{"id":822877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay farm workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T11:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":243.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":274.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":278.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":290.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":297.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.59,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":204.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350799,"comment":null},{"amount":77.28,"local_amount":210.78,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851159,"comment":null},{"amount":81.21,"local_amount":221.48,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":222.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666335,"comment":null},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":226.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":227.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621492,"comment":null},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":237.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835565,"comment":null},{"amount":89.17,"local_amount":243.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":243.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245325,"comment":null},{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":250.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":250.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T20:41:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":321145,"name":"Flamboyan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Flamboyan group is made up of 11 women who are neighbors in the same village in Melaya, West Bali.

He used his initial capital of 25,000 soms (KGS) to buy cattle for fattening and reselling and managed to increase the number with the monthly income of 10.000 KGS. Also, he began to cultivate a special type of potatoes, which became a very profitable business. \r\n\r\nNow Kanybek plans to use this loan of 130,000 KGS to buy a bull calf and sheep to fatten and resell.

In the afternoon, Selviyanti runs her kiosk, which is located in front of her parent\u2019s house. Sometimes her husband assists her in operating this business.\r\n\r\nSelviyanti dreams of expanding her kiosk business but she needs additional capital. She used to be in the TLM lending program for several cycles and has a good repayment record. She is now requesting a loan of 5,000,000 IDR to purchase more stock, such as snacks, beverages, bread, cake and biscuits, as demanded by the students, as well as petrol and kerosene to sell at her kiosk. She hopes TLM will approve her loan application.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":402,"image":{"id":823047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Antonio, a pastor, and is the mother of three children. By the grace of God, Sabelita has managed to support her older children's schooling up to high school level. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school, a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Sabelita as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\n\nSabelita operates a school supplies and accessories stall. She buys school supplies and other items from wholesalers and sells them by the unit for a little profit. Students are attracted to buy given the low selling prices and the many options on offer. Her regular customers are students and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP to buy more quantities and varieties of school supplies to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nSabelita dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work on her business.

However, she has never given up because of the condition of her family; she has even been motivated to start a business.\r\n\r\nAdelfina initiated a business selling rice when she graduated from high school. She purchases rice in large quantities from local farmers and resells it to retail customers at several traditional markets.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist her parents, Adelfina also sells solid palm sugar produced by her family. However, this depends on the season because the palm trees only produce liquid once a year, from April to November. \r\n\r\nAdelfina intends to increase her product quantity as rice is the staple food for the community in general. She would like to purchase one ton of rice from the supplier. Therefore, she is seeking a loan of 10,000,000 IDR. She is expecting TLM will assist her by providing a loan for the continuity of her business. She believes that she can earn more income to help her parents and to save some money for her future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.87,"image":{"id":823053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

familiar, como ranchos, v\u00edveres, bebidas abarrotes etc. Sus clientes lo reconocen y cada d\u00eda sus productos rotan mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido hasta quedarse sin existencia de algunos de ellos.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen, con ello conservar\u00eda un stock de mercanc\u00edas no perecederas,  como caf\u00e9, azucar, arroz, aceite, enlatados, refrescos y ahorrar\u00eda en precio  por la compra en volumen y tambi\u00e9n el transporte, adicionalmente teniendo productos que muy pronto terminan para no decir \u201cno hay\u201d a sus clientes. \nLuis inici\u00f3 su vida comercial hace 25 a\u00f1os  aproximadamente,  cuando proveniente de su natal zapoteca (departamento de Santander) se instal\u00f3 en la Costa caribe e inici\u00f3 como empleado de una tienda, despu\u00e9s se independiz\u00f3 en inici\u00f3 la distribuci\u00f3n de productos l\u00e1cteos en una bicicleta y agreg\u00f3 galleter\u00eda y confiter\u00eda, simult\u00e1neamente trabaj\u00f3 en tareas de la construcci\u00f3n, en una panader\u00eda hasta que recapitulando su experiencia, emprendi\u00f3 hace 7 meses su negocio de tienda con mucho \u00e9xito y por la aceptaci\u00f3n que tiene de su clientela en su nicho de mercado. Luis tien el gran apoyo de su familia especialmente de sus dos hijos, que ya construyen su experiencia empresarial en su negocio mientras estudian, por eso su mayor anhelo es dejarle alg\u00fan dia una fuente de ingreso segura y para ello debe trabajar persistentemente y con disciplina.

He lives with his wife and their four children who range in age from 12 to 18.  Housewives from the community and the surrounding areas come to his store to buy everyday items for their families such as snacks, food, beverages, groceries, and other items.  His customers know him and his products sell quickly to the point that he runs out of a few items.  For this reason he is requesting a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the funds to buy in large quantities so that he can maintain a stock of non-perishable goods such as coffee, sugar, rice, oil, canned foods, and soft drinks.  By purchasing in volume, Luis will be able to get a discount and also save on shipping costs.  In addition, by having more products in stock, he can stop saying \u201cWe\u2019ve run out\u201d to his customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuis started working approximately 25 years ago.  This native of Zapoteca, in the Department of Santander, moved to the Caribbean coast and started a job as a store clerk.  Afterwards, he became independent and started selling dairy products from a bicycle.  He also started selling candy and cookies while holding down other jobs working in construction and at a bakery so that he could gain experience.  Seven months ago, Luis opened his store with great success and a warm reception from the customers who make up his niche market.  Luis has the support of his family, especially from two of his children who have gained business experience while going to school.  His greatest wish is to one day leave them with a secure source of income so that they can work persistently and with discipline.  In the meantime, his current business is generating sales profitability of no less than 8.7% while his cost of sales is 84.1%.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":405.85,"image":{"id":822819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase non-perishable goods in bulk such as coffee, sugar, rice, oil, canned foods, and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-02T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101822},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114316},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116507},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":118740},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121016},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":123335},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125699},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":128108},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130564},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133066},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135616},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":101822,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104537.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803647,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":114316,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":117364.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614729,"comment":null},{"amount":67.96,"local_amount":116507,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T08:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":119613.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568681,"comment":null},{"amount":69.27,"local_amount":118740,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":121906.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780018,"comment":null},{"amount":70.59,"local_amount":121016,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:52Z","rounded_local_amount":124243.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188411,"comment":null},{"amount":71.95,"local_amount":123335,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126623.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324629,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T13:16:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":321354,"name":"Ta-Kar-Su Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo are members of the \u201cTa-Kar-Su\u201d group.

Because most people carry out their farming on a large scale in Western Uganda, they in most cases end up joining the lucrative food sales trade. Gard has been one of them. \r\n\r\nRukungiri is regarded as one of the leading food basket districts in Uganda. Most of the crops which people like Gard sell, principally bananas, cassava, yams, and maize are transported all the way to the country's capital, Kampala, for sale. This business has been paying dividends for many farmers from Western Uganda. Gard mostly sells bananas, cassava, and maize. He says this business despite the dividends is costly in terms of transport. Transporting foods to different food markets is expensive and it\u2019s even more costly when one wants to transport their foods to the more lucrative food markets in Kampala.\r\n\r\nGard also ekes out additional income from his goat and coffee sales businesses. Weekly he says the businesses gross profits amount to Ugandan shillings 140,000.  He intends to use this Kiva loan to purchase higher grade manure for his farms and also use the rest to pay fees for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":823326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase higher grade manure for his farms and also to pay fees for his children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-08-02T19:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenerous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kesime","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Laban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siyadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":10500000,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1750000},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1750000},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1750000},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1750000},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1750000},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1750000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1755000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227249040,"comment":null},{"amount":1334.84,"local_amount":3460700,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3470587.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868615,"comment":null},{"amount":690.16,"local_amount":1789299,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1794411.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648454,"comment":null},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1750002,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1755002.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313802,"comment":null},{"amount":675,"local_amount":1749999,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1754999,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-09T01:08:04Z","paid_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":321363,"name":"Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Basco is a 36-year-old Rwandan entrepreneur who is married with three children between the ages of 6 and 10.  \r\n\r\nFor the past nine years, he has run a butchery.

They own their own home which is built from 'rustic' building materials (adobe).  The roof is made from corrugated metal.\r\n\r\nEven when he was still a teenager, Faustino worked on his parents' land.  He also worked as a laborer on other people's farms.  He saved up some money and bought his own plot of land where he has been working independently for the past five years.  He has two hectares of land planted with coffee plants and timber-producing trees such as 'pino chuncho' (a native tree), mahogany, etc.  The key to his success lies in his creativity and his desire to work.  He uses modern technology in growing his plants because he receives periodic training from agricultural engineers.\r\n\r\nFaustino's product which is in greatest demand is his coffee beans, owing to the quality of the product that he sells.  It makes him good financial income.  Normally he works alone but during harvest times he hires laborers so that he can pick and select his product more quickly.  He will use the loan he has requested to hire laborers to support him in his harvesting and weeding.  His plan for the future is to continue expanding his production so that he can continue satisfying his customers and thereby improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is Faustino's 15th loan from MFP.

He lives near the towns of Soledad, Sabanagrande and Saint Thomas, about five kilometres from the city airport. This location has a very special social makeup; its residents are a mix of people from all over the country who come there to work independently or at the Malambo Industrial Park. PIMSA is a private housing company that provides both infrastructure and services in the area. It guarantees cost reductions to businesses that set up in the industrial park. PIMSA also guarantees these businesses have enough available local workers. This is Humberto's neighbourhood. He is a husband and father of 3 children. The youngest is only 2, and the eldest 15. He works from home selling industrial and automotive lubricants. Humberto was first exposed to this field when he worked in a lubricant warehouse. When it closed, he was able to go into business with the help of its former suppliers. He took over much of the warehouse's old business and is now able to support his family.

It\u2019s notable because formal and informal commerce interphase here along with sports and recreational venues, shopping centers, banking and residential complexes.  Most significant of all, though, this community has one of Colombia\u2019s most important sports infrastructures which very soon will become the scene of Sub 20 World Football.  Because of this, all the local merchants in the area are gearing up for the avalanche of customers that will descend on the city of Barranquilla from all parts of Colombia and from other countries.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s in this heterogeneous environment that Luz has a business where she sells beverages like beer, soft-drinks, \u201cchicha de ma\u00edz\u201d (drink made from a base of fermented corn), Pony Malta (pasteurized non-alcoholic malt beverage), ice, hot-dogs, \u201csalchipapas\u201d (fried potatoes with fried sausages) and hamburgers.  She started in 1985 because she\u2019d been a merchant since she was a very young; back in 1978 she was already a merchant.\r\n\r\nHer customers are friends, neighbors, referred people and passersby that amble through the commercial corridor where she\u2019s located.  Although her main challenge is the large amount of competition, she stays in business thanks to fair prices and thanks to her natural kindness and vocation of service that are favorable for her retaining customers.\r\n\r\nHer liquidity is twofold and her profit margin is no less than 15%.  Her goal is to gradually increase it through financing because her working capital is small and her goal now is to make it grow to increase clientele and with that, her income.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason behind her starting credit history asking Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan to buy soft-drinks, ice and baked goods.  Later on she plans to add an Internet Caf\u00e9 because she dreams with her children becoming involved and generating income through a family firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117.2,"image":{"id":823413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to

granddaughter.  Rosa has been selling tortillas for approximately two years.  She learned this trade when she was very little.  However, now she does it as the means to her livelihood.  It also allows her to help her granddaughter.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy corn and firewood.  This purchase will help her to have the necessary materials to make and sell tortillas.  The risk in this business is that the price of corn goes up, and it does not allow her to generate income.  She wants to stay in the business.  With the loan she is able to increase production and generate greater stability for her granddaughter.

Delia's work is designing and making her own clothing out of Lycra (undergarments, pants, blouses).  She has started a small but very productive workshop in her sister's house.  She tell us that some time ago she worked for a man who was a distributor in a commercial center called \u201cEl Huequito de la Ciudad\u201d (The Little Hollow in the City).  However, over time she realized that she could make her own designs, as she is very good at what she does.  This is reflected in her daily sales.  What she likes most about her work is the money flow, which generates income every day.  In addition, she has time at her disposal.  Delia is very happy with the loans she has gotten from MFP because she says that they have a very low interest rate. Delia would like, in the future, to have a bigger workshop and to contract another worker.  This is Delia's second loan with MFP.  She is awaiting more support to be able to set up her workshop with sewing machines and sergers.

She buys the merchandise from her distributors every eight days and pays her bills every 8, 15, or 30 days maximum.  Arleth has four years of experience in this business.  She started when she became unemployed.  Arleth had knocked on many doors to find work, but encountered very few options.  Therefore, she decided to start a business so that she could move her family forward.  Initially she accessed high-cost loans from informal moneylenders.  Even though she earned very little, Arleth was able to use her first experiences to build up her main customer base.  She continued to pay all of her debts and make gradual progress.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not having enough operating capital so that she can fulfill the orders from her customers in a timely manner.  For this reason, she is accessing a Kiva loan, which is her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Arleth will use the funds to buy women\u2019s and infants\u2019 accessories, as well as sweets and cookies, since these products have high sales turnover.  Her dream is to become a professional, since she is currently studying to become a dental assistant.  Arleth\u2019s dream is to become a successful person, so this is her main priority.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer profits are no less than 50% and reinvested into her business so that she can continue moving forward.  Arleth hopes to use her loan to invest in more inventory so that she can maintain her stock at an even level.  The physical infrastructure of her business is small, but adequate.  Arleth\u2019s distributors have given her good references so that she can continue to manage her business relationships.  Likewise, her neighbors appreciate the persistence in her work and speak highly of her personality and the way she conducts herself in the market as an individual and as a small entrepreneur.

Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP se siente bien con este grupo por que los problemas lo solucionan entre ellas. Con el monto solicitado, piensa comprar una red, adem\u00e1s de dar el pago inicial para comprarse un bote.\n\n","en":"\r\nDora, 45, is a very vigorous, brave woman.  She\u2019s the mother of three children but only one of them still lives with her and her husband in her house.  \r\n\r\nDora is quite dependent on the weather, especially the rainy season, to have a simple, but hard, job.  When the river\u2019s level rises she has to go out with her husband to seek out fish.  She owns four nets that are used to the maximum extent but when the season is low, just her husband goes out and she stays home doing some other activities.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this line of work for two years and has regular customers who wait for her to return to buy the food fish from her.  She enjoys working in this occupation because she\u2019s done it since childhood and even though she did other things previously she realized that this is more profitable plus she\u2019s able to work alongside her husband and sometimes even with her children.  What she dislikes about the job is having to go out into the river because this can be somewhat dangerous but like she says: \u201cwhat can one do if that\u2019s one\u2019s livelihood.\u201d  She also has two fishing boats and is planning to buy another net and another boat.\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd MFP loan.  She feels happy with this group because they solve their problems among themselves.

Percy's mornings are very arduous, since he devotes himself to many activities during the day.  His greatest inspiration is his children, to whom he wants to give a better quality of life. That is why he works hard on his farmland, where he plants peas, potatoes, and gladiolus flowers. He already has 10 years of experience in farming.  During all that time, he has been able to get a good market in the city of Tarma and in the country's capital. Depending on the demand for the product, he will travel to the place of greatest advantage to him.  As an example, in July he goes to the \"La Parada\" market located in Peru's capital, where he sells the food he produces at a good price.  He also has 2 bulls, with which he plows the land of various farmers, earning 80 soles a day in this way.  But he only provides this service during harvest time, so he would like to take greater advantage of that season.  And soon he will be able to do it, since he will buy another bull to help him with the plowing.  He also has sheep, from which he hopes to earn some extra money when he sells them.  He belongs to the \"Manantiales de Yanama\" communal bank, and this is his fifth loan with MFP.  He hopes for the support of all of you to continue with his goals. He is also thankful for the confidence placed in him.

Lucia is an exemplary woman who will not give in and wants to make the most out of life. Every day she gets up very early to have her rich milk ready to offer to her customers, who come by often because of the clean conditions and good prices she offers. She is a very positive woman who loves raising her animals and does not want to give it up since it's her primary source of income, and she calls it her favorite pastime. She plans to use this loan from Kiva partner Apoyo Integral to purchase a new milk cow that can produce at least 20 bottles a day since she currently doesn't have enough to satisfy all her customers' demands. With the cow, she hopes to be able to cover her increased demand and improve her income to give her hope for a better

Being very agile, she then immediately prepares breakfast for her children in order to send them off to school. She has done this activity for six years. Her breads are delicious and very popular. The activity that brings in the most profit is the sale of firewood. Melinda bought a lot with 100 trees that she cuts with the help of laborers. Then the wood is sold wholesale to merchants who visit her house during the weekends. She likes selling firewood a lot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require much work and it is very profitable\u201d, Melinda states. In addition, she raises small animals which are fed alfalfa daily.
