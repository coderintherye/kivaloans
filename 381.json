S. had started up a small hog fattening business when she joined ASHI in 2009. After four months of fattening, Maricel reinvested her income in the business by buying more piglets. She enjoyed spending her profit towards the needs of her three children, in addition to the income of her loving husband, a security guard. \r\n\r\nLooking beyond her present life, where her children between the ages of two and eight years old, Maricel is worried that once they will be studying in higher level of education, they will be needing a large amount of money for support. With her economic status now, she cannot afford to pay the tuition through to their graduation them from college so that they may have a better career. With that in mind, she wants to grow her hog fattening business. She wants to raise more hogs to sell: more either alive or slaughtered, after four months of raising, for a much larger amount of profit. To be able to accomplish her business desires, and her dreams for her famil,y she is requesting for a much larger amount of loan to ASHI. With the loan she is requesting, she hopes to be able to feel in her heart someday the fulfillment of being a great wife, mother and a businesswoman.

being poor, Melecia D. is very happy with her life because she has two loving children (aged 9 and 12), and a very supportive husband. Before she became a member of ASHI in 2009, she devoted her time to taking care of her children and attending to the needs of her family. She would make sure that, when her husband came home from working in the rice field all day, a meal was prepared that they would share on their small table. However, there would be times when she had nothing to prepare because her husband, being the sole provider and a hired farm laborer, had a small and sporadic income. Melecia aspired to have her own business and to play an economically productive role as well as raising children. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, with the support of her husband, she joined ASHI and requested a loan. She started a hog fattening and a rice retail business. With her business she was able to augment her husband\u2019s income and their lives have now improved a bit. Melecia is now requesting a much larger loan to really grow her business and profits. She wishes to raise more hogs and to sell large volumes of rice from their house. Someday she hopes to have enough business capital to build a store, separate from their house, where she can sell grocery items and rice to increase her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":519684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

D. is a high school graduate who sells new mobile phones and prepaid phone cards. He sells from a small stand on a street in busy downtown Monrovia, Liberia's capital. With the 71,000 Liberian dollars from this individual loan from Kiva field partner LEAP, Adolphus plans to buy more unlocked GSM mobile phones to resell.\r\n\r\nAdoplhus says he's had the business for three years now, and that business is fairly good, except towards the end of each month when potential customers run low on funds as they await payday.  He buys his phones from a Nigerian wholesaler, and says that one day he'd like to be able to import phones from China himself and sell them wholesale.\r\n\r\nAdolphus is 32 years old and married. He has two sons, aged 3 and 10. His older son is in the 4th grade. Adolphus also helps to care for his sister.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.

This is Javier\u2019s second loan with Opportunity Fund, and he will use the $4,500 to increase his inventory.

Currently, young Daniel is in charge of responsibilities that were left behind by his father, who passed away six months ago.

She lives in her husband's cousin's house with her husband and their two little children who are students at the public school. She buys and sells styrofoam cutters. She's  had this business for five years where she and her husband take these items to schools. They also travel to promote the cutters. Beatriz took out the loan to buy material to make them since she and her husband took some small classes to learn how. Now they will make and sell them as usual by traveling and taking them to schools to promote them. With the money from the loan, she will buy material to make styrofoam. Beatriz and her family are happy for the opportunity given to them since the preferential rate lowers the fee that they were going to pay and the rest will serve to buy a little more

She is a good customer who is punctual and has worked with us for a long time.  She is very responsible and hard working, and is always looking for activities that will allow her to earn a little extra money and thus improve her whole family\u2019s quality of life.  Benigna is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have given her by granting the loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva

Here we find the communal bank \"El Mirador\" which is comprised of women dreamers who are ready to make their dreams a reality, based on their efforts and sacrifices with their families. \r\n\r\nSilvia T. lives in the city of Cuenca with her 12 year-old daughter.  Her husband traveled outside the country and, in order to become a legal immigrant, divorced from Silvia 7 years ago so that he could marry there. But once legal, he forgot his family.  Now she has a new relationship in which she conceived a daughter, who is now 1 year and 7 months old.  They do not have a house so they live in a rented home.\r\n\r\n Silvia has worked as an accountant at a mechanic's shop for 5 years.  Her part time schedule allows for her to care for her niece in the afternoons while her sister studies.  In addition, she makes and mends clothing in her free time.  As she enjoys a challenge, this year she intends to enroll in a beauty class at a school in her area.  Her partner works in the art of jewelry.\r\n\r\nSilvia is in her 4th loan cycle with the communal bank.  With her first loan she bought a sewing machine.  With the other loans she received she invested in the health of her daughters who, during a period of time, were admitted to a clinic in her area.  Now with this loan she will acquire an industrial sewing machine to expand her small dressmaking workshop.

is 42 years and lives with her family in Arhangai province, Mongolia. She has a son and three daughters, ages 16 to 22. They all live together in a traditional Mongolian housing tent, called a ger. Her oldest son, Purevdaavuu studies at a religious institution in India and her three younger daughters all attend a local secondary school. During the day, Erdentungalag operates a carpentry business with the help of her husband. She started her business in 2005 with working capital of 100,000 tugrugs, and has successfully expanded her business over the years. Today her working capital exceeds 1,000,000 tugrugs. In addition to her carpentry business, Erdenetungalag also operated a sausage manufacturing business between 2008 and early 2010.

She sells from her home as well at the big market in Bougoni, retail, for cash or on credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she plans to achieve a monthly income of 75,000 West African Francs, which will  allow her to grow her business and help her husband provide for the family. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":520165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing various articles (for resale)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-07T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dhed\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961353,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913388,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476564,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751838,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917735,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83461.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360684,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T07:05:57Z","paid_date":"2011-04-17T08:23:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191250,"name":"Priyangani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Priyangani Vithanage is a 39-year-old married woman living in Nimalawa Akurassa with her two children and husband.  \r\n\r\nShe has a bicycle repair garage, a business she has been doing for 15 years now, running it independently.

","en":"The group \u201cFemmes Commer\u00e7antes\u201d (F.C.), as its name indicates, is a network of women who are active in commerce. It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month. \u00a0Beyond a membership fee, each member must pay 200 francs CFA monthly into a solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nDesiring financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one single, noble objective: to fight family poverty.

It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nFemmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 19 is presided by Mrs. Coumba G.. She is 56 years old, and has been selling vegetables for many years at the Hersent market in Thi\u00e8s. She began her commercial activities after her husband\u2019s death, 15 years ago. She is joined in this sub-group by;\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Thoro D. the treasurer, age 51, who has been selling breakfast from her home for the past ten years;\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Astou G., who is 30 years old and sells personal amenities at the market. In fact, she beautifies her clients and they pay her on a daily basis;\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Nogaye Daff\u00e9, age 52, who sells vegetables at the market of Grand Thi\u00e8s ; and\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Aminata

It\u2019s based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Mrs. Maty Niakh, the current president of the network. She had the idea to form this network after receiving training from the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. As a result, she is in charge of the group\u2019s management, entrepreneurship, etc. The members of the network are extremely devoted and meet once a month. In addition to membership fees, each member is expected to contribute 200 FCFA monthly to a solidarity fund. \r\nWishing to finance their efforts, they have decided to join U-IMCEC. As a result, their network split into 19 group of 5 people each in order to maximize profits. They are requesting a second loan for 100,000 FCFA per member, or 500,000 FCFA per group, to develop their various activities. However, contributions are paid out to the president, who is assisted by the group\u2019s treasurer, Mrs. Coumba Seck, during their monthly meetings and these two are in charge of reimbursing U-IMCEC. According to their president, this network has only a single and noble goal: fighting poverty among households. Currently, the network consists of 19 groups, each with its own president and treasurer. \r\nThe president of the Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b015 is Mrs. Nd\u00e8ye Coumba Wolette D. and the treasurer is Mrs. Mariama N..

She will use the profits to invest in her goal of owning a vehicle, which will help her continue to expand her business as well as to make her life easier.

Women\u00b4s Bank Of United Hands (Banco Mujer Manos Unidas) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The name of this group is <i>Banco Mujer Manos Unidas<\/i> which translates as \"The Women\u00b4s Bank of United Hands\". The nine women members live in the rural area of Pococ\u00ed, Lim\u00f3n, located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Opportunities for employment are scarce in Pococ\u00ed; many families rely on the production of subsistence crops and raising livestock in order to maintain their standard of living. The members of this group are involved in various productive activities including hen rearing for the production and sale of eggs, chicken rearing in order to produce quality poultry products and pig rearing in order to produce pork products. This loan will be used by each individual member to make necessary investments for the growth of their businesses to increase revenues and for the improvement of the lives of their families. The majority of this loan will be put towards the purchase of livestock and animal feed.\r\n\r\nFlor E. R. is a 39-year-old mother of four and the elected president of <i>Banco Mujer Manos Unidas<\/i>. She lives with her husband and three of her children. One of her daughters is studying Business Administration at the National University in Sarapiqui. She has one and a half years left until graduation. \r\n\r\nOn their land, Flor and her family have planted subsistence crops including rice, beans, corn and plantains, among others. At the moment, Flor is raising 20 chickens, one pig to be slaughtered and sold, and 30 hens whose eggs will later be sold. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of 40 more hens as well as nutrients and vitamins to feed them.  Flor will be able to use family-produced corn to feed her chickens, but she will need to buy special vitamins to fight off dangerous parasites which could infect the animals. Her main challenges are coping with the high costs of animal vitamins and the occasional electricity problems at home, due to the fact that Flor and her family live in a rural area, 600 meters from the nearest road. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Flor is altering her production methods in order to produce 100% organically. This method of production is favourable to Flor because she \"wants to provide a higher quality product and [she] is more comfortable eating food when [she] is conscious of the composition of all the nutrients used in its production\" (meat products, crops, fertilizers and gas). Her main goal is to increase organic production on her land and to become independently sustainable, meaning she would like to use only home grown products in production. She would also like to install a biodigester (equipment used to harness animal discharge in order to produce gas for cooking). This equipment is sometimes donated to farmers by the Costa Rican government. \r\n\r\nFlor has known the other members of her group for 8 years. She says that applying for a loan in a group is better because the women can help each other to succeed in their businesses and repay their loans. \r\n\r\nZelmira F. plans to use this loan to buy chicks and nutrients to feed them. When the chicks are ready, she will sell them and their eggs to neighbours and acquaintances in the community. Zelmira sells 12 eggs for 1000 colones (roughly $2 US). She mentions the importance of maintaining the good health of her animals in order to ensure a quality end product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":520300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"For

Celosa dreams of escaping the spiral of poverty. In 1995, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Her hope was to gain access to capital in order to start a business. She and her husband started a business making kaing (small baskets). Since then, over the course of nine loans, her business has continued to grow and provide good income for her family. However, the income from the business is not enough to sustain everyday needs. Therefore, the couple is now requesting Minerva's tenth loan in the amount of 35,000 pesos to use as working capital to start a fishing business as supplementary income. The loan will be used to pay for fish netting and a motor boat, and the remaining funds will be used to support the raw materials needed for her kaing business.\r\n\r\nMinerva is looking forward to increased demand for fish on the island and expects her secondary business to grow and generate enough income for her family. She dreams of sending her grandchildren to school all the way through college and for them to find stable livelihoods. Through her business success, she also dreams of building a home made of concrete for more comfortable living.\r\n\r\nMinerva C. is happily living with her five children and her 62-year-old husband Marcial, who is a fisherman and kaing maker in the province of

Its inhabitants are of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  There are elements of the coast, the mountains, and the plains.  This makes for special and harmonious social interactions and productivity among its inhabitants.\n\nJos\u00e9 is 28 years old, and he emigrated to the Turbaco municipality, which is ten kilometers to the east of Cartagena.  He was looking for opportunities for a college education.  In order to follow his dreams he started studying law at the university.  But, the death of his father obliged him to suspend this career because he had to work to support his family.\n\nThat is how he started working at carpentry and bricklaying.  But, these activities did not generate enough income to survive.  Looking back to his heritage, he started making products from the pre-Colombian culture.  He makes things like backpacks, hats, and fabric bags.  \n\nWith his dedication, creativity, and by studying his culture a great deal he created his own work tools for handicrafts.  He made various types of frames and a slide projector.  He uses them to make his products, which are very well received among locals and tourists.  This is because he combines the current tendencies with the pre-Colombian legacy.\n\nJos\u00e9 needs to make headway with the quality of his products because this attracts the most attention.  Therefore, he will use his current loan for the amount of  2,100,000 COP to get a serger (overlock machine) that will improve the quality.  He will also buy materials and supplies like fabric and paint.\n\nJos\u00e9 is a very supportive person, and he often does work to help his family.

conoci\u00f3 a mucha gente y le surgi\u00f3 la idea de vender ropa o prendas de vestir, realizando su mercadeo inicial mediante cat\u00e1logos. Belia hace un poco mas de 2 a\u00f1os, trabaj\u00f3 en una empresa que cerraron, y con sus ahorros construy\u00f3 un local y creo su negocio \u201cBelia Boutique\u201d cuando se fue a vivir nuevamente a San Juan Nepomuceno, lugar donde naci\u00f3 y sigue atendiendo a su clientela de Cartagena y agregando a su negocio nuevos clientes de San Juan Nepomuceno.

Su gran desaf\u00edo fue quedar desempleada y sostenerse mediante su negocio y otro de sus grandes desaf\u00edos y aprendizaje, fue la cuando hizo una oferta inicial de cr\u00e9ditos a pesonas que no conoc\u00eda y perdi\u00f3 parte de su dinero ahorrado, porque las cuentas por cobrar crecieron, pero quedaron dineros incobrables, con los que ya no cuenta;  finalmente  con esta experiencia negativa aprendi\u00f3 a ser muy cuidadosa en la selecci\u00f3n de sus clientes  y en la actualidad  eso es precisamente lo que hace elegirlos bien.\n  \n","en":"Belia G. lives with her parents and a sister in San Juan Nepomuceno in the Bol\u00edvar municipality.  She lives in a neighborhood where many of the inhabitants belong to the educational sector.  In general, the people in the community are characterized as being supportive neighbors.\r\n\r\nShe studied Hotel Administration, and she lived in Cartagena for 20 years.  She knew a lot of people there, and she got the idea to sell clothes.  She got her initial merchandise through catalogs.  A little over two years ago Belia worked for a company that closed.  She used her savings to build her place and created her business, Belia Boutique.\r\n\r\nOnce again she went to live in San Juan Nepomuceno, the place where she was born.  She continues to take care of her customers from Cartagena, and she is adding to her business with new customers from Juan Nepomuceno.  \r\nThe business has been very important to her because she is economically dependent upon it.  This is true even though she receives income from her apartment, which is rented because she lives in her parents\u2019 house.\r\n\r\nShe is currently asking for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 2,300,000 COP.  She will buy clothing and elegant footwear for women, men, and children, which has been requested by her customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her place and to later on have a car.  She would use the car to travel and bring merchandise from Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn.  Her big challenge is continuing to be unemployed and supporting herself with her business.  \r\n\r\nAnother big challenge and lesson was when she gave credit to people she did not know, and she lost part of the money she had saved.

She provides in-home services for those who want to look beautiful and healthy with the treatments she applies that don\u2019t have the time to do it themselves due to the busy schedules men and women have nowadays.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n.  She used the first one to buy work tools in order to provide excellent customer service.  She is now asking for a $2.000.000 loan with which to buy nail polish, hair dyes, hand creams and some personal use items because she knows a lot about biosecurity. \r\n\r\nHer main dream is to own her own home and she plans to associate herself with the Ciudad Bicentenario (Bicentennial City) program led by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo as part of its mission to build social development in communities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Martina plans to purchase large volumes of ingredients such as rice, sugar, potatoes and oil and to make some payments to provedors to obtain a discount in the long term. She arrived at Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 3 years ago through her daughter-in-law. She expresses that from this date on the loans have served her to expand the business because she has gone from selling empanadas and fried food from a basket to having 2 food carts to transport the food; and she has a small fridge where she bottles the chicha and oats to make the containers more hygienic. The biggest challenge of her job is that it is very exhausting: she gets up at 3.20 each morning and at 9pm each night she still hasn't finished. Martina dreams of having her own home and own place of business so that she doesn't have to go out in the streets. She also wants her son to finish studying: he has entered in various colleges but has had to quit due to exhaustion-related reasons due to the work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives in the Quillapungo sector of El Valle, located about 45 minutes outside the city of Cuenca.  Her land is fertile, which facilitates the planting of corn, beans, potatoes, vegetables, and some fruit.  She doesn\u2019t farm on a grand scale, only enough to meet local demand and supply local farmers\u2019 homes as the majority of the population goes to Cuenca to carry out various enterprises to support their families.  It\u2019s worth stressing that the women are the ones that undertake the business of raising livestock and fowl to contribute to their families\u2019 finances.  \r\n\r\nAna is married and has two children ages 13 and 12 that study at the local school.  Her husband is abroad, having traveled out of the country to seek better prospects for his family.  She is very proud to have a house of their own, for the tranquility of the family.  \r\n\r\nOur client, like most of the women in the area, dedicates herself to raising chickens and pigs that she later sells in her locality or at the Free Market of Cuenca.  She tells us that she\u2019s been carrying out this type of activity for many years, and it has served her well in allowing her to better support the family.  She also mentions that she has two cycles with her cooperative bank.  She is happy to be part of this group because of the friendships she has built with the other women members.  The loans have helped her to buy her animals and, with the current loan, she would like to buy chickens, pigs, and livestock feed.  With the rest, she will buy some basic necessities for the home.  Her greatest dream is to, one day, travel to New York to be reunited with her husband. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":520448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chickens, pigs, livestock feed, and some basic necessities for the home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-07T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Ana Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674846,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709029,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892327,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632698,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-07T22:45:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":191423,"name":"Rosiris Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosiris T.

Su sue\u00f1o es mejorar locativamente su taller e independizarlo pues funciona en su casa  y quiere repellar las paredes y instalar pisos nuevos pero sobretodo seguir reciclando bater\u00edas  viejas para el uso muchos mas veh\u00edculos que ampl\u00eden su mercado de trabajo.\n\nEl desafi\u00f3 mas grande que ha tenido y que lo marc\u00f3 significativamente,  fue cuando por el accidente dej\u00f3 de trabajar  por un tiempo y los recursos que le quedaron  de sus ahorros se los gast\u00f3,   pero hoy con su pensi\u00f3n ha logrado salir adelante  porque con ella pudo  montar su negocio.\n","en":"Wilfrido E. O., 63, lives in San Juan Nepomuceno, Bol\u00edvar department, with his wife and 7-year-old son.  He repairs and rebuilds batteries, a skill he learned 20 years ago with his nephew in the town of El Dif\u00edcil, Magdalena.\r\n\r\nHe used to work in Cartagena but a traffic accident forced him to stop working and left him without resources.  However, having learned this skill, he set up his business which, together with a small pension he receives, supports his family.\r\n\r\nWilfrido buys old batteries, takes them apart, refurbishes them, and resells them.  He also buys battery parts and builds them from scratch.\r\n\r\nHe has gotten several past loans from the foundation through communal banks but this will be his first individual loan.  He is asking for $2.000.000 to buy plates, insulators and battery casings.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to improve his workshop\u2019s location since it is currently in his home and he wants to seal the walls and install new flooring.  Above all, he wants to continue to recycle old batteries for use in many more vehicles so that his market will grow.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge, which had a huge impact on him, was when the accident forced him to stop working and he spent all his savings.  Today, thanks to his pension, he has managed to move forward because it made it possible for him to set up his business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She is 41 years old. Nanita is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNanita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Nanita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Nanita has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nanita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nanita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
