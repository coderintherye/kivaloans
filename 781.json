This is a very active city, because of the influx of tourists who come daily to see the ancient Nazca Lines.  It is also a city that is seeing increasing mining, farming and commercial activities, which are turning this area into one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the southern part of Peru.  Oscar really enjoys the Peruvian cuisine; one of his favorite dishes is the \"Lomo Saltado\" (a traditional Peruvian beef dish.)  In his free time, he really enjoys listening to music, most of all when he has a problem or is in a bad mood, because this relaxes him.  Oscar only has a 5th grade education, but he would have liked to have gotten a university degree.  Oscar is married, and with his wife he has 2 wonderful children, aged 9 and 7, who are both in elementary school.  He really adores them, and they are the driving force behind his life.  He says that without them, he would be nothing, because they are the greatest gift that God has given him.\r\n\r\nOscar works providing taxi services to the residents of his city.  He goes around the streets looking for passengers to whom he can offer his services.  He works about 8 hours a day, during which time he provides services to up to 20 passengers.  But when it is a festival day, he can service up to 50 customers.  He believes that his business is doing well because of all the effort he puts in so that he can get ahead and provide the best for his family.\r\n\r\nOscar is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because with their help he will be able to do maintenance work on his vehicle.  This will permit him to drive a safer vehicle and avoid having it malfunction.  In this way his customers will be safer and will have more confidence in using his services.

Sobhya is pictured above, at a FATEN branch.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

The loan will allow him to buy basic products such as rice, sugar, flour, beans and soft drinks to offer in his business and thus increase his sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Shawgy hopes that with the extra income that he will generate, he can offer a better quality of life to his parents and they can prosper financially, so in the future they can have the financial stability they have wished for so much.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":996229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy basic products such as rice, sugar, flour, beans and soft drinks to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-07T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-08T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shawgy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16762},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16658},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16658}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-10T11:46:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387018,"name":"Anass","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anass is a 26-year-old single man who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

She lives in Taiz, Yemen and characterizes herself as being a very hardworking hairdresser. For some time now, she has worked  in a company selling cosmetics. With the impetus of helping her family with the household income, Amal decided to open a beauty salon that would provide more generalized services related to skin health, facial aesthetics, foot care, even meditation and other services. \r\n\r\nBecause she is a professional in her field, she actually has made more profit from customers who prefer to style their hair. \r\n\r\nDue to the current bad situation in Yemen, almost all of her clients left to their villages and didn't have any interest in coming to her business when having weddings, which caused her business to stop.\r\n\r\nNow she applied for a youth loan of 100,000 Yemeni Rial (YER) from AMB. This is why she has the hope that a loan will afford her the opportunity to buy personal care products for her business like lotions, creams, shampoo and make-up, among other things, that she hopes will make her customers return. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Amal dreams that her business will continue to provide income in order to help her family with the household income, and that way, provide a better quality of life. She also dreams of having a big store where she could hire many girls who are in need of work over there. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1000115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy personal care products like lotions, creams, shampoo and make-up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-07T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-08T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":8414},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8326},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":8326}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T01:15:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389461,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora is a 35 year old married woman with four children, all of whom are in school.

He is an expert in this field, but he is unable to meet the needs of his ever increasing customer base.\r\nThis is why he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, who he is on his first individual loan with.\r\nThis first loan enables him to buy 3 gas refills, 5 driers, and 20 rods.\r\nHe buys his supplies in Bamako before selling them or offering his services either out of his workshop or by making house calls.\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to make a monthly profit of 150,000 FCFA which will be used to cover his family's expenses and pay the interest on the loan, and the rest will be invested back into his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1001565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy various items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoul Karim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T08:44:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389722,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy outfits.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T07:39:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389544,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles  is a twenty-nine-years-old man from Kisumu City, West of Kenya and is married to Rebecca.

She operates this business in the evenings, setting up a table in front of her house, where she serves all of her customers, who are mainly her neighbors, in a very friendly manner.

They have one daughter, and live in their own home which they recently managed to buy. \r\n\r\nSandy is hardworking, and has been selling ice cream for over 15 years in the town of Palmapampa. To start this business he had to work for an ice cream parlor, but with his savings he now has his own ice cream store where he has many customers. This generated jealousy from the ice cream shop where he used to work, but with a lot of perseverance he did not let it affect him. Thanks to the good service and kindness he offered, he has won the confidence and esteem of his customers.

He had been working in a perfume shop for 10 years, which is where he got most of his experience with these products. He began renting a commercial space close to his house, and he has created a strong customer base that has helped him grow his business and add copying services and cell phone minute sales. His goal down the road is to buy his own house where he can install his store. \r\n\r\nSince his customer base has grown, there are some seasons when he doesn't have enough capital to meet demand, especially in the first third of the year when he needs money to buy medicines in bulk. This is why he's accessing a Kiva loan, to make this investment and take advantage of the season, making it more probable that his investment will be successful.

He lives with his wife and 4-year-old son in their own house which they have built through hard work.  He learned his trade from an uncle who used to take him to work with him when he was a little boy.  He began working as an assistant, then decided to become independent and bought an overlock sewing machine to start his business.  He has a display point in the center of town where his wife has rented a space to offer telephone, photocopying and cell phone recharge services.  The shoe workshop is set up in his home.  Also, on weekends they sell fast food.  His wife covers a large part of the household expenses and takes care of her obligations.  With her sales, she covers operating costs and family expenses, and the additional income is for any extra payments or to make purchases.  William handles a significant stock of products and raw materials for casual shoes.  His accounts receivable have a short turnaround time and his profit margin is adequate for this type of business.  Currently he is requesting a Credikiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, in an aim to buy raw materials to make school shoes and women's shoes for the upcoming school season.

Her business is selling soft drinks and merchandise from her own home which is located in a neighborhood in the south of the city.  In her business, she sells cold drinks and small electrical appliances which people order from her.  She buys for cash and sells on credit in accordance with her customers' orders.  Right now, her growing customer base is making orders and she must first recover her portfolio (money which is in the hands of customers who pay for their merchandise through monthly or fortnightly payments) so that she is able to respond to them in a timely manner.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (the first loan she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).\r\n\r\nDiana will use her loan to buy soft drinks in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that Carnival season is approaching and this is a time when her sales increase.  She will also buy merchandise which her customers have ordered in order to enjoy Carnival such as ladies' accessories, footwear, etc.  Diana's goal for the future is to turn her business into a soft drinks store where she can also sell a variety of merchandise, in a very commercial area which is separate from her home.  While she works towards this, she maintains a return on sales (operating margin) of no less than 23% and an accounts receivable turnover of eight days.

She has a food business where she prepares and sells 'chicha' (a traditional corn-based drink), soda, juice, potatoes stuffed with meat and cheese, cheese fingers, and snacks in general.  She started her business when she realized that her mother earned good money in the same business. At first she started out selling soup and pies but gradually her work ethic and her desire to do well gave her new ideas.  Now she not only sells meals in small quantities but she also has a sales location with heated display cases and a chiller cabinet where she offers nice cold drinks. She has a lot of sales owing to the permanent warm climate of the Colombian Carribean coast.  Erica is currently applying for her first Kiva loan, which will also be her first loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.

she was in high school, Tashisia has dreamed of becoming a business woman. After much deliberation, in January 2009, she opened her own business, Personal House Cleaner, which provided high quality residential cleaning. As her business grew, she was able to employ two employees and take her business online using the domain name, www.personalhousecleaner.com. \r\n\r\nTashisia now has a steady client base, which urges her to move her business into the corporate cleaning world, as well as the residential. However, the regulations businesses hold are very strict. Tashisia would like to expand her business into this new realm, but must equip herself first.

Day after day he goes to his farm, which is located a few meters from his home, where he begins his daily labor. He owns 18 hectares (almost 44.5 acres) divided into three different types of cultivation: corn, rice and cacao. He has a good market for each product and is one of the farmers whose crops are most anticipated.  He has learned a great deal in his 30 years dedicated to this work and he continues to learn more every day, knowledge that  he is now trying to teach his children.\r\n\r\nEulogio enjoys his work because he can dedicate time to his family as well as being able to share with them what he has learned. He still remembers when he was very young, only 13, and began to help his parents in this work. Consequently he knows that being a farmer is very complex and he now wants to be able to improve his income and provide his children with a good education. He wants them to become professionals. \r\n\r\nThis will be loan no. 6 with MFP. He is very happy to know that he will have financial support because he will feel confident of succeeding in his work. He promises, once more, to make his payments on time as he has done with earlier loans. As well he is glad to be part of his communal bank because all the members are very responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the 2,500 soles requested, Eulogio will buy tools and some instruments to do maintenance on his land as well as cacao plants so he can continue planting and have a larger amount to harvest. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":998960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy tools and cacao plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-09T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-10T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulogio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T10:29:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389864,"name":"Heang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Heang is a humble farmer who has been living in Kompong Cham province.
