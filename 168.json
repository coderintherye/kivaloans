Hace varios a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s estuvo trabajando como chofer de motocarro y autom\u00f3vil, haciendo servicio de transporte interurbano en la ciudad, pero exactamente hace 2 a\u00f1os se compr\u00f3 su motocarro para realizar servicio a domicilio, este trabajo le es muy rentable, ya que al d\u00eda, descontando todos los gastos, gana entre 40 a 50 soles diarios.

Currently he is living in his in-laws home, until he can save enough money to build his own house. A few years back he worked as a motorcycle taxi and car chauffer providing intercity transport. Exactly 2 years go he purchased his own motorcycle taxi to provide a delivery service; this job is very profitable for David, given that daily, after discounting costs, he earns between 40 and 50 soles. David begins his workday at 6:00am and ends at 8:00pm. During this time of year, due to the fact that students are on vacation, it is not very profitable for him to work with his motorcycle, which leads him to believe that it would be better to rent out his motorcycle taxi until the main square improves. In the meantime he will work as a security guard at the garage of some relatives who will provide him a fixed salary. This salary and the money he will earn from renting out his motorcycle will provide him with enough to cover his expenses. David believes that if he does not work on his motor taxi the parts will breakdown, for which he sees most convenient to rent out his motor taxi until demand improves and he takes up his job again. When David requested his first loan with the Microfinanzas PRISMA bank he committed himself to pay all his quotas, and he has done so up to date when he is his sixth loan.  The money David has requested will serve to purchase a taxi operation permit from the municipality, and with the rest he will purchase tires for his vehicle. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":255131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of a taxi operation permit and tires for his motor taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T21:20:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228385,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423620,"comment":null},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116888,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011810,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595403,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989644,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":252.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210782,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T04:27:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83648,"name":"Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, de 39 a\u00f1os es padre de dos hijos, convive hace aproximadamente 13 a\u00f1os con la madre de sus hijos, tiempo en el cual pudo construir su casa en una zona alta cercana a sus campos de cultivo.

He has been living with the mother of his children for roughly 13 years, during which she has been able to build a house in the highlands near his farmland.  He has been working the land since he was very young, sowing citrus fruit and bananas.  In addition to tending his farm, he works for his neighbours who need his services to create trails for which he charges between 200 and 300 soles depending on the size of the trail,  the size of the shrubs to be removed, and the difficulty of the particular job.  At harvest time, he prepares loads of fruit to take to market, usually every two weeks or at month-end.  At other times, he harvests from 4:00 in the morning as he must take his time to prepare the loads correctly and later in the day it is intensely hot and uncomfortable to work in.  When there are buyers in the area he sells in bulk: bananas are sold in 12 kilogram loads.  He makes these preparations in April and May, when the price of bananas is better.  Citrus fruit, however, are at their peak from January to March.  Jos\u00e9 prefers to pay to have his fruit transported to the city and sell it himself because he makes more money this way than by selling to the buyers who come to the farms and pay a lower price.  This is the first loan he is asking for from MFP and he is able to pay on time as he does not want to let down the other members of his community bank who are on their sixth loan, as he is a new member.  He will use the loan to fertilize his farm, and he feels this is enough for now.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":255136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for his farms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T22:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228386,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423621,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116889,"comment":null},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011811,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595404,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989645,"comment":null},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210783,"comment":null},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":64.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T22:39:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83649,"name":"Jean Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muraho (hello) from Jean Bosco M. in Nyarugenge District, Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda!

After having done many kinds of work without success, she got initiated in this work buying and selling pasta and cassava tubers in order to make \"atti\u00e9k\u00e9\".  She learned how to do this twenty years ago from a neighbor from the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.  She works at home in the company of her friends.  Because of the quality of her products, she is in high demand by her customers, who come to buy wholesale and to sell retail.\r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy her growing customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago.  After three solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, with a women's association in her district (Association SABALY de Sanooubougou I), she is on her second PIC (a commercial individual loan).  She intends to use the loan to buy 30 sacks of cassava pasta (ti\u00e8k\u00e8doro) in Bouak\u00e9 (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) and 15 sacks of cassava in Sikasso in order to mix them to make good quality atti\u00e9k\u00e9.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her work experience in the district, she sells her merchandise to customers composed mostly of women, cash or credit accepted.  With this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":255180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy pasta and cassava root","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T06:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889543,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440330,"comment":null},{"amount":78.13,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135704,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033505,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620873,"comment":null},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019838,"comment":null},{"amount":78.11,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242602,"comment":null},{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":38366.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678128,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T11:27:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83667,"name":"Reyna Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Reyna del Carmen L.

Balitan is 50 years old. She is not married. Reyna has 3 sons whose ages are the following: her oldest son is 26 years old and works for himself; her 24 year old son is not studying; and her youngest son, who is 22, does not study. Her life partner works for himself. Her goal is to continue with her work because it is the only source of income for her family. She has to look for the daily sustenance for her family as well as for herself. She hopes to have good health so that she can continue with her work; another of her hopes is to be able to travel because she would like to see other parts of the world. Her dream is to help her family get ahead so that in the future they can take over the business and not have any difficulties resolving problems.\r\n\r\nReyna works in general sales and she sells products such as: blouses, underwear, socks, and other things. She is a street vendor and has had this business for 15 years. Reyna began this business because she has always liked to work, ever since she was young. This gave her the idea to begin a business selling gold jewelry, but over time this didn\u2019t go well for her because some customers didn\u2019t pay the debts they had with her. So, she decided to start another business and started offering products such as: new clothing, cosmetics, perfumes, and silver jewelry. She established this business and gained customers. It was difficult at first, but now things are going well. The loan is for working capital so that she can make purchases in Managua and Chinandega of the following products: lotions, perfumes, and silver jewelry. She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the organizations that give their help so that she can carry out her dreams and goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T05:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":874.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399977,"comment":null},{"amount":68.04,"local_amount":1295.92,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1359.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091975,"comment":null},{"amount":19.46,"local_amount":370.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":388.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985359,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":874.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445975,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":874.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956616,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":5833.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T18:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6120.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174044,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Her dreams are to have another business with a variety of products to offer to her customers, and also to live long enough to see this happen.\r\n\r\nFrancisca has a video game business. It is located in her house, at the following address: to the north of the Guadalupe church, 75 varas [unit of distance measurment] to the west. Francisca has had this business for 2 years. This is how she became involved in it--it came about because of the need to deal with the economic situation and because of her dwindling ability to buy basic food items. It was Francisca\u2019s children who thought of the idea. They have Playstations, Mario cars, and other video games. Most of their neighbors have children, so Francisca decided to to buy more video game equipment to start her business in her house. As time has gone by, she has become more well-known. The loan is for working capital to improve the servcies she offers and also to improve the equipment she has so that she can offer the best quality in games. These are expensive and she has to travel to Managua to purchase them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":255194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fransisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399978,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091976,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985360,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445976,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956617,"comment":null},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":1333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T23:29:38Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83672,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Sylvia Owusu is thirty-four years old.

Her husband works as a shopkeeper at a business. Leyla has the goal of improving her humble house with the income she earns because she is a determined person and likes to help her family. Her dream is to have her own business in her home, since she currently sells her products in the street. She hopes that other countries won\u2019t end their help Nicaragua because it is necessary for all Nicaraguans.\r\n\r\nShe sells general merchandise, such as: new clothing, cosmetics, and others. She sells as a street vendor. She has had this business for 7 years. She was able to begin it with a loan from a friend and later she was able to buy products with her earnings. In this way she was able to slowly build up her business. It wasn\u2019t easy to distribute her products in the beginning, but over time she gained experience in the business. When she saw that she was making a profit, she decided to invest what was necessary in the business. Her motive for requesting a loan is to buy merchandise so she can offer better products to her customers and satisfy demand. She buys the merchandise in different departments of the country, such as Managua and Chinandega.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":255211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leyla Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":714.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":785.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399979,"comment":null},{"amount":41.94,"local_amount":762.58,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":838.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091977,"comment":null},{"amount":36.63,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":732.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985361,"comment":null},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":785.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445977,"comment":null},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":785.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956618,"comment":null},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":714.29,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":785.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055568,"comment":null},{"amount":39.26,"local_amount":714.26,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":785.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T22:35:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83676,"name":"Gifty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Abena Agyekumwaa is fifty years old.

He hopes to increase the quantity of goods that he buys at each trip so as to cut down on his frequent transportation and sell to more people in his neighborhood and even beyond.<\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":255220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy provisions in bulk for her shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Nkawkaw","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.55 -0.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Obeng","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":39.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20438033,"comment":null},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":39.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27132343,"comment":null},{"amount":7.03,"local_amount":8.8,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":9.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36028883,"comment":null},{"amount":146.74,"local_amount":183.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":189.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615182,"comment":null},{"amount":30.82,"local_amount":38.53,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":39.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012328,"comment":null},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":39.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012329,"comment":null},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":39.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234400,"comment":null},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":39.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234401,"comment":null},{"amount":30.8,"local_amount":38.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":39.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234402,"comment":null},{"amount":30.76,"local_amount":38.48,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":39.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665957,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T17:24:01Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:09:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83679,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita A. is fifty-one years old.

This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her sister brought her to the Imasumac Village Bank, and her first loan was for just 300 soles (about US$100). \r\n\r\n<p>Today, Elizabeth is requesting a loan of 2000 soles to buy more plastics to sell. In the future, Elizabeth hopes to get a chance to rest. She says that her son always tells her that she shouldn\u2019t be working anymore, but she plans to keep working for as long as she can. Her goal used to be for her son to become a working professional, but now that he has become a police officer she has met this goal. She would like to see her nephew to graduate from college with a professional degree, too.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":255217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Elizabeth would like to buy plastics to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397200,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088883,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982224,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982225,"comment":null},{"amount":108.45,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":337.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442803,"comment":null},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":336.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953232,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T16:25:47Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83682,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia O. is sixty years old.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more shoes and tailoring materials in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane G.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Zaina thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more fish in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaina W.

In sports also, (i.e., for both athletics and soccer), Alhadi is proud that they always emerge victorious among all Islamic schools in Makeni town. <P>\r\n\r\nOver the years the school has grown so much that it now lacks adequate furniture and teaching materials. There are not enough benches and desks for the pupils, so they have to squeeze together. In addition to this, teaching materials like textbooks and chalk are also a constrain for this school.<P>\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the Alhadi Primary School from SMT (through Kiva). This loan will certainly be of immense help to these teachers. Since salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, and especially so for people in the teaching profession, they can not use such salaries to buy much or do anything great. But with a loan, they can now buy or do something big and then repay over a period of time. Some of them will use their share to begin or continue building a house, others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use their share to invest in business in order to complement their monthly salaries. And still others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture.<P>\r\n\r\nFatu M. K.

Home Economics Primary school in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. B.D.E.C Home Economics Primary school was founded by Mrs. Rodger K. S. to assist the children of Makeni and its environs, teaching \"the art of managing the home and thyself\". The school is staffed with twelve teachers, all of whom are female.<P>\r\n\r\nThey teach pupils who are already in classes five and six from all schools in Makeni and beyond. Each school in town will bring their pupils to B.D.E.C Home Economics on a fixed day of the week for lessons. Among the subjects they teach are: home management; child care; Family and Life Education (F.L.E.); agriculture; clothing and textiles; food and nutrition, and so on. <P>\r\n\r\nThe school is proud that pupils writing the subjects they teach always come with good grades on the National Primary School Exams (N.P.S.E). Since the school caters for pupils from all primary schools in Makeni and beyond, space has become their great challenge \u2013  they only have one building of about six classrooms. To add to their problems, the only toilet they had has been stolen. They are now looking to the government to buy them another, a process that might take donkey\u2019s years.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan B.D.EC Home Economics is borrowing from SMT (through Kiva). With this loan, they will be able to do something meaningful. Gradually, they will repay it out of their meager monthly salaries. Teachers are among the lowest paid workers in Sierra Leone, and with such small salaries, they could not do or buy anything big. With a loan, some of them can buy pieces of furniture;  some will pay either their children\u2019s school fees or pay for themselves to pursue further studies; others will use their share of the loan to either start building a house or to complete the building process; and others will use theirs in business to supplement their monthly salaries. <P>\r\n\r\nAlen F. (middle) is the head teacher of this school. Alen was born in Kamakwe, which is about fifty-five miles from Makeni. She is forty-eight years of age, married with three children. Alen will use her share of the loan to pay her children\u2019s school fees. Once this is done, it will be a great relief to her she told me, for she will not have to scratch her head again over where to get the funds to pay for them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":255340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

She is 59 years old, married, and has three children: a 33 year old son who is a bus driver, a 30 years old daughter who works as a health advocate in the hospital and a 21 years old daughter who is studying business at Hanoi University.  \nThis is Mrs. Hue's first loan from the Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women(\"FPW\"); one of her friends in Dong Thanh market, where she has a stall, recommended FPW to her.

The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\n* Mrs. Trinh Thi Hue is borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong (~ US$93) to buy kitchenware such as pots, pans, scissors, teapots, mops,thermos flasks, rice cookers, washing up liquid and chopsticks for her market stall.\n* Mrs. Ngoc is borrowing money to buy clothes for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lien is borrowing money to buy sugar, salt, towels, candies, biscuits, breads, etc. for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lam Thi Hue is borrowing money to buy bowls, dishes and spoons for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Loi is borrowing money to buy blankets, pillows and sedge mats for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lanh is borrowing money to buy bread for resale on the street in the early morning.\n\n","en":"<br><i>Note: original loan description is in English.<\/i><br>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":255520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bowls, dishes, blankets, pillows, clothes...","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Viet Nam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T16:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ng\u1ecdc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Li\u00ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u1ee3i","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398716,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090643,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984010,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44444663,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955275,"comment":null},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63172626,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T17:22:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83767,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cI will never stop dreaming big for my children.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of Thanh Hoa province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam. It is located approximately 150 kilometers south of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luong is the lead borrower of the group. She is 34 years old, married, and has two children, both of whom are at school: a 10 year old son and a 6 year old daughter.\r\n\r\nThis is Mrs. Luong's first loan from the Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (\"FPW\").  She will use the proceeds from her loan to buy clothes for her market stall.  \r\n\r\nShe buys women's clothes in the Vuon Hoa market and sells them in the Dong Thanh market.

bank loan with Mrs. Khorn S. elected as the village bank president. She owns a small store where she sells grocery items to her local customers. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand and decided to ask for a loan to buy more grocery products for her inventory. She is a 42-year-old widow with a child who is a laborer and is also going to marry soon. Thus, Mrs. Khorn S. is going to have a big happiness party in her family. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Twenty members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows thE. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and a default rate of 0% with

Today, the ploughing business is the main source of income for her family with an income of 3,000,000 VND per month.\r\n\r\nThis loan cycle, she hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND to fix the plough and

This is 41-year-old Neema M. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 5 and 16. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because her parents cannot take care of him. \r\n<P>\r\nNeema has been running a kuku business since 1995. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are kuku, you may ask. Kuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons:\r\n<P>\r\nFirst, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally. Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Neema currently earns about 150 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375 USD in order to expand her kuku business and buy a cow for milk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business.  Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand her kuku business and buy a cow for milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema E.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":255671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase 50 bags of rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica J\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436367,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130639,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027436,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613437,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010517,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232813,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T02:29:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83815,"name":"Zakhid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zakhid A., age 40, lives with his wife and one son in the city of Bilasuvar, situated in the southern part of Azerbaijan.

This is 23-year-old Neema N. N. from Tukuyu. She is married with one one-year-old child. Neema has been running a timber business since 2005. Her business is to purchase timber from villages and resell it in town.\r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Neema currently earns about 50 USD a month from her business. She is requesting this loan in order to purchase more timber in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase timber in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema N.

is a 27-year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife and their child. Mohammad has owned a bakery for seven years. Mohammad has an oven, and he sells <EM>mankoucheh<\/EM>. He is known for his good and very tasty mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza. The most common toppings are <EM>zaatar<\/EM> (thyme), <EM>jebneh<\/EM> (cheese) and <EM>lahm bi ajin<\/EM> (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. Mohammad requested a loan of 1000 US dollars from Al Majmoua (Kiva's Field Partner) in order to purchase flour, pay school tuition, and pay off his debts.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

When she first joined, she only borrowed money to invest in raising animals, but in 1998 she boldly took a loan to invest in a new business selling dry goods.  During her 13 years of membership in the Fund, the financial situation of her family has steadily improved.  In 2007, she opened another shop on the same model in order to provide a livelihood for her son.  Currently, the total family income is 5,000,000 VND (292 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, Mrs. Kho\u00e1i hopes to borrow 15,000,000 (875 USD) to buy dry goods and other foodstuffs that will meet the needs of local residents during the lunar new year holiday.<br

At first, Mrs. D. used her loans only to raise animals.  Then, in 2000, she made the bold decision to use a loan to open a restaurant.  Today, both she and her husband work in their restaurant, which has become their main source of income, earning them about 5,000,000 VND (292 USD) per month. In the next lending cycle, Mrs. D. hopes to borrow 15,000,000 VND (875 USD) to invest in her restaurant and also in raising animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

This is 28-year-old Scola M. from Tukuyu. She is married with two  children aged five and nine. Scola has been running a genge business since 2005. The Swahili word for a small outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Scola currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375 USD in order to purchase more rice, maize flour, beans, cooking oil and sugar in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of items she carries. Scola thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice, maize flour, beans, cooking oil and sugar in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Scola B.

This is 30-year-old Ester M. from Tukuyu. She is married with three children between the ages of 6 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because her parents cannot take care of her. \r\n\r\nEster has been running a business selling crops since 1997. Her business is to purchase maize, beans, rice and wheat from villages and sell them in town at higher price. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Ester currently earns about 300USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more maize, rice, wheat and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Ester thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more

This is 31-year-old Naomi D. from Mbeya. She is married with two children aged two and four. Naomi has been running a genge business since 1997. The Swahili word for a small outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Naomi currently earns about 30 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375 USD in order to purchase more onions, tomatoes, rice and fish in bulk. Naomi thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Josephine D. from Dar es Salaam. She is widowed with two children between the ages of 4 and 6 years. Josephine has been running a clothes selling business since 2005. Her business is to buy clothes wholesale and sell them on a retail basis.  She works at the business for 8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Josephine currently earns about 400 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 750 USD in order to purchase additional stock of clothes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Josephine thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

This is 50-year-old Ester N. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children between the ages of 20 and 31 years. Ester has been running a poultry (kuku) business since 2005. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.  She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Ester currently earns about 250 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375 USD in order to purchase additional chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches.

Diana thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase wheat and maize flour, cooking oil, and rice.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Norah currently earns about 200 USD from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":255861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The members dream of buying more farmland, building their houses with better construction materials, and growing their businesses. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":255877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for seed, fertilizer, agricultural supplements, labor costs, sugar, rice, and to rent farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T00:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenobia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yovana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Dionisia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifacio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5250,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":883.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397222,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":883.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088920,"comment":null},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":883.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982247,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":883.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442825,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":883.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953254,"comment":null},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":883.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63170589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T11:41:19Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83921,"name":"Neida Martina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DO\u00d1A MARTINA QUE CUENTA CON 35 A\u00d1OS VIVE EN SU PROPIA CASA UBICADA EN LA COMUNIDAD DE AZUZAQUI, JUNTO A SU ESPOSO DE 40 Y SUS 5 HIJOS DE 3-7-15-17 Y 19 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This is 48-year-old Christina M. from Tukuyu. She is single and has four children between the ages of 16 and 20. Christina has run a food-selling business since 1992. She buys her goods from local farmers and sells them in nearby villages. She works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, seven days a week, with help from her children. Christina currently earns about $370 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to purchase ten bags of maize, three bags of groundnuts and two bags of beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of the goods she has for sale. Christina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ten bags of maize, three bags of groundnuts and two bags of beans in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina M.

from Tanzania! This is 60-year-old Fatuma A. P. from Dar es Salaam. She is widowed with four children between the ages 16 and 45.  Fatuma has made a living running a cafe since 2004. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour) and plantain (a cooked savory banana), served with beans, vegetables, meat and a variety of sauces.\r\n<p>\r\nFatuma works at her business for 9-12 hours a day, seven days a week. She currently earns about $400 a month from her business, and is requesting a loan of $750 to buy sugar, rice, maize flour and beans. In the future, she plans to renovate her business.  Fatuma thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sugar,

Despite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country, it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general--not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids and vendors. It can be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines, followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.\r\n\r\nMaria works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, 7 days a week and gets help from her husband. Maria currently earns about $300 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to buy more phone accessories such as phone cases, batteries and chargers to resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Maria thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more phone accessories such as ases, batteries and chargers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria P.

This is 65-year-old Felista M. from Tukuyu. She is married and has four children who are between the ages of 30 and 42. Felista has been selling mobile phones since 2003. Despite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country, it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general--not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids and street vendors. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines, followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine hours a day, six days a week. Felista currently earns about $375 a month from her business. She is seeking a loan of $375 to buy additional phones. In the future, she plans to further increase both the number and types of phones she sells. Felista thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This is 36-year-old Joyce M. from Tukuyu. She is a widow with two children, ages 10 and 20. Joyce has made a living selling clothes since 2002. She buys her clothing wholesale and sells it retail to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for eight hours a day, six days a week, earning about $140 a month. She is requesting a loan of $375 to buy additional clothing to sell to her customers. In the future, she plans to open another business selling shoes. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy additional clothing to sell to her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T17:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce J.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Lucy T. is 53 years old and she is from Tukuyu. She is divorced with 2 children, who are 26 and 30. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant, who is an orphan.  \r\n\r\nLucy has earned a living running a charcoal business since 1995. These small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth provide a good way of life for charcoal sellers, and are crucial to those who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots to cook, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford.\r\n\r\nLucy works at her business 8 hours per day, 7 days per week. Lucy currently earns about $500 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $325 USD in order to purchase additional stock of charcoal. In the future, she plans to increase the amount of charcoal she sells and open another store.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":255958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase additional stock of charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy H.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! Elizabeth R. is 33 years old and from Mwanza. She is married with three children, who are between the ages of 4 and 16. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant who is an orphan. \r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth runs a tailoring business. She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, primarily for women. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business for eight hours per day, six days per week. Elizabeth currently earns about $100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to buy one tailoring machine, and more materials for making clothes. In the future, she plans to open another store. Elizabeth thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy one tailoring machine, and materials for making clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436410,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130682,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027479,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613480,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010559,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232854,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664658,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105389,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022534,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T14:39:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83964,"name":"Carolina Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO \"CAROLINA\" ESTA REPRESENTADO POR LA SE\u00d1ORA CINTHIA PAOLA Y CONFORMAN 13 SOCIAS DE LAS CUALES 11 SON MUJERES Y 2 HOMBRES, TODAS ELLAS SE CONOCEN ENTRE SI YA QUE RESIDEN EN EL MISMO BARRIO, EN SU MAYOR\u00cdA SE DEDICAN A ACTIVIDADES COMERCIALES COMO LA VENTA DE ROPA, ABARROTES EN TIENDAS DE BARRIO, VENTA DE COMIDA AMBULANTE, A LA ELABORACI\u00d3N DE PAN, AL SERVICIO DE LIMPIEZA Y A LA VENTA DE LICORES.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more cosmetics to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436411,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130683,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027480,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613481,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010560,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T11:50:26Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83967,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MARIO TIENE 45 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, ES SOLTERO, TIENE 2 HIJOS DE 25 Y 23 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD. \nLA VIVIENDA EN LA QUE HABITA ACTUALMENTE ES ALQUILADA.

Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. (Kuku means chicken in Swahili.) Raising chickens to sell is popular for a number of reasons. First, it requires little start-up capital. You can start with one or two chickens and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, the chickens require little space, so you can let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while the chickens grow, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten. Liku has been in business since 2006 and her business has been doing well. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works at her business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week. She is assisted by two employees.

Additionally she wishes to leave them with housing where they can live with dignity.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Pastora Alarc\u00f3n runs a bookstore where she offers products such as: notebooks, pencils, erasers, pens and cards.  Her business is located in Telica and she has run the business for 10 years.  She began her business in order to have another source of income, which helped her and her daughters to have a better life and security.  When she began her business it was with her own small amount of capital that she invested in small things such as rulers, bags and markers but with only these things she could not satisfy the demand of her customers.  Recently she has decided that a loan would help her to make all of the necessary purchases of school supplies for the peak time in sales and take advantage of the need for her products.\r\n<br

When she first joined the Fund, her family depended on raising animals and growing crops for their income.  Today, in addition to raising animals, Mrs. N\u0103m also buys beans and peanuts in bulk from local farmers and sells them to consumers, and her husband works as a hired laborer.  With their current income of about 3,500,000 VND per month, the financial condition of her family is steadily becoming more secure.  In the next round of lending, Mrs. N\u0103m hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (575 USD) to invest in her business selling beans and peanuts.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert

Victoria M. is 27 years old and she is from Tukuyu. She is married with 3  children, who are between the ages of 3 and 10. Victoria has been running a business selling clothes and shoes since 2006. She sells them to her customers through her retail store. \r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business 4 hours per day, 2 days per week. Victoria currently earns about $100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase 200 pairs of shoes and 100 pieces of cloth for her business. In the future, she plans to open another store and increase the quantity and range of inventory that she sells. Victoria  thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

This is 38-year-old Maria M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children, between the ages of 9 and 13. Maria has been running a \"kuku\" business since 2004.  Raising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about \"kuku\". <P>\r\n\r\nWho or what are \"kuku\", you may ask. \"Kuku\" means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons.  Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising \"kuku\" is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.<P>\r\n\r\nMaria works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her husband. Maria currently earns about 70 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 450 USD in order to purchase more chickens (\"kuku\") for re-selling. In the future, she plans to open another business. Maria thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

Rahima has regular customers for her dressmaking business.  At the time of her first loan, Rahima only had one cow, but today she has two cows and five sheep.

This is 29 years old Neem M. from Tukuyu.  She is married with three children between the ages of three and 10 years old.  \r\n\r\nNeem has been running a genge business since 2005.  The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge.  A genge is a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish.  It is the kind of place local people send their children to fetch ingredients when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and do not have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, seven days per week.  Neem currently earns about $60 USD a month from her business.  She is requesting a loan of $ 400 USD in order to purchase sugar, rice and soaps in bulk.  Neem thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Vahshad region. He is 22 years old and despite a young age has six years experience in the animal husbandry. He buys young calves, feeds them and then resells on the market. All this process takes about 50 days. This business provides good income, and at this time due to winter the prices for cattle have fallen and he wants to get a loan to buy calves at a cheaper price. In the spring he will be able to sell them and make profit. He will pay off the loan within 12 months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mrs. Nalin P. was elected the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables, but her field is infertile. Thus, Mrs. Nalin P. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer, vegetable seed, and a piglet for breeding. She hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions with this loan. She is a 26-year-old widow and the mother of a child who is attending the local school. \r\n\r\nTen members in this group will receive end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest will have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term but is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

is the village bank president. She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables. Her husband, Mr. S. Rom, is a palm juice collector who gathers juice to process into palm sugar or wine. He now wants to expand his business, and so Mrs. Ny E. decided to ask for a loan to buy more containers for the palm juice. She is 52 years old and the mother of two children who are enrolled in the local school.  \r\n\t\r\nTwelve members in this group will receive End-of-Term (EoT) loans and the rest will have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term but is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Cambodia. The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mrs. Yalin U. was selected by the members to be the village bank president. She is a housewife. Her husband, Mr. Muon Sophea, is a construction worker. Mrs. Yalin U. is requesting a loan to add to her savings to build a new house for her family. She is 48 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory, another is a farmer, and the youngest attends the local school.     \r\n\r\nThree members in this group will receive End-of-Term (EoT) loans and the rest will have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term B. is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Chhnang province, Cambodia, have formed a village bank loan group and Mrs. Chan Soy P. is the village bank president. She owns a small restaurant where she sells rice soup as a breakfast food to the villagers. In addition, she is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice, but she does not have rice seed. In order to solve this problem, Mrs. Chan Soy P. decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. She is a 55-year-old widow with four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while the others attend the local school. \r\n\r\nTen members in this group loans will receive End-of-Term (EoT) loans and the rest will have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term but is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Thus, Mr. Pech K. decided to request a loan to buy three more piglets for breeding. He hopes to increase their income and improve their living conditions with this loan. He is 42 years old and the father of three children who are enrolled in the local school.\r\n\r\nAll the members in this group loan will receive End-of-Term loans.  In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term but is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

The members plan to use their loan for various purposes. Mrs. Savong H. was selected by the group members to be the village bank president. She sells vegetables in the village market. Her husband, Mr. Phorn Thean, is a construction worker and a fisherman, but he does not have enough fishnets to increase his catch. Thus, Mrs. Savong H. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets for her husband. She hopes to increase their income and improve their living conditions with this loan. She is 48 years old and the mother of six children, four of whom are employed in a garment factory while the others are enrolled in the local school.            \r\n\r\nTwo members in this group loans will receive End-of-Term (EoT) loans and the rest will have monthly payment loans. In EoT loans, payment on principal is not required until the very end of the loan term but is allowed at any time that the borrower is able to make such a payment. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Most clients start to make principal payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

This is 39-year-old Dinah E M. from Dar es Salaam. She is divorced with two children aged 15 and 20 years old. Dinah has been running an African traditional clothes business since 2008. She makes and sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\n\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week. Dinah currently earns about 250 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase cloth and dye for making batik. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Dinah thanks you for your support.\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":256218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To

This is 47-year-old Rose I. from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has three children between the ages of 18 and 28.  Rose has been running a  genge (grocery store) since 2004. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood and a tin roof where people can buy general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nRose works at the business for 9-12 hours a day, 6 days a week. She currently earns about $400 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $925 USD to purchase rice, maize, and beans. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her inventory. Rose thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This situation leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

businesses are a flourishing business in Azerbaijan for the simple reasons that all people have lunch out of their offices and men of Azerbaijan like to spend time in caf\u00e9s in the evenings. Azad has been running his cafe in the small village of Sabirabad for the past five years. He is a cook and finished a special cookery college course.  He began his own stall with his hard-earned savings, as he had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. Slowly, he began to understand what people want to eat and now his menu consists of only five meals but they are most popular. Azad is a father of three young children who are in school.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":256208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To purchase more maize, rice and sunflower seeds in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T23:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436426,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130698,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027495,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613496,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010575,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":119166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232866,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T00:42:40Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84129,"name":"Alvaro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1lvaro tiene una movilidad que trabaja como taxi.

This 51-year-old Neema M. from Mbeya. She is married with 6 children, between the ages of 26  and 32. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two  dependents because they are orphans. <P>\r\n\r\nNeema has been running a \u201cmachinga\u201d  business selling used clothing,  mitumba (cheap second-hand clothing), vitenge (traditional Tanzanian clothing) and shoes since 2006. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. \r\n\r\nThese second-hand clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything western or modern. Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.<P>\r\n\r\nNeema works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Neema currently earns about 20 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 475 USD in order to purchase more shoes and clothes for her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":256310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more used shoes and clothes for her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T23:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436427,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130699,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027496,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613497,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010576,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T00:22:58Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84133,"name":"Husein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Husein is a 49 year old man who lives in the Bekaa, Lebanon, with his wife and their four children.\r\n\r\nHusein has been working as a taxi van driver for seven years.

Rosa is asking for this loan amount in order to rent a new location for her restaurant and also to purchase furniture to create its atmosphere.<p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ines Teles, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":256317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Renting of a location for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T21:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228395,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423630,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116898,"comment":null},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011820,"comment":null},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595413,"comment":null},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":168.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989654,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T00:02:36Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":84137,"name":"Celestina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestina is a member of the Yanapanakusun Village Bank. \u201cYanapanakusun\u201d means \u201cLet\u2019s help ourselves\u201d in Quechua, the first language of many of the group members.

She has been a farmer for 20 years, growing crops native to her area, such as potato and corn.  This has sustained her family as she sells her harvest at market.  In previous years, this was a good way to make a living but lately, because of weather conditions, she has noticed a sharp drop in her revenues.  Margina has therefore decided to sow alfalfa, which is used to feed animals as it is more profitable to harvest it often and sell by bales.  As part of her plans, she intends to start a business raising small animals at home.  This is the first time Margina is getting a loan from MFP. She is committed to pay on time, which is why she has been accepted as a member of her community bank.
