She started her business after her daughter was born and the family needed more money. First, she worked for someone else selling clothing, but then her friend suggested that she start working for herself. Being a hard-working and determined person Ruslana has made this business a success. Now she plans to increase her business and open a second kiosk. This business is the only source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nRusland would like to get a loan for $875 to purchase children jackets, hats and other clothing. The additional inventory will help her to increase the variety of goods and serve to her clients even better. The income she earns would help her to pay for her daughter's school and fix up their house so they can have better living conditions.

She has a baby apparel factory. Ever since she was young, Margarita has been in retail. Her first business was herbal remedy sales. She also assisted in delivering babies. She started a chicken farm as well, but because she had no experience in that line of work, things did not go well and all her chickens died. <p>\r\nShe kept working hard, and with the help of her husband, was able to purchase 3 cows, which will soon have their own young.  This is why she is very happy. She also notes that she did not have an opportunity to provide her children with an education, which is why they, along with their dad, went to work at a sweater factory four years ago. As a consequence, they started learning skills and obtaining experience, which is how the idea to purchase a knitting machine to make baby outfits was born. One of her children currently helps her manage the business, and he can now study. Her youngest son now attends school as well. She dreams of being able to build her own house and of seeing her children get an education so that they can be upright professionals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":233787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase supplies to make sweaters and baby apparel ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecp\u00e1n, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-12-09T08:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124,"local_amount":930,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":942.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855552,"comment":null},{"amount":76,"local_amount":570,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":577.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395042,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086841,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:47:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980410,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441213,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169010,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-20T08:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594332,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029803,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-20T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110796900,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123903637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T15:46:26Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:54:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":77699,"name":"Mirna Haydee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna es casada y tiene 3 hijos, ya solo una esta estudiando y vive con su padre.

Now she is applying for a loan to buy mason's tools for her husband. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of several more members from her locality. Khamir baji wants a loan to buy seeds to re-sell. Ameeran baji wants a loan to buy tools for agriculture. Allah Jeevai baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk-selling business. Kaneeza baji wants a loan to buy a donkey cart for delivering loads. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":234011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy

She is 28 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is attending the local school while the remaining two are too young to work or study. \r\n\r\nShe is a farmer who owns a small piece of land that she uses to cultivate rice to earn a living. On this plantation, she usually collects rice revenue every January.

With God's help he has become an excellent supplier of vegetables for his community.  He is responsible for four people (a wife and three children) and earns his family's living with his farming.  He knows all the ins and outs of this business, in which he has 5 years of experience.  His great trump is his production of vegetables in the off-season; however, in order to accomplish this, he needs investment for purchasing seeds and mineral fertilizer.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 1500 Somoni ($450 USD) so as to supply enough to meet the demand.  This will allow him to better provide for his family.

Each day, he takes his cows to graze in the far reaches of his fields. \r\n\r\n<p>With these activities, he earns income to support the living expenses of his family. He faces difficult times, however, when livestock prices go down and he is not able to earn enough. Ergashali, however, is learning every day how to run his business for the best end result. The constant motivation for his efforts is his family. He is accustomed to these tasks since he has carried them out as he himself grew up. Ergashali seeks a loan for working capital, specifically so he can buy cattle, especially considering that the prices for them are low now. He feels that this is the only way that will enable him to provide all of his children with a good education. Ergashali deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.

Since that first loan, she has taken out three other loans and is now seeking her fifth. She has increased the size of her school and can now afford to start saving money while also helping many kids get a quality education. The best part is she is able to teach all her children, and hopefully help them have a better future and get out of their poverty.

She took out a small loan and started a business selling flowers and now wants to take out her sixth loan! She has always paid each of her loan payments on time, and has slowly grown her business with each loan. She now earns enough money to take care of her children and have them all in school. She also feels useful to her husband and knows that she has a purpose each day. She is so happy with the way her business is going and loves having something of her own. She and her husband are living more comfortably and finally can save some money to send their children to college. They pray that someday their children will have a good, comfortable life.

1945 and lives in the Utanskoya mountains in a rural kishlak (village). He has eight children.  Two of his sons have gone to work in Russia, but their wives remain.  M. provides for his family and his daughters-in-law, even though his sons send money to live off of.  The primary occupation in the village is farming.  M. works in farming as well, but at the end of autumn, he is unemployed.  Because of this, every family, including M.\u2019s, raises livestock, since livestock provide both food and warmth.   He keeps cows for milk and other dairy products, and he has a lot of goats and sheep who give wool.  In the winter when livestock is cheap, he buys goats or sheep. However, this time he did not have enough money to increase his herds. His relatives advised him to go to MicroInvest, since they themselves had taken out loans in the past.  Now, having received the necessary funds, M. will get sheep and goats at the next market.  In three to four months, the lambs and kids will grow up, and he will be able to sell them for a profit in order to pay off the loan and buy more livestock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":234533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T22:30:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamdamov","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":807.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015724,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":807.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599461,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T06:17:30Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":77995,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sonia lives in district 8 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

","en":"Mansur O. was born in 1959, is a widower, and has three children.  His youngest son lives with him.  Mansur makes a living making dental molds for dentists.  He has a drill which he keeps with a dentist he knows.  He is also a master at doing repair work.  However, his primary occupation is keeping cattle.  He began raising cattle in his youth.  His corral has three calves.   All last summer it had six calves.  His daughter, who does not live far away, came and looked after the calves to help her father.  After fattening them, he sold the six bulls and used the money to buy a car for his son.  At the end of autumn, the price for cattle has fallen.  Therefore, he approached MicroInvest in order to buy another pair of calves to fatten and sell in season for a profit. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":234539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T22:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mansur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":643.87},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.41},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":689.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.16},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.16,"local_amount":643.87,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":657.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015725,"comment":null},{"amount":199.92,"local_amount":666.41,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":680.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599462,"comment":null},{"amount":206.92,"local_amount":689.72,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":703.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T01:26:44Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":77998,"name":"Fiz\u00e9tou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame A.

With this initial loan of 450,000 francs CFA she is requesting, she will round out her inventory of merchandise with 10 sacks of rice, 10 containers of oil, 6 boxes of tomatoes, and 7 boxes of spaghetti.  The expansion of her commerce will enable her to cover her family's expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She will use the money to repair her cart and to buy more produce to increase the number of dishes she can sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":234644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Repair cart and increase food sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T20:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957806,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228056,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423288,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116544,"comment":null},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011487,"comment":null},{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":143.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T23:31:04Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78063,"name":"Yudy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yudy tiene 33 a\u00f1os, vive con su pareja y sus hijos Yesica de 14, Dami\u00e1n de 12, Diego de 10 y Adriana de 6.

Baptist was founded in September 1984 by the Baptist Mission. It has a total of 449 pupils currently enrolled in the school and a total of thirteen staff. Baptist Primary School always prides itself on its good results on the National Primary Schools Exams (NPSE). In 2004, for example, they produced the one student with the best testing results in the entire district.This is Baptist\u2019s first loan with SMT.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. The use of the loan varies amongst the teachers.  Some of the staff members will start a small business.  Those who are already small business owners will invest the loan into their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture for their domiciles and others plan to pay either for their children\u2019s education or to pursue further studies themselves. \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them, engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (though this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system\r\n\r\nFifty-three year old David E. T. (right) is the head teacher at the Baptist School.  David was born in Makama in Makeni City. He is married with seven children \u2013 one in primary school, four in secondary school, one in college and the oldest is an adult working for a living.

They sell their wares from home, in the marketplace, and on foot, making door-to-door deliveries. \r\n\r\nJulia, N\u00e9lida, Carmen, Yusly and Maritza are five of the 21 group members. \r\n\r\nJulia is a 53-year-old widow with two children.

N\u00e9lida and her husband sell cleaning products, which they sell in the stores of the Ayacuchan jungle towns.

She plans to use her loan to buy tables and chairs for the small restaurant she plans to open.\r\n\r\nYusly is 21 years old and lives with her common-law husband and their 3-year-old son. She sells haberdashery like necklaces and earrings, which she buys wholesale in the markets of Ayacucho City. She is using this loan to start anew: Yusly and her husband lost a lot of money when his household appliance stO. was robbed three months ago. Yusly thought about leaving FINCA, since she didn\u2019t think she would have the money to keep making loan payments. Instead, she\u2019s decided to stay in the group, but to start over with a small loan of 300 soles.\r\n\r\nMaritza is single and 21 years old. She and her sister run a ceviche restaurant, which they just recently opened. She used to run a small stand, but now the restaurant has moved into a mO. central location. She plans to use her loan to buy television spots to promote her restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe women are requesting different loan amounts (300, 450 or 600 soles) and the group as a whole is requesting a total of 12,000 soles. They will use their loans to buy vegetables, pasta, sugar, fruits, cookies, and animals. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":234682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy vegetables, pasta, sugar, fruits, cookies, tables and chairs, TV ads and animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T05:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Concevida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yusly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Klelia Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida Nere","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":975},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":975},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":975},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215186,"comment":null},{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396899,"comment":null},{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088576,"comment":null},{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981979,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-23T00:58:01Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:05:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78086,"name":"Juan Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nJuan Jim\u00e9nez es originario del municipio de Condega en la ciudad de Estel\u00ed donde se dedica arduamente a su actividad agr\u00edcola destac\u00e1ndose en la siembra de hortalizas como lo es tomates y chiltomas.

Kear L. is a farmer in Prey Mlou village in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. She owns a piece of land on which she cultivates rice during the wet season, but she can earn little rice revenue to support her family. She now wants to also cultivate rice during the dry season. Thus, she decided to request a loan to buy rice seed, fertilizer, and pesticides to kill insects. She hopes to increase her rice revenue to provide better conditions for her household. Her husband, Mr. Suot Thorn, is a construction worker. Mrs. Kear L. is 40 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom attends the local school. Another child stays at home to do housework and the others are too young to work or study. Her husband is shown in the photo.

Fourteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.
