S., who lives in Barangay 2, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, is 46 years old and married to Loreto S., who helps her in running their business, especially her carinderia or restaurant. They are blessed with two adult children who are 25 and 27 years old. Their children are already finished with their college studies, having taken Commerce & Criminology courses.\r\n\r\nIt is a great benefit for couples to send their children to school and enable them to finish their studies. It takes dedication, hard work and helping each other to achieve their dreams. It also takes the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon to help them succeed as entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nLooking back to before they started and where they are now, the couple dreamed of sending their two children to school and putting up their own business, one that would grow progressively. That\u2019s why, to put their dream into effect, they started a very small oyster-breeding (talabahan) business and a little restaurant at their home.\r\n\r\nThe couple still continues their businesses because, even with a small income, it still helps the family. But then the demands of the household and school expenses were increasing and, if they stayed at the same income, it would not be enough for them to sustain their needs. That\u2019s why, in June 2005, Elizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have added capital for her existing business.\r\n\r\nElizabeth continued her loans until such time as she totally improved their businesses: for her oyster-breeding she was able to widen the area, and her restaurant has also expanded. In addition to this, she started pig-raising as an additional source of income. In fact they earn Php 10,000 per month, a big help to the couple in sending their children to college and in continuing to expand their businesses. During this time, Elizabeth maintained her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, Elizabeth borrowed Php 29,500 as additional capital for her businesses. The loan was, as usual, fully repaid on time and without any delays. She wishes to borrow the same amount of Php 29,500 for her 19th loan. This amount will be used for her restaurant and pig-raising businesses.\r\n\r\nThe couple is very happy because their dreams are successfully achieved. Now, Elizabeth continues with her loans and with her businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

He has five children, but the youngest is already 28 and all have moved out of his home, where he lives with his wife. This is Miguel\u2019s first individual loan, and his seventh loan overall with Esperanza. He is excited for the responsibility of having an individual loan, and is thankful for the opportunity this loan will provide. Miguel runs a colmado in his neighborhood, which is a small corner store that can sell anything from juices to laundry detergent. Miguel sells juice, rice, beans, flour, household items, and even makes sandwiches in his colmado. \r\n\r\nMiguel dreams to one day own his home, eventually allowing him to leave something behind for his children. With an individual loan, Miguel is now solely responsible for the outcome of his finances.

He and his wife work in the production of raw milk and also grow onion, corn and alfalfa seeds for their dairy cows to eat.\r\nMr. Ricardo owns his own house but it is of very basic construction and doesn\u2019t have all the modern conveniences.  He has 6 children ages 19, 16, 14, 12, 8 and 3.  The oldest has only finished secondary school; he would like to study a trade but doesn\u2019t currently have the economic resources.  In the meantime, he is working as an assistant in a mechanic shop.  The other children are in a primary school 5km away from the home.\r\nThe loan would be intended for the purchase of dairy cows to increase milk production.  This will allow for a growth in revenue and an improvement in the standard of living for the whole family.  Mr. Ricardo\u2019s dream is to see all his children in a profession so that they may have a better standard of living.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emma Felten, Kiva

S. is from the village of Calube, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. She is 49 years old. Josephine is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine operates a business selling home products. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and other basic needs in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 1,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from the village of Salawagan, Quezon, Bukidnon. She is 32 years old. Ruby is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Ruby owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Ruby has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruby joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruby has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Ruby is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Ruby from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is from the village of Tabo-o, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental. She is 52 years old. Niza is married and has 4 adult aged children. To make a living, Niza owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying & selling fish in the local community. Niza has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Niza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Niza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. Niza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Niza from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

D. P. is from the village of Tabuan, Tukuran Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 25 years old. Metchelie is married and has 1 infant. To make a living, Metchelie runs a transportation service. The main source of income for the business comes from operating a motorcycle in the community. Metchelie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Metchelie joined GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Metchelie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to buy tires and accessories. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Metchelie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":411400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Heddy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. Heddy is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Heddy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Marianne borrowed additional capital from ASKI to acquire those products which she sells to her neighbors and friends. According to her, she is able to earn a net income of Php 4,000 a month which she adds to her husband's income to acquire their daily needs and pay her weekly amortization.\r\n\r\nSince her business is profitable, Marianne wants to continue it and to acquire additional items. When she paid back her first loan, she applied again, requesting an amount of Php 10,000 to be used in acquiring the said additional items.

C. is married to Mr. Joel C. of Poblacion, Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya. She is a responsible housewife who aims to improve their standard of living so that they can give their child a better future. Despite the hardships and difficulties of life, the couple still have strong faith and determination to achieve their goal. They believe that hard work and sacrifice will lead to progress and are therefore doing their best to earn more income for their child's future, and for their future children as well. \r\n<p>\r\nOne means of earning income for the couple is barbecue and cup cake vending in their village. In addition, Jocelyn's husband sometimes does construction work. As a fruit of their patience and labor, they are now earning a net weekly income of 700 PHP from their small business. Since their weekly income is not sufficient for the needs of the family, it is important to increase their income. For this reason, Jocelyn wants to borrow additional capital of 5,000 PHP from Kiva partner ASKI to improve their small business. She is very confident that, with this financial assistance, she will be able to improve her business and increase their income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":410868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In this regard, Charlita engaged in selling vegetables and fruit in their village. She sells them through house to house delivery and also to the market through retail. Every week, she earns a net income of Php 700 which they utilize to acquire their daily basic needs and for the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nSince her weekly income is not sufficient for the needs of the family, Charlita wants to sell more vegetables to earn a higher income. In this regard, she wants to borrow additional capital of Php 5,000 from ASKI to be used in acquiring more products for her vending business.

Maria is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from GDMPC.

C. is a 30 year-old mother to two children (ages six and seven) in the village of Sitio San Juan Brgy Caradioan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Her husband is a pastor in their local community church. As a mother, she dreams of giving her children a brighter future, of sending them to school and helping them finish their studies, and of uplifting her family's living. She also wants to help her husband defray household expenses.\r\n\r\nTo address these things and prepare for the future, Rema decided to start her own business so she can make an income to support her dreams in life. That's why in January 2004 she became an entrepreneur and joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan Rema started a general store to have an easy income and the fast turnover of her capital. She was very happy because her earnings helped meet the needs of her children and family. Her loan and business grew for 3 years, when she started other businesses like the load retailer (phone cards), selling gasoline, and networking of Avon Products. These businesses are a big help for her family. She was able to earn 3000 PHP per month. Now she says that her businesses are a big contribution toward achieving her dreams.\r\n\r\nRema used her previous loan of 18000 PHP as additional working capital for her general store. She paid on a weekly basis and it was fully paid in full and on time. Now she will use her 8th cycle loan of 19000 PHP for her general store and other businesses. She will save the additional income for the education of her children.\r\n<em>\r\nAbout NWTF<\/em>\r\n<br> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":411441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

B. is from the village of Sta. Filomena. She is 48 years old, married, and has 4 children. The first three are adult-aged while the youngest is school-aged.  To make a living, Febe owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The primary source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Febe has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Febe joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Febe is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Febe from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and to support the education of her youngest child. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":411698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Flavia, the leader of this lending group, makes chicken feed. At the moment, all Flavia\u2019s children are out of school but she helps to take care of some orphans. She is a hardworking lady. \r\n<p>\r\nFlavia makes chicken feed from fresh animal blood, shells and bones. She employs people to go to Lufula slaughterhouses to collect the fresh blood in cans. She boils this with ingredients from Ugachick Poultry Breeders Limited in Gayaza, as an independent producer. Once done, she sells to Ugachick itself, although the payments take two weeks to come through. This is one reason she also sells to other firms that pay instant cash for her to remain in business. \r\n<p>\r\n Her previous loan helped her renovate her recently built house and now she needs a loan to help buy more raw materials for her business. She also wants to put a concrete floor in her house to get rid of the dust. She is very grateful for her previous loans and those to come.

She has been running this business for twenty-one years and hoping to expand to a bigger store. Tenneh started with LD18,000 that was given to her by her late husband, and has been taking her business very seriously, because it is the only means of income for her and her children. She has been facing theft problems, but because she develops good relationships with her customers, their numbers increase day by day.\r\n<p>\r\nTenneh needs this loan to purchase more goods to improve her business.

Sumini doesn\u2019t pay for transportation costs to and from shopping because she works in the same market where she does her shopping. On average she receives 40 customers a day.

Sumini uses public transport to and from home to work. Her challenges include defaulters and the ever-increasing prices of baking powder and cooking oil. \r\n<p>\r\nSumini wants to use this loan to buy more baking powder and jerrycans of cooking oil.

He is able to earn a monthly profit of around $90.\r\n\r\nThis will be Frederick\u2019s fifth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. With his previous loans, Frederick was able to expand his business from one office to two, and he has repaid all previous loans successfully.  He hopes to use this loan to invest in new TVs to sell at his business, and also to buy more used TVs and radios from Zanzibar. He travels to Zanzibar two times a year to buy more items to sell. Frederick hopes to use his extra profits from this expansion in his business to help his family with the household expenses and to save for the future. Frederick says his life has changed a lot because of micro-loans from Tujijenge. Where he used to only be able to buy one or two parts for a TV at a time, he can now invest in several at one time.\r\n\t\r\nFrederick will share this loan with his loan group, Mrangirangi (meaning \u201cmany colors\u201d in Swahili), which totals 17 members. The members of the group will receive loans for a variety of businesses that include tailoring shops, carpentry services, food vending, and \u201ctable top\u201d stands where fresh fruit and vegetables are sold. The group members will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans.

He lives in a nucleus family with his wife and only child in the ATTBOUGOU neighborhood of Segou town( fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Having abandoned school in the ninth basic year (Malian education system) owing to family reasons( parents very poor), he began an income generating business by becoming a marketing  agent of a shopkeeper in the area. After several years spent besides this shopkeeper, he decided to develop alone, opting for the clothing business which he operates 2 years ago. He has great name and reputation thanks to his sense of business and above all, his enthusiasm. With the intention to expand his wrking capital in order to make more profits, he turns toward the micro-finance institution Siro Yiriwaso for his first individual loan. He intends to use this amount to buy 15 pieces of different styles of quality wax cloth. He gets his supplies right from wholesalers from the big market of Segou.

A batey is a community built by sugar companies for their workers, and they are synonymous with poverty. La Plaza lacks running water, any kind of reliable electricity, and is a great distance from the nearest medical facility. In addition, Bethania lives in a crowded home made of only thin wood panels. She has three children (6, 5, and 4 years old) and lives with her mother and brother.\r\n\r\nThis is Bethania\u2019s first loan with Esperanza International. Other borrowers in her community expressed their satisfaction with Esperanza, and Bethania decided a new loan would be great for her business. Bethania makes and sells underwear for the women and children in her community. She expects that the loan will help her business expand greatly.

They live in large traditional families and they average 61 years of age and 4 children. They live in the Djaka (Kirango) district of Markala (the 4th administrative region of Mali: Segou).  They know each other through family, marriage, and through neighbours. They carry out the same business to generate revenues, all surrounding fish and in all forms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group was organized through a fish processing cooperative started out by Anpe (National Employment Angecy).  They have all received training on various hygiene techniques provided by BIT (International Work Bureau). They are have two modern ovens and dryers to their disposal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After having successfully repaid 4 past loans, the group is requesting their 5th loan which is to be used to purchase 80 baskets of fish and 100 blocks of ice. They purchase fresh fish along the Niger River, sort them, and keep a good portion of them to be dried. \r\nThe fresh fish is sold at Segou (in the Chateau market), Bamako, Koutiala, and Sikasso. The dried fish is mostly sold in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango and Segou, though they keep a portion to sell in the fall when they can earn more money. Smoked fish is mostly sold in Segou. Sales are generally completed in cash and credit to a clientele made up of men and women.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They hope in producing a monthly revenue of 80 FCFA which will help increase the volume of their sales, and to satisfy the needs of their family (including clothing, soaps, and petroleum).

The youngest is the reason for her efforts and work since she supports him economically in his efforts to become a professional.  She, along with 9 other equally hard-working persons from the Comas district, make up the \u201cAMISTAD Y LUCHA\u201d (FRIENDSHIP & STRUGGLE) group.\r\nEsther sells clothing and accessories door-to-door and tells us that since childhood she has always been attracted to sales.  When she was able to gather a little money she began selling clothing accessories to her girlfriends and little by little began to amass a bit of capital which she then invested in the purchase of clothing.  She feels satisfied because, with her business, from a very early age, she was able to help support her parents, buy her items, and help her husband with the expense of educating their children thereby insuring that they would have a profession.  Today, her work's purpose is to support her youngest child who is a university student and, when she travels to the countryside where she also sells her merchandise, she takes advantage of the opportunity to get to know a bit more of her country.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":411977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Marilu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lily Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene Eliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6350,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1058.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1058.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":1058.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780212,"comment":null},{"amount":371.3,"local_amount":1059.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669081,"comment":null},{"amount":371.07,"local_amount":1059,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064539,"comment":null},{"amount":370.72,"local_amount":1058,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899604,"comment":null},{"amount":370.37,"local_amount":1057,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933694,"comment":null},{"amount":370.71,"local_amount":1058,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661315,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T21:41:10Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":146691,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan B.

Previously he lived in Lima with his 4 children, but his wife was involved in an automobile accident, which killed one of his sons and rendered his wife gravely ill.  Thanks to his work as a carpenter he was able to forge ahead and move his family to the city of Ica.  He is a hardworking person, and with great effort has purchased the tools necessary for his work.  Currently his wife helps him by selling snacks in the areas surrounding his neighborhood.  With their income they are providing their daughter, who is dependent on them, with a better education.  He is requesting a loan to install a water tank in his home, as this year they\u2019ve had problems with their drinking water service, as well as to purchase lumber so he can build a fence around his carpentry shop and keep his tools and equipment secure.  His dream is for his daughter to become a professional and for his carpentry shop to grow.  Mr. \u00c1lvarez is grateful for the support we can provide him so his business can prosper, thus improving his quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maya Wisnievitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":412093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2009-10-23T22:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romulo Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":104.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":109.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":111.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":114.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":121.42},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":121.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":134.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":142.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":146.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.3},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.59,"local_amount":104.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769439,"comment":null},{"amount":38.23,"local_amount":109.21,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":109.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110658247,"comment":null},{"amount":79.03,"local_amount":225.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":226.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123889191,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":121.42,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":121.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923008,"comment":null},{"amount":42.68,"local_amount":121.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T07:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":122.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137225608,"comment":null},{"amount":44.3,"local_amount":126.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-19T08:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":126.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145159777,"comment":null},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":690.49,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-04T07:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":691.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155654900,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T02:23:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-04T07:35:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":146705,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  ROSA MARIA R.

F. is from the village of Southern Looc.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Vencita has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, Vencita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vencita successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Vencita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Vencita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
