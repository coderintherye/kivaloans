Each dedicates herself to different economic activities. Delmir, age 28, started her food-selling business with her own money more than 10 years ago. Since she started her business, she has begun to sell food to local machinists and has expanded her business to other areas. In contrast, her other friend Martha, age 54, has sold bread for 25 years and with the necessary help, she has been able to muster the necessary effort to make every day better. For these reasons they seek more funds to buy raw materials for each of their activities. They dream that they will have sufficient capital to make some improvements to their home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Halea Meese, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":548556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Operating Capital\/ Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-06-07T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delmir Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.79,"local_amount":718.1,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":718.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761719,"comment":null},{"amount":37.33,"local_amount":793.35,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":793.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848688,"comment":null},{"amount":35.9,"local_amount":762.77,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":762.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256627,"comment":null},{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":814.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":814.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802627,"comment":null},{"amount":254.64,"local_amount":5411,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5412.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956460,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T15:50:44Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205037,"name":"Esperanza Y Fe Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena is the coordinator of her group, Esperanza y Fe (Hope and Faith), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s group is located in La Romana, a rural area of the country dedicated to the sugarcane harvest, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable.

The members live in a community having the same name as their communal bank, in the parish of Turi.  Turi is located south of the city of Cuenca, and is bordered on the north by Cuenca, on the east by the parish of Valle, on the south by the perish of Tarqui, and on the west by the Parish of Ba\u00f1os.  The central parish is located 200 meters from the city of Cuenca, and it is considered a great vantage point where locals and tourists come to enjoy the lovely panoramic view of the third most important city in Ecuador.  The perish church and the hill of Hitocruz are other locations which are very popular with tourists.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we were accompanied by a friend of one of our members who is interested in learning about the program offered by Espoir [the field partner].  From left to right, she is the lady with the green hat and the red shawl on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nMrs. Adriana D. lives in the community Corazon de Turi, and this is her first loan in the program.  She discovered the program while attending a course on knitting and crafts.  She raises animals like lambs, pigs, cuyes [guinea pigs; sometimes raised for their meat in parts of Latin America], chickens, and cows for milk.  She will sell half the milk in the community, and keep the rest for herself.  She has already been doing this for about 5 years.\r\n\r\nAdriana is 23 years old, married, and has two children, ages 4 and 1.  Her husband is a mason.  They don't yet have a house of their own, so they are living in the home of her husbands Grandmother, keeping her company.  She will use the loan money to purchase chickens to raise, and materials to construct a shed where she can raise more cuyes.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to someday own a house of her own.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johanna Z. lives in the community Corazon de Turi, she's 22 years old, married, and she and her husband have a 4 year old son.  She is also five months pregnant with their second child.  Her husband works as a mason.  They live in the home of his parents, (sharing all the expenses with them) until they own a house of their own, which is their biggest dream.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan, and like most women in her community, she raises pigs and chickens, some of which she sells to her neighbors in her community, and the rest are consumed by her household.  With the money she receives, she will purchase a pig, and the food to raise it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aaron Cannon, Kiva

She lives in her own home along with her husband Artemio, 54, and their three minor children for whom she wishes to provide a better quality of life. Domitila works in the cultivation of coffee and bananas. Every day, very early in the morning, she works in her field, knowing that the money she obtains for her products will depend heavily on the quality of her harvest. She sells her products in Pichanaki, where better prices are offered. What she enjoys most about her work is the harvest, since it is then that she feels that the months of labor have come to fruition. She has worked in this business for three years and the most challenging part of her work is fumigating her land as the chemicals are damaging to her health. In time she hopes to buy new land and in this way increase her production. This is her second loan with MFP. She feels that this contribution will help her greatly in the progress of her work. In her Communal Bank she is deeply loved by the rest of the members, since she is highly supportive of them. With the 2,000 soles she is requesting, she will buy more natural and chemical fertilizers to improve the quality of her land. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":548593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase natural and chemical fertilizers to improve the quality of the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-08T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326755,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T04:08:56Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205055,"name":"Santos Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Santos Javier G. esta agradecido por su cooperaci\u00f3n en el cr\u00e9dito anterior el cual pudo construir la barda alrededor de su vivienda.\nEsta nuevamente solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para los acabados de interior de la cocina de su casa. \nPlanea pagar el cr\u00e9dito con el ingreso que obtiene de su trabajo como chofer de un cami\u00f3n de carga  de una compa\u00f1\u00eda de trasporte.\nLa persona que aparece en la foto es la se\u00f1ora Cynthia Aurora Barba esposa del se\u00f1or Santos Javier ya que el se encontraba en su trabajo el d\u00eda de la visita a si vivienda. \n","en":"Santos Javier Guzman is grateful for your support of his previous loan with which he was able to build a fence around his home.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for his business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Antonino has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns close to 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Antonino joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonino has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Antonino is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Antonino from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

J. is 32 years old and resides in San Pedro Masahuat, which is located in the Department of La Paz.  She sells coconuts, bottled water, juices, and other beverages.  Sonia is a responsible and hardworking woman who lives with her three school-age children (ages 16, 14, and 8).  Her vending post is located along the highway on the way to the airport in El Salvador.  Most of her customers are Salvadorans who arrive from abroad and take advantage of the delicious coconut water.  Sonia also sells to people traveling to Zacatecoluca and other nearby towns.  Her sales are fairly stable since people traveling to the airport are accompanied by their large families and find it necessary to stop in order to buy her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nSonia is requesting a loan so that she will have the necessary funds to buy coconuts in bulk.  She will also purchase more water and soft drinks so that she can increase her sales.  Sonia is a hardworking person who strives each day to provide her three children everything they need.

a mother, Iluminada\u2019s biggest dreams are always for her children and family. She wants to provide her children with a decent life. In 2000, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have access to capital for the maintenance of her businesses. Her previous loans from ASHI were carefully utilized as additional rolling working capital for her tricycle (three-wheeled-vehicle) transport business and for operating a passenger jeepney (a small bus). The businesses are a big help for the family in covering their expenses and allow them to set aside savings for the future. She is requesting a loan of PhP 45,000 to pay for a renewal of city plates (LTO-Land Transportation Office-registration) and purchase spare parts for the maintenance of their tricycle and jeepney. \r\n\r\nIluminada hopes that her business will become successful someday. Along with the business success she is dreaming about, is the hope to see the graduation of her four children from college and to see them find a good job. She also dreams of having a store selling poultry feed someday to save for her family\u2019s future. Iluminada wants to thank ASHI and Kiva lenders who are sponsoring this loan. That is one of the greatest opportunities for her to start reaching for her goals.\r\n\r\nIluminada C. comes from Antipolo, Rizal province, in the Philippines. She is a 43-year-old woman, married, and is the mother of four children. For her age, Iluminada is seen as strong and determined to improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":548687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

She is a member of the Upper Buhanginan center in Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) Rizal West Branch. She is a very strong-minded woman, and she remarks that she works hard to better her status in life. \r\n\r\nDespite hardships brought about by poverty, Ma. Elena remains strong and dedicated in her pursuit to improve her family\u2019s standard of living. The love and support of her husband makes her life quite significant. To make a living, she operates a sari-sari (variety) store. She has been engaged in this business for more than seven years. \r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI, a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2006. During the course of her membership, she has been an excellent performer with respect to her credit rating (basis of loans).

Prior to obtaining this footing in her current business, she was a milk-seller. She used the proceeds from her milk-sales business to start up this secondhand shoe business, with the help of a loan.\r\n\r\nWith a steady profit inflow, principally the 60,000 shillings she makes in a week, Jalia has managed to educate all her children. With this loan, her sense of optimism is sky-high, especially knowing that she will be able to purchase more shoes to sell. This, in the long run, will mean her profits will also increase.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":547940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more secondhand shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fulujensio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jumah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mefia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2300000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":143750},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":143750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":580636.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662524,"comment":null},{"amount":169.62,"local_amount":380600,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":384330.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689302,"comment":null},{"amount":314.86,"local_amount":706525,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":713450.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903459,"comment":null},{"amount":86.66,"local_amount":194450,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":196355.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296934,"comment":null},{"amount":88.22,"local_amount":197950,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":199890.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467794,"comment":null},{"amount":109.39,"local_amount":245475,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":247881.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182606006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T14:37:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205106,"name":"Jackielyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackielyn D., 28, is from the village of Christine, District 1, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is married and has two infant-aged children. To make a living, Jackielyn owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a retail and wholesale of \"chicharon\" (deep- fried pork rinds). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crispy fried pork rind in the local community. \r\n\r\nJackielyn has been engaged in her business for over one year. She also has a direct selling business for almost three years. Both these businesses earn her around 6,000 PHP a month. She hopes that Kiva lenders will continue to support her throughout her fourth loan cycle.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jackielyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jackielyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jackielyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives in a polygamous family in the Hamdallaye district of the Koutiala Prefecture (Sikasso Region).\r\n\r\nMrs.  Traor\u00e9  did not have an opportunity to go to school, and this is why she had started learning trade skills from her mother from an early age on. After many years of training, she decided to specialize in the preparation of traditional homemade soaps, which she has been doing on her own for over 20 years now.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet her customers\u2019 expectations as to both quantity and quality,  Kassipin lost no time in getting in touch with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, which she joined 3 years ago. After four solidarity (group) loans, all duly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan. The previous individual loans have also been properly repaid. This loan will allow her to purchase in Koutiala five barrels of cooking oil waste needed to make soap. She sells her wares in different quarters of Koutiala to a customer base composed of women and men, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to achieve a monthly income of 85,000 West African Francs, which she will use to repay the interest on her loan, contribute to the everyday family expenses and reinvest the rest in her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":548736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchasing food oil waste","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-03T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kassipin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961596,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699717,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913619,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180755,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476724,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613434,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751888,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606137,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917771,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":36120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360716,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T01:24:46Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205139,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This entrepreneur is 26 years old and single.

G., age 40, is from the village of Rang-Ayan. She and her husband have three school-aged children. To make a living, Marilou runs a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marilou joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Marilou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marilou is now requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items, with the goal of expanding her store's product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Marilou from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

R., 45, lives in Kompong Tom Province where she has had a medium-sized plot of farmland since she was single. She grows rice and has two crops per year, in both the dry and rainy seasons. To find additional income, she built a pigpen behind her house where she raises hogs and sells them when they mature.

With the support of this loan, she sees herself restocking her plastics-selling shop with items like basins, jerry cans and buckets.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":548289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more plastics like basins, jerry cans and buckets for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pross","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5400000,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":337500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":337500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1352106.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662530,"comment":null},{"amount":609.41,"local_amount":1343200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1345295.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689307,"comment":null},{"amount":712.64,"local_amount":1570725,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1573175.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903465,"comment":null},{"amount":515.45,"local_amount":1136075,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1137847.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T23:30:28Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205178,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Being single and the sole provider of her 44-year-old mother and 15-year-old niece, Merlita M. has enjoyed being productive as a woman.

By working hard in her seaweed buy and sell business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

She has been in this business for four years now and enjoys a large customer base and great recognition.\r\n\r\nWith plans to address customer demand, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 54 months. After three solidarity loans and three individual loans, all repaid, she is on her fourth individual loan. She plans on using it for buying 50 meters of <i>riche<\/i> damask fabrics and 10 bolts of wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth). She stocks up locally in S\u00e9gou. Accepting cash or credit, she sells to a customer base composed of women and men.\r\n\r\nMinata hopes to make a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA that will enable her to meet certain expenses (paying the electricity bill, soap, and medicines). Her ambition is to build a house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":548857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buying clothing to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-03T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699720,"comment":null},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913621,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180758,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476726,"comment":null},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613437,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751890,"comment":null},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606139,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917772,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360718,"comment":null},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226099,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":46214.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T21:32:33Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205182,"name":"Rokiatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame  Rokiatou C. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 28 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re 4 enfants.

He makes and repairs doors, windows etc. for cash for a customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan he hopes to make a monthly profit of 35,000FCFA, of which part will be used to pay the rent on his workshop and to pay an apprentice, while the rest will be saved, since his ambition is to have the complete amount of equipment necessary for his business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":548863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase of equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Loulouni Kadiolo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-02T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50835.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961598,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":50835.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699722,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50835.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913623,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":50835.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180760,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50835.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476728,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T01:41:53Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205184,"name":"Hamidou Ousmane","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 le 19 Octobre 1988 \u00e0 Z\u00e9goua (fronti\u00e8re Mali-C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), Monsieur Hamidou Ousmane Dram\u00e9 est un c\u00e9libataire r\u00e9sidant dans une famille traditionnelle \u00e9largie \u00e0 Sanoubougou II, un des  quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nHamidou Ousmane n\u2019ayant pas eu la chance de progresser dans les \u00e9tudes s\u2019est tr\u00e8s vite initi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 d\u2019achat et vente de t\u00e9l\u00e9phones portables et de leurs accessoires (fa\u00e7ade, batterie, chargeur, \u00e9couteur,etc.) il y a environ dix ans. \nSon activit\u00e9 est men\u00e9e dans une boutique \u00e0 la gare routi\u00e8re de Sikasso avec une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e essentiellement des voyageurs et surtout de transporteurs. \nIl est beaucoup sollicit\u00e9 de sa client\u00e8le pour la qualit\u00e9 de ses produits. \nDans le souci de mieux satisfaire sa client\u00e8le de plus en plus croissante, Il d\u00e9cida d\u2019int\u00e9grer l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso il y a quelque mois.

She left school at the secondary level and learned hairdressing. She has worked in this trade for three years now. At the same time, she sells hair extensions, cloth and cosmetics in her beauty parlor.

Only 1 of her children lives at home, in the house Alberta owns. The rest of her children are older and independent. Although they are always trying to look after her, Alberta likes working because it makes her feel alive. At a young age she learned how to farm from her parents, so she has also taught farming methods to her children. They help her with the daily tasks involved in growing coffee, bananas, and avocados. \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work and all the experience she gains in the countryside. When Alberta wants to speed up her operations she hires workers so that she can rest a bit without slowing down her work. Alberta is characterized by her prudence, managing to prevent infection of her crops by common pests and diseases. She is convinced that a good harvest depends mostly on the work put into it. \r\n\r\nAlberta considers her work to be fairly profitable because she has been able to acquire many goods, educate her children, and above all provide a good quality of life for her family. In the future, she plans to set up a business selling food from home. Many people have already suggested she do this, because her home is in a good location for the business. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and she is happy to continue working with her group because it is made up of good, supportive and responsible individuals like herself.

She is a single mother of three children, with whom she lives in her mother's cozy home.  Things were difficult at first when her partner left her, but nevertheless, her priority was for her children to get ahead in life.  This is why she set up a grocery store in her house a year and a half ago.  Now she works there alone, without help from anyone.  Since then, she has learned to allocate her time well, attending to her customers, whose company she enjoys very much anyways.  On the other hand, it is uncomfortable for her to transport products to her store because the journey is very long and cumbersome.  But this does not deter her.  She dreams of growing her store in the future and also hopes to build her own house in the same area, because she doesn't want to move far away from her mother.  She would also like to develop the land that her parents inherited, where she thinks she would plant bananas and coffee -- very profitable products in the area that are also in high demand.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that she has a loan with Microfinanzas Prisma (MFP) and she is showing herself to be very enthusiastic and attentive to the decisions agreed upon by the members of her community bank.

G. is a 41-year old married woman who lives in Calumpang, Barangay Mabini, Valladolid, Negros Occidental.

Two of the children are adult aged while the other child is currently going to school and also helps the parents in the business as part of daily chores.\r\n\r\nNema joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nNema is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP10,000 was used to fund operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 10th cycle loan, the amount of PHP13,000, which she intends to use on her general store business. Nema is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Without capital, Amelia\u2019s business will not grow and she will not be able to provide suitable services to her customers.

F. is from the village of San Rafael.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Romelia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,200 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Romelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Romelia is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the product range. This will be the sixth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is from the village of San Rafael. She is 23 years old and single. To make a living, Mildred owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mildred has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP when she sells one of the animals she has raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mildred joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Mildred is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Tres Pisos Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This communal bank is called \u201cLos Tres Pisos\u201d and it is composed of 15 members from the city of Temuco. The group members are seamstresses (making and selling things like curtains, tablecloths, and hats), artisans (creating products like jewelry and wooden accessories), clothing salespeople, grocers, and bakers of empanadas and cakes.\r\n\r\nThe group member interviewed was Ingrid, who is the bank\u2019s president. In the photo she is in the center of the back row wearing a red sleeveless vest over a black shirt. She sells a variety of products, things like hangers and card games, and changes her stock depending on what\u2019s in style, for example she may sell a game or a product specific to a particular holiday. Ingrid sells from a post located in the central zone of part of Temuco where she lives. Her post does not have a roof, so when it rains she does other sorts of work, like daycare or cooking. Ingrid plans on investing this loan in merchandise for her business: heating packs, hangers, and other novelty products she finds.\r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s dream is to have a place to sell which is protected from the rain, ideally in her home. Her greatest motivation are her children, 18 and 16, to whom she hopes to provide everything they need. Her oldest son is in his first year of the university.\r\n\r\nWhat Ingrid has enjoyed the most of Fondo Esperanza is the group work she does with her communal bank and the comfort she feels in the meetings because of the sincerity of all the members; this has allowed them to get to know one another very well and support each other.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live, some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":549293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

","en":"They are Shalom (which means peace and well-being), a group made up of 11 members, all of whom are persons with dreams and desires to improve and succeed. They all live in the Valle de Chalco area of Colonia San Miguel, Mexico. This group was formed thanks to a mutual acquaintance who told them about FRAC, which they then decided to inquire about. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe, a member of the group Shalom, is 40 years old. She just finished high school and is a single mother with two children, 20 years old and 2 years old. Guadalupe has sold school supplies in a stationery shop for the past 6 years as she desires a better future for her family. She likes sales; it helps her attend to people. For her, it is very rewarding to have her own business. Everyday she opens early and closes late. There are days when the sales are not good, but even then she tries to come out ahead. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy more articles, such as notebooks, coloring instruments, geometric games, erasers, pencil sharpeners and pencils, to have more merchandise at the stationery shop. Her plans are to finish fixing her house, giving her children an education and to have her own place so she no longer has to pay rent. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nAurora (Sale of shoes and bedspreads by catalog)                           \r\nJavier (Sale of construction materials)\r\nPatricia (Sale of bedspreads and comforters by catalog)                        \r\nSixto (Sale

Maria learned about the work that Fundacion Realidad does, and after talking with her neighbours they decided to form a group in order to be able to request a loan that will benefit their businesses. The members are housewives who like to have their own income and help with family expenses: Yolanda R. (children's clothing and costume jewellery sales), Mar\u00eda Elena Sol\u00eds (toy and gift bag sales), Diana Karina Rodr\u00edguez (footwear sales through a catalogue) and Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas D. Sol\u00eds (cosmetics sales through a catalogue).\r\nMar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas is the group's representative; her family is made up of her child who is in first grade, and her husband Juan who is a driver.\r\nShe has sold cosmetics through a catalogue for two years, when thanks in part to the motivation of her sister in law she decided to learn a business. Now she is satisfied with her sales, and catalogues are changed every two months. She tries to take advantage of this, most of her clients are women. She plans to save part of her earnings to buy a plot of land and build her home. Maria plans to use the loan to invest in her products.\r\nEach member has different hopes, but they each want to get ahead and plan to invest the loan in the purchase of products that they need, such as: gift bags, toys, catalogues, clothing, footwear, and costume jewellery. They are grateful for the help they receive from Kiva.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":545013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of gift bags, costume jewellery, toys, footwear and cosmetics catalogues, children's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Chalco, Estado de  M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-06T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1961.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2322.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2376.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2431.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2487.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2604.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.28},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.76},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":331.09,"local_amount":4264.94,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4287.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899577,"comment":null},{"amount":374.54,"local_amount":4824.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4850.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639922,"comment":null},{"amount":390.95,"local_amount":5035.93,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5062.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854204,"comment":null},{"amount":378.42,"local_amount":4874.57,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4900.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121104,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T07:21:46Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205402,"name":"Nkongoro Goat Rearing Group, Ntungamo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hardworking S.

Lupita not only sells near her house but is often called out for others to see her products. For her, business is good during holidays and slower during vacation season. It is very easy for her to work with people because she is not a shy individual and on the contrary, always has a smile. Lupita has plans for her children to have careers, to be able to have a pink car, and to become the director of Mary Kay.

They all live together in the community of Sirenachayocc, located in the beautiful rainforest of Cusco, where they have their own house.  Fortunata is aware of the limitations she has, since she only completed part of her secondary education, but this does not stop her from pursuing her dream of \"having her own income through her own business.\"  Accordingly, she took advantage of the knowledge and experience of her family and friends regarding the cultivation, preservation and harvesting of coffee.  Now she is working and attending educational lectures provided by her municipality regarding agricultural activities, with the objective of improving her production.  Currently she has 2 products: coffee and cocoa, which give her personal and economic satisfaction.  She is grateful to her partner for the help he has given her during the sowing season.  Only in the harvest season does she need to hire workers, to extract the coffee and transport it to the collection centers in her community, where she sells it for a good price.  Fortunata hopes in the very near future to have a grocery store, which would provide a new source of income that would allow her to improve the quality of life of her family.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her payments on time.  In addition, she is satisfied with her communal bank for the transparency and timeliness exercised by each of its members.    With the loan that she requests she will buy organic fertilizer to apply to her cultivations of cocoa and coffee, with the objective of improving her production and ensuring a good sale.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":549346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer to apply to her cultivations of coffee and cocoa.

En ocasiones vende accesorios telef\u00f3nicos. \n\nPara poder readecuar su negocio necesita tener mas ingresos por eso con el pr\u00e9stamo quiere comprar tarjetas de recargas para celulares. En el futuro quiere tener uno de los centro de llamadas mas grande de su sector. \n","en":"Oscar, 24, lives in a suburban area of Guayaquil.  He started selling \"Porta\" mobile phone recharges (Equador Telephone Company).  Little by little, with effort and dedication, his mobile recharge business grew.  To provide greater service, he purchased a phone booth in order to provide service to everybody.  \r\nCurrently he generates a good profit, working from 7:30am to 8:30pm every day.  He occasionally also sells phone accessories.  In order for his business to adapt, he needs to increase his income.  Therefore, with this loan, he wants to buy recharge cards for cellular phones.  In the future he hopes to have one of the biggest call centers in his area.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva

They live in the community of Sirenachayocc, which is located in the beautiful forests of Cusco where they have their own house. Claudia knows very well that carrying out any activity depends on the work you do and the efforts you put in. That is why she puts all her time into agriculture, specifically the cultivation and commercialization of cacao and the coca leaf, thanks to the lessons her parents taught her. Her success is due to the quality of her product and the attention she gives to her clients. Generally, her products are sold in the market centers of her community, at competitive prices. This gives her much satisfaction for the work she has accomplished so far. Her priority is to expand her crops to other strategic areas to minimize cost and time. That way she will have good economic results. Generally, she receives help from her husband and together they make a good working team.

V. lives with her spouse and children in the city of Malambo, in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. She has seven children between the ages of 12 and 30 years old.  She prepares fried dishes and also sells various merchandise.  Yadira started preparing business lunches 10 years ago in Santa Marta, the capital of the Department of Magdalena.  When her husband was transferred to the city of Barranquila, she decided to go with him and continued her business because she has always had the support of her husband her children.  For this reason, she was able to start in a new location, where she remained for two years until she received a housing subsidy in Malambo, where she still has her home and continues her frying business.  As she is an enterprising woman and she started to meet many people, she started to sell bags, shoes, and household items.  She also purchased a sewing machine to open a clothing store.\r\n\r\nYadira has always worked independently which has allowed her to manage her time and to care for her children.  With her daughter of 21 years, she also learned to create crafts with foam, with which she has made decorative figurines and obtains additional income when she decorates items for parties or creates home furnishing and sells crafts by the dozen.\r\n\r\nShe learned of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and saw an opportunity to improve her business.

C. is the representative of the group; she is 54 years old with six married children.  Teresa only finished the first graD. of primary school, and since that time, she has had to work. Unfortunately, she was widowed eight months ago.  She sells snack foods such as tacos, quesadillas, and gorditas; she also sells candies and potatoes, and she rents out homes.  She began her business roughly two years ago; as she saw the need to increase her income, she goes out daily to sell her products and when she can, she goes to events such as dances.  Teresa tries to sell as much as she can, and with this source of income she goes about supporting herself now that she has no family to support her. She always tries to have the ingredients ready for the preparation of her food in time to sell her products at night.  Even if she is busy running to keep up with her sales, she will always try to come out ahead. Her plans are to put in another food stall and to do some home improvement projects.  She has decided to take out this loan to invest in her snack stall business, and the other part in fixing up her house.\r\n\r\nThe other nine founding members of the group are: \r\nEsteL. D\u00edaz N. (sale of artistic photographs), Ricardo Ram\u00edrez G\u00f3mez (clothing store), Viridiana C. D\u00edaz (sale of tostados), Ofelia B. B. (sale of pi\u00f1atas). Efr\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez V. (sale of sweets), MariseL. F. Hern\u00e1ndez (bakery), Nancy S. M. (woodworking), Laura N. Guzm\u00e1n (sale of sweets), Yolanda F. Hern\u00e1ndez (sale of snack foods), Rene E. E. (sale of sweets) and Roberto C. M. (sale of artistic photographs). \r\n\r\nThey would like a loan to be able to buy necessary items to increase their stocks if items such as candy, photos, raw materials for food, flour, gelatin, and disposable items.  Increasing their stocks will allow them to have more customers.\r\n\r\nThe group feels fortunate to be able to work with support from Kiva through Fundacion Realidad.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mairead Harris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":546424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of sweets, artistic photographs, wood, tostadas, oil, gelatin moulds, puddings, and milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Valle De Chalco Solidaridad  Estado De Mexico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-14T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viridiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efren ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1052.48,"local_amount":13493.39,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":13629.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899580,"comment":null},{"amount":531.89,"local_amount":6819.11,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6887.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639925,"comment":null},{"amount":365.63,"local_amount":4687.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4734.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T07:03:01Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205431,"name":"Henry","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Henry C.

They are located in Colonia Plutarco El\u00edas Calles in Ixtapaluca, state of Mexico. The group is comprised of five members who know each other from not only being neighbors but because they also have a friendship. The Volcanes came together thanks to hearing reports from a neighbor about the work that the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad does, and they decided to begin with their meetings.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is Mar\u00eda Guadalupe C. H.. She is 45 years old. She studied up to secondary school and has 2 children, one girl who is already married and one boy who still lives with her. Mar\u00eda has sold catalog-order shoes and denim pants to made order for the last five years, but a year and a half ago she stopped her sales because she was facing a very difficult economic crisis. Mar\u00eda managed to get ahead thanks to her own efforts, and she retained some of the people she used to have as clients. She went out to present her catalogs every three days and when people would call her to bring them. She plans to have a larger business so she can help meet her household expenses. The reason she is requesting this loan is to buy new catalogs and to supply as many orders for shoes that she has for pants. People hear about her business through the recommendations of others. Mar\u00eda wants her business to grow and to have greater earnings, with which she could help her elderly mother who needs care and medications.\r\n\r\nThe other four members are: Rosa Isela Hern\u00e1ndez Z.

They live in their own wooden house located in the tropical rainforest in the community of Sirenachayocc in the Cusco area. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 20, Edilberta was already a skilled farmer and knew how to care for her cocoa plantations. Nevertheless, there were difficult times for her and her family as there were no buyers in her community because of the constant landslides in the area. As a result she lost her investment.\r\n\r\nThe following two years were spent paying back the money she owed to suppliers and workers. Over time she got her life back on track and returned to farming, but this time she planted coffee. From this moment on, her sales increased, more than in other years, and she already has future orders from her customers. As a result much is demanded of her if she is to fill the orders efficiently.\r\n\r\nGenerally she and her husband do the work, but at harvest time she needs extra hands to speed things up. Normally her products are sold to warehouses in her community.

Using a part of this money, she invested in her business. But things didn't go well for her, and separating from her husband after having 3 children, she came to Barranquilla in 2006.  By 2008, having saved $1,300,000 Colombian pesos as capital, and with the help of Social Action, who provided seed capital of $1,400,00 pesos, she launched anew her little store in Barrio Concord, Municipality of Malambo. In 2009, she moved it to Barrio Las Moras, where things have gone very well for her store, the \u201cTienda la Luna\u201d.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to add a new show-case to her store, in order to begin selling miscellany. Also, she wishes to purchase cases of drinks, which are very profitable, especially on weekends and market days. She has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation requesting a loan, since she already had  repaid this organization in a timely manner for 2 loans which were used for kitchen utensils (previously, she had made do with only the strictly necessary).\r\n\r\nMaria has 3 children, ages 12, 18, and 21, and lives in a rented house. But she dreams of having her own little house in the barrio where she has her market. She wishes to combine it with her miscellany store. \r\n\r\nLately she faces a great challenge which is not to sell at credit to everyone who requests it, but, rather, to select the customers she will finance very carefully, taking into account their capacity to pay. This will diminish the risk of losing what little money she has acquired through so much effort. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

They live in a wooden house located in the beautiful jungle of Cusco, specifically in the community of Sirenachayocc.  From a young age, Karina was taught the value of work and always wanted to help her parents with the farming duties or any other task that she was assigned.  She grew cacao and coffee to sell to retailers, but the prices they offered were too low, so she decided to start a business selling these products.  Karina opened her own store so that she could become independent and apply the lessons her parents taught her.  She has been working in her store for four years and now looks after her son at the same time.  Karina plans to continue her efforts so that she can provide for all their basic needs.  She is satisfied with what she has accomplished and part of her success is attributed to the way she treats her customers with great kindness and attention.  Karina usually works alone, but she occasionally receives help from her husband.  Every two weeks, she buys everything she needs to restock her business in order to maintain her customer base.  Her plans for the future include expanding her business by introducing new cutting-edge products in hopes of meeting the needs of her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

She is married and has 3 school-age children.  They live together in the Sirenachayocc community, in the beautiful Cuzque\u00f1a jungle.  They own their own home, which is made of wood.  Marisa thinks strategically:  her primary goal was to produce a high-quality product because potential buyers would pay more for high-quality and of course she would be able to sell her products quickly.  Secondly, she wanted to be in a competitive market, and, achieving this, she is now with other potential sellers.  In the future, she wishes to greatly expand her cultivated land in order to produce on a large scale.  She recognizes that she must work hard in her cocoa plantation.  Only at harvest will she need workers to transfer her product to markets in the community in order to sell it.  She currently has no difficulties in her business because everything is progressing smoothly and she already has 12 years experience working independently and successfully.  This is her second loan from MFP, and she is committed to making timely payments.  In addition, she assures us that she is comfortable with her communal bank.

They live together in the beautiful Peruvian tropical rainforest, located in the community of Sirenachayocc, where they have their own house, which is made of wood.  Growing up, the main source of income for her family was farming, but due to constant road closures they could not sell any of their products. So, unfortunately, they lost what they had invested. Maximiliana was 9 years old then, but enduring the problems and economic crises that she faced alongside her family shaped her into a woman of character.  Now she produces cocoa and sells it at the collection and distribution centers in her community. In addition, Maximiliana has a great deal of experience in the proper management of farm products. She is passing on her knowledge to her children with the assurance that they will later assume their parents\u2019 legacy in the proper way. She knows that the sales of her product provide her with good income which is why she hopes to expand her cocoa plantations in the future, and build a more substantial house in order to improve the quality of life for her family. This is her second loan with MFP, which is why she is committed to continue meeting her respective payments. In addition, she feels good about being a member of her communal group.  With the loan she is requesting, she will invest in proper maintenance of her cocoa plantations, and purchase supplies and fertilizer, in order to improve the quality and quantity of this product. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":549465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"The purchase of supplies and fertilizer for her cocoa plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":147.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":162.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":169.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":173.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.66,"local_amount":124.75,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934594,"comment":null},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":134.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673365,"comment":null},{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":136,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":136.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887189,"comment":null},{"amount":49.34,"local_amount":140.97,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154201,"comment":null},{"amount":51.54,"local_amount":147.27,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":147.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449510,"comment":null},{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":152.47,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":153.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588190,"comment":null},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":158.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":159.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724737,"comment":null},{"amount":57,"local_amount":162.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":163.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462949,"comment":null},{"amount":59.22,"local_amount":169.19,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":169.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886462,"comment":null},{"amount":60.72,"local_amount":173.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":174.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326767,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T16:37:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":205468,"name":"Gawlo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Gawlo D. est une femme de 70 ans, elle est veuve et m\u00e8re de 10 enfants dont les 6 sont toujours sous sa charge et 4 qui fr\u00e9quentent l\u2019\u00e9cole.

Combined with the service she offers and the quality of her products, this gives her an advantage by increasing her earnings. Her priority is the love she has for her daughters. That is why, with her spouse' help, they share the work. He works in agriculture and she works in her store. This way, they can offer their daughters whatever they need. Her daily routine is from 5:30 in the morning until 10:00 at night. Her store is located at her house in her own community. In the future, she hopes to expand her store to attract more customers.  This is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to keep making the payments on the established dates. She is also grateful to her community group for the responsiblility that each member has.  She plans on investing the loan in buying a considerable amount of merchandise so she can supply her business and satisfy her potential customer's needs.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":549476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a variety of merchandise to supply her business.

The artisans of Sinincay specialize in the production of marble and the manufacture of tiles and bricks. Some of the women make hats from toquilla fiber.

The four oldest have jobs and help their mother financially; the four youngest attend high school or primary school. Rosario tells us that she is also responsible for her three nephews and nieces as her sister has gone overseas to bring them a better standard of living. With her and her husband\u2019s hard work, they managed to build their own home.\n\nAs well as all her household chores, Sra.

She mentions that previous loans invested in her business have given 1 of her 6 children the opportunity to study in the university at present, and she plans to continue working assiduously as she has been doing for years, to give this same opportunity to the 3 youngest children, since, unfortunately, the 2 oldest never had the chance to study.  She always looks for ways to diversify her products in accord with her customers' demands.\r\n\r\nRosa Maria is requesting the loan to purchase sewing materials, cloth, and hats.  Her companions comment that she has gotten ahead thanks to her business and her dedication.  Her principal objective in life is to provide a heritage to her children, which is an education that will offer them a better life. This is the admirable thing about the women who make up these different groups, that despite the difficulties they face, always, their primary goal is the education of their children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nCarmela L.

She is 52 years old. Melania is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMelania is married. To make a living, Melania owns and operates a sari-sari store (general store). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Melania has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities. In 2007, Melania joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melania has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Melania is requesting a new loan of 43,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Melania from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.Given that
