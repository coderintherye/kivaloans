They are in a variety of activities like commerce, services and food sales, among other activities.\r\n\r\nWe met Eloisa, 25, here.  She\u2019s separated and has no children.  She lives in her parents\u2019 house. To cover her expenses, she\u2019s a merchant.  She sells all types of clothes and underwear door to door.  She sells for cash and also on credit to her most trustworthy customers.  She collects payments from them every 15 days.  She buys her merchandise in Guayaquil and has been in business three years.  She sells with her father who has been in the business about 20 years and who encouraged her to go into the world of commerce.\r\n\r\nThis loan was to buy pants, blouses, shirts and underwear.  It\u2019s her first cycle in the communal bank and she likes it because of the help she\u2019s going to get.  Her dream is to have a large store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":912366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-11-08T21:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Jazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilma Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cruz Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deisy Silvana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eloisa Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gissella Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jennifer Marbel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson Sebastian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3630,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":453.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":456.25,"local_amount":453.75,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":456.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563629,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":907.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774603,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":907.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":912.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182979,"comment":null},{"amount":1368.75,"local_amount":1361.25,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318286,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T21:04:31Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355160,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carolina tiene 24 a\u00f1os y vive con su familia, en una comunidad del distrito de Hatillo que es eminentemente urbano y residencial, sin embargo es objeto de una creciente actividad comercial, concentrada principalmente en los centros comerciales.

He is married to Rosanna, a housewife and mother to their three children. Rodel, together with his wife and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighbourhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. Rodel makes profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbours and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a 29,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nRodel hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to send all his children to college to have a good future.

At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAinnie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP)-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this she also earns additional income from a room that she offers for rent in her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business she is requesting a loan for 16,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAinnie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":912674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for groceries, toiletries, and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T05:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainnie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":7467,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7530.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529485,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4302.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738701,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4267,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4303.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145933,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-14T18:05:13Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355379,"name":"Ludivina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ludivina is 58 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan for 50,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

is Evelyn, 58, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Oscar, a side car driver, and a mother of seven children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating a business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP)-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Celia earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan for 50,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEvelyn dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":832.29,"image":{"id":918199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T10:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8426.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529488,"comment":null},{"amount":244.79,"local_amount":10416.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10533.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738704,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":8333.03,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8426.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145936,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8427.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274952,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-29T02:27:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355387,"name":"Stanley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stanley has been in the clothing business in the town of Naivasha for the last year.

one of the produce markets in Ivano-Frankivsk.  He previously worked at a brick factory, but was forced to find work at the market after the factory closed down.  Currently, Ivan sells vegetables, such as potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and also seasonal and nonseasonal fruits, citrus fruits, and also fish in the winter.  He always offers a wide variety of fruits and vegetables at low prices, and besides, there are not many competitors with similar products at the market.  Ivan has been involved in selling products for four years.  His monthly income is 7,000 hryvnia.  Previously, this market, where Ivan works, was disastrous.  Recently, however, local government decided to legalize and beautify this market and subsequently started to build neat kiosks-booths, each one of which costing 25,000 hryvnia.  Ivan wants to invest the money, received from Kiva, into the purchase of a new retail kiosk.  He needs to pay his first installment for the kiosk soon.  Ivan plans to work in the new kiosk, and his wife would work in the old kiosk, which will be relocated elsewhere.  As a result of this expansion, Ivan hopes that his sales will increase by 1.5-2 times.  In the future, Ivan wants to purchase a car, which is becoming more and more necessary for running the business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":312.38,"image":{"id":912731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a new kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Ivano-Frankivsk","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.884167 24.686111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T00:50:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":839}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":834.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811117,"comment":null},{"amount":104.12,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":834.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219841,"comment":null},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":834.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T15:48:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355410,"name":"Loise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loise is 54 years old, married and they are blessed with three children.\r\n\r\nShe is a greengrocer in the area of Kakuyuni where there is a good flow of customers.

She sells women's clothing at the local central market. Olga has a wide assortment of clothing which she sells at accessible prices. She has worked as a retailer at the market for 13 years. Today, her working capital is 30,000 UAH and her profit is 8,000 UAH. Olga plans to use a Kiva loan in the amount of 10,000 UAH to purchase women's clothing for fall and winter.

He is married and is the father of two grown and independent children, one of which already has his own family.  He has a 15 year old granddaughter who lives with him and depends on him to provide her an education and a good upbringing.  He owns his own house where he offered the best he had to his children and now he is giving everything for his granddaughter.  Francisco's work consists of transporting goods and passengers on his motorcycle taxi, a job that he has been doing for seven years.  When he first began, it was a lot of work for him, as he was not accustomed to doing that type of work.  As a result, he had many problems with his kidneys, but through time he found ways to be able to have better health and now he is an absolute expert.  What he likes about his work is that it allows him to manage his own schedule and to give himself the necessary rest when he needs it, as well as being able to have a way to get around for his family.  It is not going great, as business is a little slow, but he has an idea to put a grocery store in the front of his house and in that way have the ability to earn additional income.  This will be his seventh loan with MFP, and is very happy to know that he will have financial support since in that way he will feel more secure as he moves ahead with his work.  On the other hand he is committed to making his payments, as he has done with previous loans that he has had.

What he likes about his work is that it gives him time to do other things: he also works in a bank in the city, which gives him greater financial stability. Things are going very well because he has two incomes - and while he would like to continue this way, he has it in mind to build up his business. This will be his first loan from MFP. He is very happy to know he can access this financial support, because with it he feels he has more security in developing his business. With the sum he has requested, he will buy more drinks to continue increasing his sales and improving his earnings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.16,"image":{"id":913027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T19:21:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":160.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":171.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":178.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":181.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.29,"local_amount":150.1,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":152.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621970,"comment":null},{"amount":59.48,"local_amount":158.62,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":160.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836051,"comment":null},{"amount":60.02,"local_amount":160.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":162.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245811,"comment":null},{"amount":64.37,"local_amount":171.65,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":173.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385844,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-21T11:58:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355615,"name":"Maria De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en la aldea de Angel Fajardo en el municipio de Chamelecon.

She is a single mother to six children who are all now grown up and independent.  She owns her own house and lives there alone.  A long time ago, Juana decided to work hard so that she could educate and feed her children (who are now grown up and support her with some of her needs).  However, even so, she still works hard in order to support herself.\r\n\r\nJuana's work can be divided into three.  Firstly, she sells groceries.  She buys her products wholesale and then sells them retail.  In this business, she makes an average profit of 25% in accordance with what she invests.  Her second line of work is sewing.  She makes her own creations and also carries out work for some customers.  Finally, she raises pigs.  She has a lot of pigs and currently has one which is pregnant.  She has been in these businesses for several years.\r\n\r\nWhat Juana likes about her work is that it allows her the time she needs to carry out all three of her activities.  Her business is going well as she always has orders for her pigs and she sells them at a good price.  She hopes to continue growing in her business and to have a larger space in which to raise her animals.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's ninth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can reach her goal of gradually continuing to grow in her business.  She is very happy to be working with her community bank as all the members are very responsible.  Juana will use the sum she has requested to buy merchandise for her grocery store.  She will also buy nutritionally-balanced feed for her animals and some vaccines and vitamins that she needs to give to her piglets which are about to be born."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":480.21,"image":{"id":913039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise with which to stock her store and to buy food and vaccines for her pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T19:21:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":317.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":320.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":343.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":356.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":363.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.55,"local_amount":300.13,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":304.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621971,"comment":null},{"amount":118.93,"local_amount":317.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":321.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836052,"comment":null},{"amount":120.02,"local_amount":320.03,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":324.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245812,"comment":null},{"amount":128.71,"local_amount":343.23,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":347.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-21T19:41:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":355627,"name":"Jose Nelson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, ha realizado su inversi\u00f3n con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior, tuvo muy buenos resultados, por eso est\u00e1 motivado para aumentar la mercader\u00eda, actualmente comprara concentrado para las gallinas, adem\u00e1s comprara abono para preparar la siembra de la temporada.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayudo para mantener el equilibrio necesario y atender a los clientes, con la venta de gallinas y de granos b\u00e1sicos.\n\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 made an investment with a previous loan and had very good results.
