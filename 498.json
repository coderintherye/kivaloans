For this reason, Bauzhar is applying for a loan of 100,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase more goods to resell at the local market.

They live in Keper-Arik village, in the northern part of Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating from college, she worked as a laboratory assistant at a local plant. When Suyumkan was 20, she got married and soon became the mother of her beloved children. Her husband worked at the sugar mill but his wage was too low to cover all their family\u2019s expenses. In order to support her family, Suyumkan decided to engage in livestock breeding. She bought one milk cow and one bull-calf and managed to develop a farm with four bull-calves and cows. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, using the revenues from selling most of the cattle, Suyumkan was able to buy a car and pay for her son\u2018s education. Now Suyumkan plans to use this loan of 60,000 Kyrgyz Soms to broaden her number of cattle for fattening and reselling.

Now he has customers not only in town but also in cities like Cartagena and Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHe used his first loan from this institution to increase his ability to supply his customers with the crafts they required and now he can offer better payment options.  Increased profits have helped him make home improvements and pay for his children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have his own store where he can sell everything related to his town\u2019s crafts.  This is why he makes the effort to increase his customer base daily and to have additional working capital through loans that will allow him to purchase assorted crafts to always have a wide selection of stock available.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is his second loan.  He will use it to buy hammocks, purses, backpacks, fabric for purses and zippers that will generate a 35% profit. The investment is guaranteed success because it will be applied during December, January and February which is when crafts sales spike because many tourists are on vacation and when they pass through this town they stop to buy in quantity either to resell or to keep as souvenirs or for their and their families\u2019 own use.\r\n

He lives at his parents' house, along with his daughter, Karol, of 2 years old.  Above all, he wishes to offer her a better future and for that he is willing to working very hard.  When he was a child, his parents taught him everything he needed to know about their small farm and little by little with the passing of time, he began to become in charge of his parents' land, since his older siblings decided to dedicate themselves to other professions.  Nowadays, he has an extensive amount of land to plant cacao and coco leaves.  After they are harvested, they are sold in the city of San Francisco.  What he enjoys most about his job is the cultivation because he knows that, luckily, with this activity he can support his family.  He has spent the past 15 years working in agriculture and the most challenging part of it has been protecting his plants from pesticides.  His objective is to purchase new land to increase his cultivations.  This is his first credit with MFP and plans to be very punctual with his payments.  In his communal bank, he is a very supportive member of the rest of his group.  With the 1,000 Soles that he is applying for, he will purchase cacao seeds and coco leaves, in addition to fertilizers in order to assure the results of his hard work.

M..  The group's name was chosen in honor of the street where the group's members live in the settlement of San Juan Jicayan which is located 45 minutes north of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.\r\nThe women's settlement is entirely maD. up of Mixtec indigenous people.  Most of the inhabitants work in crafts and in farming.  Amongst the hand-crafted items which they produce are 'j\u00edcaras' (traditional drinking bowls maD. from calabashes or gourds), textiles such as 'naguas' (skirts) and 'huipiles' (blouses or tunics).  These 'naguas' and 'huipiles' form part of their traditional dress.\r\n\r\nThe magic of this settlement lies in its traditions and customs but unfortunately its people have suffered great changes.  This is the case, for example, of the patenting of 'huipil' making.  They were displaced by foreign machines and have been robbed of the legacy of their symbology.  In this settlement, poverty prevails and they have been neglected by the authorities.  This means that its  inhabitants have emigrated to the United States and other places away from their communities.  Ignorance and a lack of education are ingredients which combine with the inequality which is found in the majority of the indigenous settlements in this region.  At the end of this story we will see the name of each one of the members of this group and the business activities which they pursue to make money.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, let us make a space so that we can talk a little about the life of one of the members of this group.  Mrs Julia Dionicio Hern\u00e1ndez is 32 years old.  She is married to 36 year-old F\u00e9lix who has spent all his life working in the fields.  Julia has been married for 15 years and has 5 children who are currently studying.  Her children are: 15 year-old Miguel who is in the third year of high school, 13 year-old Adelina who is in her first year of high school, 10 year-old Florentino, 8 year-old Juana and 7 year-old F\u00e9lix who are in their fifth, third and second years of elementary school.  They all speak Mixtec and their mother speaks only very little Spanish.\r\n\r\nSince she was 10 years old, Julia has been making traditional garments which are now known as  handicrafts such as: 'naguas' (traditional skirts), backstrap loom weavings, 'huipiles' (traditional blouses or tunics), napkins and also hand-maD. threads.  This has been part of a legacy which has been passed down from generation to generation and which also provides money to support the family.  As we have already mentioned, Julia has spent her whole life making handmaD. textiles called 'backstrap loom weaving' but what is backstrap loom weaving and what do you make with it?\r\n\r\nLet us talk a little more about backstrap loom weaving which is known as 'saahma tavi'.  This technique dates back to ancient times.  We can point out that it is from pre-hispanic times and has great value and its own style.  Rustic materials maD. from unique wood are used along with a unique finish.  Items of clothing are maD. such as 'naguas' (traditional skirts which are called 'chee' in Mixtec), 'huipiles' to cover the back and there are also backstrap loom weaving techniques for the making of 'huipiles' in the form of a dress which are called 'shicu lestu'.  In the making of these clothes, the dyes also have ancient origins since they are use dyes obtained from a sea shell known as 'caracol p\u00farpura' (literally, 'purple shell') from which colors such as 'guinda' (a cherry color), 'morado' (a mulberry color) and purple are obtained.  They also use indigo, cochineal and '\u00e1rbol D. caracol' (another kind of shell-based dye).  In fact, these clothes just can't be compared to clothes created on an industrial machine.\r\n\r\nJulia joined a loan group because she needed a loan to acquire the necessary material to make her crafts.  With this money she will be able to buy the following material: cotton threads for making 'huipiles', rustic threads for creating backstrap loom weavings, shell-dyed threads for making 'naguas', different colored threads for making napkins and tablecloths, embroidery threads and different colored worsted yarns and ribbons.\r\n\r\nOne of Julia's most longed-for dreams is to set up an organization of craftswomen where she can preserve and teach the valuable techniques of this art as well as promote these items of clothes which have been displaced by modernist fashion trends.  She would also like for women of few means to be able to learn this traD. so that they can improve their lives and those of their families, to show that indigenous women can shine and no longer need to be in a corner, abandoned and lagging behind.  She also wants to see her children be successful.  She wants them to have a better life, far from poverty and need, and for them not to have to emigrate.  She wants them to be good and hard-working people.\r\n\r\nAll the people who make up this group are hard-working women.  They are all indigenous women, full of vitality and an infinite hope, who believe in their dreams and believe in the goodness of other people.\r\n\r\nJulia is totally grateful for this noble gesture of help which the people who are supporting Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad are offering.  Those around the world who are putting in their grain of sand through Kiva to improve the lives of the most vulnerable.  In the name of her fellow group members, she sends you a big hug.\r\n\r\nBelow we give you the names of those who make up the \u201cAbasolo\u201d group and list their business activities:\r\nLucia D.

The group received its name from the fact that in the place where they meet there are many fruit trees, such as mango trees, banana trees, papaya trees, guan\u00e1bana trees and coconut trees.  They thought that in the same way as vines have their vineyards they do too, just vineyards of fruit trees.  Santa Mar\u00eda Huazolititlan is 30 minutes from Pinotepa on the lower part of the coast.  In this place Mixtec is spoken and most of the inhabitants make bread with egg yolks from hens from the ranch.  This makes their breads famous and much valued.  They also make handicrafts, embroidering ribbons and blankets.  These are then sold in the towns of Pinotepa, Jamiltepec and the capital of Oaxaca.  At the end of this story we will see the name of each one of the group members and the business activities which they pursue to make money.\n\nOn this special occasion we will speak a little about the life of one of the group's members, Mrs Ciria G\u00f3mez Hern\u00e1ndez.  She is 37 years old and married to Julian who is also 37 and a bricklayer.  Ciria has been married for 20 years and has 5 children: Georgina, 18; Mauricio, 17; Abigail, 14; Araceli, 12 and Richard who is 8.\n\nSince she was 13, Ciria has been making traditional clothes which are currently known as handicrafts such as hand-embroidered 'huipiles' (a traditional blouse or tunic), 'blusas de manta' (a traditional blouse), skirts and napkins.  This has been part of a legacy which has been handed down from generation to generation which also provides money to support the family.  As we already mentioned, Ciria has spent her whole life making hand-crafted embroideries which are from ancient times.  They are part of the daily clothingof the people who live in this area and they have great value and their own style.  Unique materials are used and a combination of colors which distinguish their own own community from others and which are different from other embroideries since each town has their own characteristics and colors which sets them apart.\n\nCiria joined a loan group because she needed a loan to use to acquire the necessary material to make her handicrafts.  With this money she will buy the following material: different colored cotton threads, a thread called 'hilo vela', silk thread, double satin and one-sided satin ribbons, traditional calico, backstrap loom, needles and embroidery hoops..\n\nAll the people who make up this group are hard-working women.  They are all indigenous women, full of vitality and an infinite hope, who believe in their dreams and believe in the goodness of other people.\n\nCiria is totally grateful for this noble gesture of help which the people who are supporting Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad are offering.  Those around the world who are putting in their grain of sand through Kiva to improve the lives of the most vulnerable.  In the name of her fellow group members, she sends you a big hug.\n\nBelow we give you the names of those who make up the \u201cLas Vi\u00f1as\u201d group and list their business activities:\nRosa M.

En la actualidad ella se dedica a vender mercanc\u00edas como: blusas, camisas, pantalones, faldas, jeans para hombres y mujeres, calzado, perfumes, aretes, pulseras y accesorios femeninos. El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace dos a\u00f1os cuando a ra\u00edz del incremento en los gastos familiares, debido especialmente a la educaci\u00f3n de los hijos, y a las dificultades del hogar para aumentar los ingresos, la microempresaria consigui\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o pr\u00e9stamo con un familiar, viaj\u00f3 a Cartagena, la m\u00e1s importante ciudad tur\u00edstica de Colombia y compr\u00f3 algunos pocos productos que llev\u00f3 a su pueblo natal.

The business started years ago when, due to an increase in family expenditures, mainly because of the children\u2019s education and other household difficulties.  This small business owner got a small loan from a family member, traveled to Cartagena, the most important tourist city in Colombia, and bought some products that she brought to her hometown.\r\n\r\nShe had total sales success.  She sold the merchandise to neighbors, friends, family and those that were referred to her.  She required a down payment and gave them up to 45 days to pay off the balance.  Clientele and orders began to increase.  With satisfaction, Betty says that today she helps her husband with family costs, without neglecting her duties as mother and wife because her business does not take up all of her time.  Her profit margin from this activity is 38%, on average.\r\n\r\nThis is Betty's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to be invested in the purchase of clothes for men, women, and children and for footwear, perfume and women\u2019s accessories.

She is an architecture student, which adds value to her business by using its natural aesthetics to attract customers who otherwise wouldn't notice it. Her mother and siblings have always supported her entrepreneurial ideas. A long time ago she started out selling meat, but since that business only operated during the morning she decided to start selling merchandise out of the side of her home. She took out her first loan with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo six years ago, and since then she has received a total of eight loan with which she has been able to stock her store with supplies. She has invested the profits into making improvements on her home. She bought household appliances to make her domestic life easier. Now her dreams are to expand her business and build an apartment on the side of her store and put it up for rent, and in this way generate a new source of income for her family. With her loan she plans to purchase clothing, stationery supplies and household items and investment that projects a gross profit of 40 percent with a high probability of success. In her experience, December, January and February are the months where she makes the most sales. Lorena is pleased that her business is located in a business corridor on the main avenue because she permanently has a view of many of her customers and passersby, which means she is always thinking of ways to invest new working capital and finding financial leverage with loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo

Desde entonces trabaja todos los d\u00edas arduamente, para luego llegado el momento adecuado, cosechar sus productos y venderlos en la ciudad de San Francisco. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene en el desempe\u00f1o de su labor, ya que ella decide que es lo mejor para sus cultivos, lleva 10 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos, ya que la mayor\u00eda de veces, le es muy dif\u00edcil conseguir movilidad para llevar su producci\u00f3n.

Since she got her inheritance, she has worked laboriously every day.  Then, at the right time, she harvests the produce and sells it in the city of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her employment is the freedom she has in performing her work, as it is she who decides what is best for her crops.  She has spent ten years in this occupation and considers the hardest part to be the transportation of produce, as most of the time it's very difficult for her to get a means to convey her harvest.  In future, she hopes to purchase new land in order to expand the sowing of her crops.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP; she knows she must be punctual with her payments, as she has been with her previous loans.

She has survived two tragedies in her life -- she lost both her husband and her son. However, Anastasia didn\u2019t give up on life and the opportunities it offers. She had a daughter to provide for. She started her own small business 8 years ago. Today she is still running it in one of the local marketplaces of her home town of Drogobych called \u2018Malyi\u2019 (\u2018Small\u2019).  Anastasia is selling women\u2019s lingerie. Presently, she has already invested 20,000 Grivnyas in her enterprise.  \r\n\r\nAnastasia is seeking a loan of 6,500 Grivnyas to purchase merchandise for her vending kiosk. Assorted selection of lingerie items will help her attract more potential buyers and thus stay competitive with other market vendors selling the same type of inventory. The profit generated will provide funds sufficient to meet Anastasia\u2019s basic needs.

She is 30 years old, is a businesswoman, and has two children: a boy and a girl. She sells coats and jackets, an activity she began 9 years ago with a small fruit cocktail stand outside of the community's school, asking the children for help when charging because she did not know how to add or subtract. Since her sales were good, she continued saving and bought clothes and because she is a good saleswoman, her neighbors had her bring them sheets and bedspreads, which she sold in batches or monthly payments. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband works in a factory and also helps her sell along with her coworkers. Ms. Araceli is very enthusiastic and never gives up although on occasion her sales have dropped very much. She always tells her husband \"a peso earned is worth more than one thousand robbed.\" She is seeking this loan to invest in jackets and coats which she sells a lot of in this season and grow her sales and her business so that in the future she can give her children a high quality education who she hopes to be good professionals and not be like her, who learned arithmetic with much difficulty.

She is a saleswoman and has 4 children: 2 girls and 2 boys.  Rocio sells handicrafts (embroidered napkins) and curtains for cars.  She started this business 6 years ago with only 3 meters of cloth and 10 rods.  She didn't know how to sew or embroider but she really needed to start a business which could support her family since her husband didn't have a job so she asked a neighbor to teach her to embroider and use a sewing machine.  She paid for these lessons by doing work in the neighbor's house such as washing her clothes and helping her with her housework.  She only received 45 minutes worth of instruction at a time though as her neighbor's husband got annoyed if he found her in his house.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the bad treatment which she received in learning her traD., after a couple of weeks she had learned all she needed to in order to set up her business and now she no longer has just 3 meters of fabric and 10 rods but rolls of fabric and more than 100 kg of rods.  She is requesting this loan to be able to buy more sewing machines and employ neighbors from her community so that they don't have to go to other states and can stay in their community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":643893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2361},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2422},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2484},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2548},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2613},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2680},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2749},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2820},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2892},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2966},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3042},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3120},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3283},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3367},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3453}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.15},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":259.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1908.58,"local_amount":23568,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":23588.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660109,"comment":null},{"amount":1264.15,"local_amount":15611,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":15624.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403378,"comment":null},{"amount":552.27,"local_amount":6821,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6827.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-05T01:35:35Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":249788,"name":"Rebeca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rebeca, de 32 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy sencilla y trabajadora, vive en su casa que es propia junto a su esposo Ra\u00fal de 36 a\u00f1os y sus 3 queridos hijos, a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida.

She is a merchant and has seven children, three girls and four boys. She sells clothing and also runs a stationery store. She started ten years ago with a small amount of clothing; her customers paid in installments. The business was funded through a neighbourhood savings bank. Sales were good, and Felipa invested part of her income in the business, and part for food. Thanks to her business skills and responsible attitude, she was able to expand the business, and her neighbours invited her to form part of their group.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Felipa to make progress as her husband was sick; however, she left her husband in the care of her children and went to work.

One of the difficulties she has in serving in her business is that she suffered a facial paralysis (as you can see in the photo).\r\n\r\nShe will use her loan to buy rice, drinks and canned food for her store.

In her beloved town of Santa Rosa, Victoria has spent most of her life learning how to farm, an activity which her family is engaged in.  Today she grows cacao, coffee and coca leaf which has provided her with the income she needs to support her family.  She sells her harvests in the town of San Francisco which is where she obtains the best prices for her products.\r\n\r\nWhat Victoria most likes about her work is sowing her fields and she does this with great care.  She has been in this business for 30 years and considers that the most difficult thing about it is transporting her products since transport is very scarce in her area.  Over time, she would like to buy new land in order to increase her production.\r\n\r\nThis is Victoria's second loan with MFP.  She has been very punctual in making her repayments up to now and hopes to continue being so.  She is a very active member of her community bank and is very well liked by the rest of the members.  She will use the 2,000 nuevos soles she is requesting to buy more fertilizer for her land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":643958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T16:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":168.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":181.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":189.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":196.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":203.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":217.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":225.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":231.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":171.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588884,"comment":null},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725384,"comment":null},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":181.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":184.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463481,"comment":null},{"amount":68.74,"local_amount":189.62,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":193.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886864,"comment":null},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":196.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":199.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327217,"comment":null},{"amount":73.68,"local_amount":203.24,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":206.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195770,"comment":null},{"amount":76.27,"local_amount":210.42,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":214.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269467,"comment":null},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":217.03,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":220.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549521,"comment":null},{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":225.51,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":229.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718259,"comment":null},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":231.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":235.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T19:31:21Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":249823,"name":"Miriam Janneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Miriam M. es socia del banco comunal Dinast\u00eda Espoir, vive en la ciudadela  los Eucaliptos en la ciudad de Cuenca, esta ciudad es conocida por la belleza de su centro hist\u00f3rico, tiene una gran variedad en su gastronom\u00eda, es muy rica en su cultura y tradiciones y su gente es amable y cordial.\n\nNuestra socia tiene 29 a\u00f1os, es casada y tiene dos hijos de 12 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad, su primer hijo estudia en el colegio y su segunda hija en la escuela.

Her parents were previously in charge of this business, which has been a great benefit to her, and so she taught this trade to her daughter.  Ada has 2 dependent children.  She sells most of her products on a cash basis, and most of her customers come to her business because she offers her products at a favorable price.

She is a single mother and lives in a rental house with her son.  Every day, very early in the morning, after one hour in the car, she arrives at the caf\u00e9 at the Instituto de Engergia Nuclear (Institute for Nuclear Energy) where she works selling coffee, sandwiches, cakes, cookies and soda.  Her customers like her friendly service and so her caf\u00e9 is always full.  She feels very happy with her business because of the money it makes which allows her to pay an assistant.  Her assistant is very helpful in the business.  What she most likes about the work is that she gets to interact with a lot of people.  She chats a lot to her customers and is kept very busy.  In the future, she would like to buy a display case where she can display her desserts.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilda's 11th loan from MFP and she knows that she has to make her repayments punctually.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a general store, a motor shop and a vulcanizing business. Her husband Rolly, who is 40 years old, works as a motor mechanic to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 6 and 14 years old.\r\n\r\nErlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $370, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, with which she intends to buy equipment for the motor shop and stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her businesses. Erlyn Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Delicioso, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a piggery and a clothing sales business. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Rolando, who is 48 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  \r\n\r\nThey have four children who are between 13 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nLydia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lydia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use to buy pig feed and clothes to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for home repairs. Lydia V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

R., a married woman who lives in Sitio Enclaro, Brgy. Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental, earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a buying and selling (nipa) and a fish-vending business. Her husband Josie, 36, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 1 and 13 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLerma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to use as additional capital for her nipa  and fish businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lerma R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Santol, Brgy. Tugawe, Dauin, Negros Oriental, earns her living by operating two ventures:  computer games and general store businesses. Her 44-year-old husband, Benjamin A., works as a security guard to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 5 and 11 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nPerla Joy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Perla Joy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 in order to buy stocks for the general store and new gaming machines so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Perla Joy A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p> \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Magdalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired after something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Magdalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use for maintenance of an additional home to rent so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Magdalena A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

T. is a married woman who lives in Gilside, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a vegetable-selling business, a rice-selling business, and a general store. Her husband, Erwin T., who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nElma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 18 prior loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan in the amount of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, thereby improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is seeking to borrow a loan in the amount of 18,000 PHP ($425), which she intends to use to buy vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and her children's education. Elma T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon -- a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Madeline has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Madeline joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) to gain much-needed access to financial services. In turn, she was better able to engage in business activities and to help improve her family's standard of living. Madeline recently and successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC in the amount of 3,000 PHP. This previous loan was used to expand her product lines. Madeline is now requesting a new loan, again in the amount of 3,000 PHP ($75), which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. Notably, this loan would be the third loan taken out by Madeline from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to financially support immediate members of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

A. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Cambaog, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business buying and selling rice.  Her husband, Rodolfo A., is 45 years old and works as a driver to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 16 and 25 years old. \r\n\r\nHelen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for a new business. She plans to save up for future improvement and expansion of the business. \r\n\r\nHelen A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is from the village of Bonbon, Catarman, Camiguin Province. She is 33 years old. Janeth is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Janeth owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, detergents, junk foods, biscuits and beverages in the local community. Janeth has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Janeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Janeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":644179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

S. is a married woman who lives in Purok 1A, Brgy. 9, Daan Banwa, Victorias City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: cosmetics sales, fish vending and buying and selling livestock. Her husband Daniel S. Jr. is 53 years old and works as a fish vendor to earn his living.  He also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have four children between the ages of 8 and 19.  \r\n\r\nWilme joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilme has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to purchase cosmetic products and fish to sell so that she could continue to save up for her children's future education. \r\n\r\nWilme S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking on the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

M. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Baod, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and buying and selling of firewood. Her husband, Librado M., who is 45 years old, works as a carpenter (foreman) to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 13 children who are between 2 and 23 years old. Two of her children are married, three are working and four are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nNarcisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Narcisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Narcisa M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\t\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

P. is a married woman who lives in Zone 1, Nabulao, Sipalay City, Neg.

Her husband Arturo P., who is 41 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 1 child who is 9 years old.\r\n\r\nShirley joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Shirley has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to use as funds for business operations so that she can continue to save up for future education expenses for her child. Shirley P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP26,500, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Candelaria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

G. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Tagbak, Brgy. Hilub-ang, Calatrava, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and farming. Her husband, Francisco G., who is 55 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have ten children who are between 8 and 30 years old.\r\n\r\nBienvinida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bienvinida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy feed and fertilizers for the farm so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of business. Bienvinida G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Lantap, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 44 years old. Victoria is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVictoria is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Victoria owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Victoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victoria is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Victoria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
