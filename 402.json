The women live in the town of Cuenca but are natives of Quingeo parish located to the south-east of the canton of Cuenca. To the north is the parish of Santa Ana, to the south the parish of San Jos\u00e9 de Raranga of S\u00edgsig canton, and to the west the parishes of Cumbe and Tarqui. Most of the inhabitants work in agriculture and cattle raising, but as well they grow corn, potatoes, beans and barley. Growing flowers is a new and lucrative venture. Cattle raising is important in the lower areas especially for the production of milk. As soon as boys reach working age, they move to Cuenca to take up jobs as construction workers, or as factory workers, artisans of different types, or in various business or transportation ventures. A good number of the women have jobs as domestic servants.\r\n\r\nRosa B. lives on the outskirts of Cuenca but is a native of Quingeo parish. She moved to the city in search of better work opportunities and to help her family get ahead. She is 22 years old, single, and lives with her parents. She contributes very little to household expenses as they have to pay rent, but back in their community they own their own house. Rosa has been selling vegetables for three years in the Feria Libre market. She works on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 5am to 6pm. The other days she cleans houses from 7am to 5pm. This is Rosa\u2019s second loan cycle and she wishes to use the money to buy tomatoes, onions, peppers, carrots, chard, and other vegetables for her business. Her goal is to expand into other products and thus improve service to her customers.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Lilia Jim\u00e9nez is an entreprising member of the group who is always seeking a better life. She sells earrings, hair accessories, head bands etc., work she\u2019s been doing for nine years. She has her own stall in the 10 de Agosto market where her children also help to sell the merchandise. She works from 8am to 2pm, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nLilia is 39 years old and lives with her partner. They have three children aged 19, 11, and 7. Her oldest son helps with the business, and the two younger children attend school in the town. Her husband is a taxi driver. As they do not own a house, they live in rented accommodation. This is Lilia\u2019s first loan. She was invited to join this team of hardworking women by a friend. With the money she will buy earrings, hair accessories, buttons, etc to better stock her business. Her goal is to buy a vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":541559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy vegetables and hair accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Olga Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosario Del Cisne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Eudalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":183.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":549.99,"local_amount":549.99,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":549.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892479,"comment":null},{"amount":366.66,"local_amount":366.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":366.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632825,"comment":null},{"amount":549.99,"local_amount":549.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":549.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846859,"comment":null},{"amount":366.66,"local_amount":366.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":366.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113338,"comment":null},{"amount":366.7,"local_amount":366.7,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":366.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406905,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T05:51:04Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201538,"name":"Brenda Janeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      La se\u00f1ora Brenda Janeth V. est\u00e1 muy agradecida por su cooperaci\u00f3n en el anterior cr\u00e9dito con el cual pudo dar la diferencia que le faltaba para que le entregaran su vivienda, don est\u00e1n viviendo ella y sus hijos.\nSolicita nuevamente un pr\u00e9stamo para poder construir un cuarto de madera ya que la casa es peque\u00f1a y no hay suficiente espacio para los ni\u00f1os.

Ella es una muy emprendedora, que no conoce obst\u00e1culos pues asegura que con voluntad lo puede conseguir todo. Hace mas de 8 a\u00f1os trabaja como docente de nivel inicial pero tambi\u00e9n se dedica al bordado y tejido con bastidor (madera larga de metro y medio que estira la tela), adem\u00e1s de la costura de prendas de vestir.

Sin embargo el tener que poner toda su atenci\u00f3n hace que se esfuerce la vista y con el paso del tiempo se esta perjudicando. Pero para ella todo esfuerzo es recompensado, ya que cada metro de tela que es bordada, cobra la suma de S\/. 350.00 nuevos soles, esta ganancia econ\u00f3mica le permite ahorrar para desarrollar sus planes futuros, pues Teresa desea instalar una tienda de comestibles grande dentro de su vivienda. Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP y como ya conoce la metodolog\u00eda de trabajo de su grupo  comunal se siente m\u00e1s tranquilo y seguro, el saber que pertenecer a un grupo muy bien conformado donde prima el respeto y la responsabilidad.

She is a single mother, with a 3-year-old son named Cheng Yostin. She and her child live together in her own house. Teresa is a very enterprising woman who does not recognize obstacles, because she is confident that if she has the will, she can achieve anything. More than 8 years ago, she began working as a kindergarten teacher, but she also worked in embroidery and weaving on a bastidor (a wooden frame 1.5 meters long which stretches the fabric), as well as sewing clothing. In general, she receives the highest volume of orders for her work during holiday seasons. She does all the work alone, without help from anyone. She very much enjoys choosing the color combinations for the embroidery threads, making sure that they are striking and attractive. However, having to concentrate on this work has required to strain her eyes and has affected her vision over time. Still, she finds that all of her effort brings rewards, since for every meter of fabric she embroiders, she receives 350 Peruvian new soles.

For this reason, she decided to look for a way to earn money, and started her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen, who has a restaurant in the community of Los Ideales, formed the group. Yanet and the other nine members joined her in forming the group, which is now beginning its first loan cycle. The group is named Los Ideales which, aside from being the name of the community, signifies for them, goals, objectives, and following dreams that one day, thanks to the efforts of each member and the help of loan institutions, will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nYanet needed this loan to invest in a business that she has run for a few months with her brother. She does not have an established location, but works from her home. She will invest the loan in the purchase of 100 young chicks, as she now has 50 that are ready for sale. She will also buy feed for the chicks and have a little left over to continue growing. \r\n\r\nAside from the raising and selling of chicks, Yanet has two other business activities, which demonstrates her entrepreneurial spirit. She makes earrings, bracelets, and necklaces from stones and colored beans. She sells these from house to house among her friends and acquaintances in the community. She stocks up on materials for the jewelry each month in the state of Oaxaca, and she re-invests her earnings back into one of her businesses.\r\n\r\nYanet also has a small grocery store located 15 minutes from her home in the community of Piedra de Amolar. Although this business is small, she tries to keep it stocked, as it is one of the few stores available for the residents of this town.\r\n\r\nYanet would like to have her own house in which to raise her daughter and give her a place to study, something she considers essential. She also wants to continue maintaining and enlarging her small businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Los Ideales group is made up of seven women and three men. Mar\u00eda del Carmen will invest in new furniture for her restaurant. Kicsia Irais will use her loan money to buy ingredients for the making of snacks. Jazm\u00edn will buy shoes to sell. Cecilia will buy young pigs to raise and resell to butcher shops. Otilio will buy young chicks to raise and resell. Reyna will buy cloth for her tailoring business. Nallely will use the loan to stock her general store. Mois\u00e9s will buy cloth, and thread for making aprons. Rogelio will stock his general store with rice, beans, sugar, cookies, and cleaning products.\r\n\r\nAll the members are grateful to know that organizations like Fundacion Realidad are there to help them grow and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":541463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Jewelry making supplies and stock for general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN LUCAS OJITLAN","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayelli Sugey ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kicsia Irais ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1312.5,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":16603.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715842,"comment":null},{"amount":875,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11069.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899565,"comment":null},{"amount":875,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":11069.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639910,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5534.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854192,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T21:57:37Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201557,"name":"Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andr\u00e9s es un hombre risue\u00f1o y bastante empe\u00f1oso en sus labores, tiene 56 a\u00f1os, casado con Alejandrina de 46 a\u00f1os, con quien tiene 5 hijos pero s\u00f3lo vive con tres, en su casa propia.

The usual routes that he covers are located in the center of town and the outskirts of the city.  \r\n\r\nAgust\u00edn has two mototaxis to do this work, but currently has only one functioning.  The other is inoperable due to problems with the motor.  He would like to repair it in order to rent it to someone and be able to earn more money that would permit him to help his family.  To achieve his objective, he has solicited a loan of 500 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa for the first time.\r\n\r\nAgust\u00edn is a hard-working and industrious man.  His dream is to start his own transportation business in order to give his parents a better quality of life.  He appears in the picture with the moto-taxi he would like to repair.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eileen Gessner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":542068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repair and maintenance of a mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agust\u00edn Dar\u00edo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":65.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":69.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.27},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.22,"local_amount":55.54,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695213,"comment":null},{"amount":22.95,"local_amount":57.39,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":65.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878259,"comment":null},{"amount":23.89,"local_amount":59.72,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618287,"comment":null},{"amount":24.23,"local_amount":60.58,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832686,"comment":null},{"amount":25.56,"local_amount":63.89,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":72.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099293,"comment":null},{"amount":26.27,"local_amount":65.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554703,"comment":null},{"amount":26.99,"local_amount":67.48,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":76.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530115,"comment":null},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":69.73,"processed_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":79.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666259,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T20:42:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201576,"name":"Angela Marilu","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela de 20 a\u00f1os, vive en el Guasmo de Guayaquil como una microempresaria ya que una de sus actividades econ\u00f3micas es la de hacer manualidades a base de formix.\n\nComenz\u00f3 a realiza mu\u00f1ecos de fomix desde que sali\u00f3 del colegio.

He lives with his mother, Ana, who is 41, and his father, Elmer, who is 43, and with his three siblings in their home.  On their farmland, you can see their extensive plantings of coffee and plantains. He has been doing this for 3 years, when he started to work with his father, hiring workers to facilitate the farmwork. One of the activities he most enjoys is harvesting the plantains, because he collects them bunch by bunch. On the other hand, he dislikes transporting his products for long hours of travel to the markets where they don't consider the exact price that the production should cost. Gennsi is sure of the quality of his products and that is why he always finds the best bidder \"if I just sell at what they offer I can't make what my harvests are worth\", he affirms. That is why he always seeks to have wholesale purchasing friends. With time, he hopes to buy his own land and plant in large quantities. He also wants to build his house in the city, because he is planning on starting a family. This is his third loan with MFP, and since he is a member of the board of directors, he likes to work actively in his community group and for the other members to participate. With the loan he is asking for, he will buy 20 sacks of fertilizer to protect his plantings, as well as hire workers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":542078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 20 bags of fertilizer and to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gennsi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3054.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588122,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T01:26:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201581,"name":"Medio Ejido (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco comunal Medio Ejido lo conforman  ocho socias que buscan con su trabajo mejorar y crecer en su negocio al igual que con sus familias; est\u00e1 ubicado en la  ciudad de Cuenca  urbe dividida en dos partes por el r\u00edo Tomebamba, demarcando el centro hist\u00f3rico al norte con sus hermosas casas hasta el barranco y la moderna al sur con barrios residenciales, edificios, centros comerciales y amplias avenidas, que hacen de esta ciudad un lugar que atrae al turista nacional y extranjero.\n\nBanesa es oriunda de la provincia de Manab\u00ed  migro a esta ciudad, vive en el sector Medio Ejido  en una casa arrendada con su pareja  que trabaja como ayudante en bus interprovincial y sus dos hijos de 8 y 5 a\u00f1os respectivamente, los ni\u00f1os cursan la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica en establecimientos de la ciudad,  ella  comparte su tiempo entre la venta   por cat\u00e1logo de ropa, perfumes, bisuter\u00eda y m\u00e1s desde hace un a\u00f1o y medio y los quehaceres del  hogar, tambi\u00e9n  prepara comidas para fechas especiales seg\u00fan pedido y esta actividad  realiza hace 6 a\u00f1os.\n\nEste es  su primer cr\u00e9dito y con el dinero comprar\u00e1 pantalones, camisas, blusas, perfumes, cremas, maquillajes, aretes, collares, pulseras y m\u00e1s para su exigente clientela.\n\nSu meta es  volver a su tierra natal comprarse un terreno y construir su casa propia. \n\nMar\u00eda Gabriela  C.  tiene 24 a\u00f1os es casada fruto de su uni\u00f3n concibi\u00f3 tres hijos quienes se encuentran de 6, 5, 1 a\u00f1o,  sus dos  primeras hijas estudian  en una  escuela de la ciudad, gracias al trabajo conjunto lograron edificar su casa propia donde tienen una panader\u00eda y pasteler\u00eda y trabjan tanto esposo y ella  gracias a que su c\u00f3nyuge le ense\u00f1o esta actividad.  \n\nEs socia del banco comunal Medio Ejido motivada por su hermana y este es  su primer credito, con el dinero que recibir\u00e1 va abastecer su negocio con harina, manteca, levadura, az\u00facar y otros insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n del pan y pasteles.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es salir adelante con su esposo y agrandar su negocio para dar trabajo a otras personas de la comunidad.\n","en":"The community bank Medio Ejido is made up of eight members, who are are seeking with their work to improve and grow their business, as well as with their families.

Wool items from llamas, alpacas and vicu\u00f1as [a llama relative] are especially sought after. There is a large variety of silver items; the finer the work, the higher the price. There are original tin items ranging from match holders to luxurious cutlery. The tin, neatly worked, is very strong and, in contrast to the silver, does not cloud with the passing of time). Sagarnaga Street is in the center of the city of La Paz. Geovanna started this activity when she was very young, since her mother did this work, and now Geovanna has her own resources and works a lot so that her business will grow. She has a young daughter who always accompanies her. Geovanna lives with her mother, and they both help her very much. The requested loan is for the purchase of multicoloured fabric and wool for making bags and other products that she offers at her stall.\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br

For over 20 years she has lived in the home that her mother left her, which is 20 minutes from the city center. She works in a medical institute as an administrative secretary, and she also sells supplies and lingerie on credit. Marcela and her husband, Miguel, have two daughters; one is adolescent and the younger one is three years old. Miguel works at the Don Bosco Editorial. Marcela is a young, hard-working person. She sells her products especially to her neighbours and co-workers. One of her greatest wishes is to see her daughters as professionals, and this is the main motivation that brings her to work and makes her so responsible with her family and work. She has worked with our institution for two years. She previously worked in a group named Resplandecer, but this group separated and the members later worked alone. In all this time she has demonstrated herself to be a very punctual person with her repayments. With the requested loan she will buy wholesale merchandise.

She has her own home, for which she had to work very hard since she acquired it through financing. She will use the sought after loan to buy winter clothes since the seasons are about to change. She is grateful for the opportunity offered her by this institution as it has offered her financial support without too much paperwork.

Her business is called \"Bodega Yacky.\"  She still remembers that when she arrived in the area, there was no electricity or running water and there were very few houses.  Little by little the population grew, and with it the needs of the people.  She decided to open a small place in her house and began selling \"marcianos,\" or ice cream, and sodas.  Later she stocked up on other things that were requested until now she has a a larger store next to this and she has been able to save and build a house where she is projecting that she will put another store with a grocery mini-market.  She would also like to establish another business selling fruit.  Currently she is venturing into the sale of beer at wholesale for social events.  Irene is happy that thanks to the loans of EDAPROSPO she has been able to see her business grow.  With her previous loans she could buy a freezer, display case, and refrigerator - which have been indispensable for her business.  With this opportunity she will use her loan to buy beer and continue with the business that she began recently.

They live in a home they own in the Ayacuchan rain forest located in the town of San Francisco. Alejandra dreamed of getting a degree in agriculture, but she ended up making a living selling food. She was a farmer during her youth, but she opened up her food stand offering typical regional dishes because she always wanted to do something on her own. Of course more than once she suffered terrible setbacks, but she knew how to get back up. She created her own seasoning, made a variety of typical dishes and sold all kinds of meals to her customers, and in this way she steadily grew her business. To her family she was revolutionary, and thus feels happy and satisfied with what she has achieved so far. In general, her stand is run out of her home. That's why she wants to expand her restaurant in the future, with the goal of attracting more customers. This is Alejandra's fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to continuing fulfilling her payments in the established periods. Furthermore, she feels satisfied with her community bank group. With the loan she is requesting, she plans to purchase more materials and ingredients to maker her meals as well as remodel her storefront.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty

She has four children, ages 13, 11, 9 and 6. Yolis was helping her sister tend to a store, but because of the little income she was making she decided to go out on her own. She started adapting her home's living room to convert it into a small store, and she purchased supplies and a display case. Out of this good decision, she now has a stocked store called \"Despensa Ver\u00f3nica\" that sells all kinds of merchandise. She works from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. every day. Her sons help out when they get back from school because she is expecting another baby, which makes moving difficult. With the loan, she plans to purchase paint, cement and bricks to build a better house. In the future she wants to enlarge her business and for her sons to work with her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Over time she became tired, so she decided to resign and with her severance pay she purchased a variety of merchandise to open her own store so she could continue supporting her two children along with her husband, who works as a designer and also has supported her store. For Magda, it has not been easy because she had to attract customers and make advertisements for her friends and neighbors to sell Avon products, with which she is affiliated. She sells those products via catalogs, but she also keeps actual items to sell to businesses on credit. She has invested in her merchandise and has been able to attract customers. The problem with these types of products is that if they are damaged they cannot be returned and it goes as a loss for her. With this loan she plans to purchase more cosmetics to be able to be prepared for this month of Mother's Day, such as perfumes, creams, lotions and clothing to increase her inventory and earn more profits so she can cover basic expenses for her household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":542195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase cosmetics and clothing to increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magda Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.4,"local_amount":1027.97,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1090.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822100,"comment":null},{"amount":50.4,"local_amount":1007.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562119,"comment":null},{"amount":50.37,"local_amount":1007.39,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771026,"comment":null},{"amount":50.32,"local_amount":1006.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204918,"comment":null},{"amount":50.28,"local_amount":1005.66,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1067.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330614,"comment":null},{"amount":50.19,"local_amount":1003.88,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465769,"comment":null},{"amount":97.04,"local_amount":1940.75,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2059.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097908,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T21:25:35Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201631,"name":"Elvia Soledad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elvia de 62 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana en el Guasmo de Guayaquil, es viuda pero tiene tres hijos de 42, 33 y 31 a\u00f1os, hace 22 a\u00f1os atras falleci\u00f3 su esposo y tuvo que ingeniarse un plan para que sus hijos terminaran de estudiar, aunque sus ahorros no eran muchos Elvia los invirti\u00f3 en v\u00edveres y los empezo a vender en las afuera de su casa. \n\nPoco a poco con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n Elvia tuvo ingresos para una peque\u00f1a tienda y asi darle una mejor vida a sus hijos, en la actualidad trabaja desde las 06h30am hasta las 23:00pm todos los dias.

After the group had existed for seven years and the women had gained experience in group organization, they approached the micro-finance institution, CAURIE-MF, to make use of their financial services.   Thus, on April 29, 2010, they became a Banc Villageois with the same name as their group and the village. They received their first loan on May 17, 2010 when they were inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of the members are married and have at least two children; the average age of the women is 40. \r\n\r\nThe President of the Banc Villageois, Madame Awa N., is 47 and has four children. She farms livestock and plans to use her loan to buy four goats, which she will raise for at least four months before selling them in the large weekly market in her village.  She has been doing this for three years. In order to reduce feeding costs, she collects hay at the end of the rainy season and dries it so that it keeps better. Her goal is to help improve her family's standard of living by contributing to the cost of food, health care and clothing for her children.

like other members of the ASHI center where 35-year-old Esperanza P. is a member, she also raises pigs in her backyard for breeding and fattening. Once her gilt (mother pig) gives birth, piglets will be raised and fattened for four months and thereafter sold either alive or slaughtered. Loans she avails of through her membership in ASHI finance the purchase of food and required vaccinations for her piglets and pigs until they are grown and ready to be disposed. Profit she gains out of this business is a great help in supporting her dream of uplifting her family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nEsperanza\u2019s husband is a village councilor, and his honorarium received every month is too small to cover the needs of his family, especially once their three children, whose ages now are from 8 to 11, have to go to college. With that, Esperanza\u2019s ability to avail of loans through ASHI is a great opportunity for her to grow her small backyard hog-breeding business into a piggery. Some of her proceeds will be saved to finance her ambition of building a concrete house for the safety of her family.\r\n

Ricardo makes a living repairing all kinds of shoes, from dress shoes to sneakers.  He also shines shoes.  He sets up his stand just outside the El Transito market, a site that he has used for many years and where he is well known among local people.  Because he is well known in the area, he can count on certain customers coming to him over and over for shoe repairs or shoe shines.  Ricardo is a hard-working and responsible man who understands the importance of providing a good service to his customers, service that is friendly and welcoming.  He is applying for a loan so that he can buy glue, tacks, soles and the other supplies that he needs for the business.  With the supplies, he will be able to provide a better service to his customer and, in turn, increase his earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Gloria es una mujer muy trabajadora la cual se dedica a la venta de cortinas, sabanas, manteles y otros m\u00e1s, los cuales comercializa de forma ambulante, lo que es de mucho beneficio para ella ya que le permite abarcar diferentes zonas, por lo que vende m\u00e1s, su hijo mayor la acompa\u00f1a a vender sus productos lo que es muy positivo para ella, ya que pueden cargar mayor cantidad de cortinas, sabanas y manteles. Es por medio de esta venta como Gloria logra solventar todos los gastos familiares, incluso en los momentos en que su esposo carece de trabajo. Ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo por medio del cual pueda comprar mayor cantidad de productos de manera que sus ventas aumenten ya que no solo es este su objetivo sino tambi\u00e9n contar con los recursos necesario para poder conectar el agua potable a su hogar, ya que en la actualidad no cuentan con ese servicio lo que los obliga a ir a un chorro p\u00fablico y llevar el agua en cantaros sobre la cabeza hasta su hogar, esto les beneficiar\u00e1 ya que les permitir\u00e1 contar con algo tan necesario y esencia que es el agua.","en":"Gloria Esperanza C. A., 38, lives in the town of Cojutepeque in the Salvadoran \"departamento\" of Cuscatlan.  She lives there with her husband, a construction worker, who works during the time of year when building projects are viable.  They have three children, 17-, 12- and 8-years old.  Gloria is a hard-working woman who operates a business selling curtains, sheets, tablecloths, etc.  She works as a street vendor, an advantage for her because she can move from place to place and sell more of her products as she goes.  Her son works with her, another advantage because together they can carry more curtains, sheets, etc. than she can carry alone.  The business has made it possible for Gloria to pay the family's bills even  when her husband has been unable to find work.  She is applying for a loan so that she can buy wholesale supplies of her products and, in turn, increase her income.  Increasing her income is not only an end in itself, but also her means for pulling together the money she needs to connect the family's house to a source of clean water.  For now, the house isn't connected to a supply of clean water and the family has to get its water from a public pump and carry it home in jugs.  The loan will help the family hugely because they will ultimately be able to use it to get something essential to everyone: clean water.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a noble worker dedicated to raising animals, primarily cattle, which he buys and sells in the most commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what Saidullo has enjoyed most since he was young. Nevertheless, he also has another job; in his free time, he also provides taxi driver service. Saidullo requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his cattle. His goal is to increase his product and thereby increase his household income in addition to being solvent in order to continue working on his buying and selling animals.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ten years ago, with the initial investment of 1000 soms ($21.83), her husband began to cultivate strawberries to sell. In this way he makes 6,000 soms ($131) a month. This made it possible for them to buy a one-room flat. Now they want to get a loan to purchase fertilizer. In the future, Saltanata dreams of buying a big house.\r\n\r\nKairkul A. is the treasurer of the group. She is 39 and married. She works as a retail packager and her husband is a private driver.

Only strong people are capable of overcoming such psychological troubles and of making themselves focus on work while hoping for a change to the patter. Reading this group\u2019s story, it becomes clear that many such strong people may be found next to us every day.\r\n\r\nMira I. is this group\u2019s leader. She is 43 years old. She is the mother of three children. The oldest daughter is 18 years old; the middle child, a son, is 14; and the youngest daughter is only seven. Initially, Mira had chosen a fairly traditional profession for herself\u2014grammar school teacher. Yet in today\u2019s conditions when civil servants are hardly getting paid, it has become necessary for her to find an additional source of income. This is how Mira\u2019s husband became a farmer, and Mira has been helping her husband as much as she could. Getting used to a new professional occupation is not easy. Yet Mira was firmly set on improving her family\u2019s life conditions and she had no choice but to learn a new trade. By now she and her husband no longer need to consult others about the right steps to follow when planting and growing their crops. Mira has requested this loan as she and her husband need to buy diesel fuel at wholesale prices. They are really hoping to be able to obtain this loan and to purchase fuel. \r\n\r\nOther members of Mira\u2019s group:\r\n\r\nAltynbek Z. is 25 years old. He is already married and has a son, born just a month ago. Altynbek\u2019s sister, to whom he helps with expenses, also lives with the family. In order to support his family, Altynbek works as an informatics teacher. In addition, he is actively working in agriculture. He needs a loan to purchase diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nGulzat T. is 43 years old. She is a widow, raising three children on her own. She does agricultural work in order to support her family. Right now she has a pressing need for fuel, but she lacks the financial means for it.

Not everything goes smoothly and happens the way we want it. However, life itself is a great source of relaxation for people who possess imagination and creativity. Nobody is obliged to suffer and be an outsider.\r\n\r\nAnarkul T., the leader of this group, had faced quite a big ordeal when she divorced her husband as she still had to provide a living for her two children and her daughter was very little at that moment. However, Anarkul decided to accept things as they were and just keep going.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, right after her divorce, she made a decision to come to the capital and she started her own business. It was not that easy since she had a little child to take care of. She remembered her old skill of making traditional blankets and pillows. She started selling blankets, pillows and other hand made articles, and over the past years she has managed to provide for herself a stable income.\r\n\r\nShe has big plans of opening a factory to produce blankets and pillows. She believes that this factory would at least provide some women with jobs. Now Anarkul needs this loan to invest money in producing blankets and pillows, to purchase wadding and for quilting.\r\n\r\nAnarkul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nMeerim I., 29, is married and has a son. Her husband works as a policeman. Meerim works for the net marketing company Oriflame. Meerim and her husband need a loan to buy two calves to raise.\r\n\r\nAnara B., 54, is a mother of three children. She sells detergents and soft drinks and manages to earn around $200. Her husband is a farmer. Their children help Anara work in a shop. Anara hopes to obtain this loan and invest it in increasing the turnover and assortment of goods for sale. \r\n\r\nDarika K., 47, is a widow. She is the mother of three children. Her son works as a salesman and helps Darika to provide for the family. Darika sells different kinds of consumer\u2019s goods. Now she needs a loan to purchase paints and make some repairs at home. \r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n \r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Arcelita R. has proven her reproductive role as a woman. She gave birth to five loving children from her husband Ricardo. All throughout her 25 years of motherhood and 26 years of married life, she has had no other intention but to help her husband support the needs of their children and provide them with a life that is enjoyable and worth living. Therefore, in 2004 she took the opportunity to enhance her capability to becoming productive. She joined ASHI and the loan she has able to avail was her means to establishing her own livelihood, which is hog\/pig fattening and\/or breeding. The piglets are fattened and some will be sold. Her fattened hogs are sold to market and to people in their village either slaughtered or alive after four months. \r\n\r\nArcelita and her family enjoy the profit her business is gaining. It is a huge help to augment her husband\u2019s small amount of honorarium for being the village councilor. Through her membership in ASHI, by maintaining a very good performance in terms of repayment, and attendance at ASHI weekly center meeting, Arcelita wishes to take more loans to be able to have the opportunity to grow her business and earn more profit. This will be her means to support the needs of her four children who have stopped studying, though she still hopes that they will decide to go back to school and finish their studies until college just like her eldest

He finished 8th grade but had to drop school when her parents forced her to marry her first husband, when she was only a teenager. She later married again and got divorced. She lives with her two daughters who are 24 and 25, both students, and a granddaughter.\r\nAfter her divorce she started building the house they reside now. She works as a seamstress and also has a tent from where she sells food products. She learned to sew with her father. Her biggest selling products are school uniforms, but that's seasonal (she only sells them in the beginning of the year). With her food stand she's able to make around U$86 per month, especially on weekends and at the end of the month. \r\n\r\nThis is Ana's first loan with Hluvuku, and she has never worked with any other bank. She heard of the institution from a friend who's also a client. With her loan, she hopes to buy more fabric, and also improve the variety of products offered in her tent. She would like to eventually sell meat cuts and snacks. Her dream is to open more stores in other neighborhoods. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

For the last three years, he has worked as a farmer growing vegetables. This is the only thing he knows how to do and it is what he likes most. For Kutbiddin, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the crops of his labor grow year after year. In addition, Kutbiddin raises cattle. His family helps him with his business. \r\n<br>Now, Kutbiddin wants to borrow money to purchase seeds and fertilizer in order to grow seasonal vegetables.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 38 years old, unmarried but sheltering five children who are under her care. Three of them attend school and two are not yet old enough.\r\n\r\nMunyerekane B. runs a tailoring workshop named \u201cMama Jaquy (tailor\/designer)\u201d. Her workshop is located in the Himbi II borough, on W. Avenue.

May, June and July are crisis periods for most tailors and seamstresses.\r\n\r\nMunyerekane B. intends to diversify her activities through the retail commerce of general tailoring supplies, which she finds in Kampala, Uganda. In the future her ambition is to buy a plot of land in South Kivu, in Uvira, a town bordering Bujumbura in Burundi.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to thank the Hekima MFI for the loans she has been granted without any collateral, because thanks to these she has been able to take charge of her life, avoid the temptations coming from men, and protect herself from immorality and prostitution.

Since she was young, she dreamed of being a veterinarian, and she is enrolled in a school in the city that allows her to study, work with cows, spend time with her daughter, and work with her parents to produce milk, since they have a cooling tank to hold the milk and bring it to PIL.\r\n\r\nShe is a very responsible person who is dedicated to the work that she does, since her parents taught her as a child how to work hard.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eileen Gessner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":542620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872821,"comment":null},{"amount":212.44,"local_amount":212.44,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":212.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612853,"comment":null},{"amount":87.56,"local_amount":87.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":87.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093461,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385263,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523319,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657825,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401077,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195819396,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262064,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T22:55:40Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201822,"name":"Aidah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aidah is a single mother of one and her child goes to school.

\u201csac\u00f3 la mano\u201d y ella quiere reemplazarlo, por eso est\u00e1 solicitando su tercer cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo por valor de $1.800.000.\n\nLilia Esther es viuda y tiene 7 hijos de 33 a 59 a\u00f1os de edad, ella  desde sus 20 a\u00f1os lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla procedente de Cartagena con una hija de 2 a\u00f1os y la ilusi\u00f3n de mejorar sus ingresos trabajando inicialmente como empleada dom\u00e9stica;  tiempo despu\u00e9s, se comprometi\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge y tuvo sus otros hijos, compro su primera casa y  desde all\u00ed comenz\u00f3 a preparar y vender alimentos como  sopas, hayacas y fritos, finalmente  adquiri\u00f3 una casa mas amplia en el barrio Santa Mar\u00eda, donde aun vive hace mas de 35 a\u00f1os. Lilia es un ejemplar mujer que con su empuje para el negocio, logr\u00f3 criar 7 hijos con muy buenas costumbres, ense\u00f1\u00e1ndole principalmente la honestidad y el valor por el trabajo.\n\nHace casi tres a\u00f1os impulsada por su hija, que tambi\u00e9n es clienta de la Fundaci\u00f3n, se acerc\u00f3 a conocer sus programas y desde entonces ha recibido 2 cr\u00e9ditos, con ellos ha ampliado su negocio y adquiri\u00f3 mejores ingresos para satisfacer las necesidades del hogar. Sue\u00f1a con que algunos de sus hijos, que aun no tienen una casa propia, puedan gozar de un bien  familiar y tiene como meta organizar f\u00edsicamente  su negocio realizando algunos arreglos locativos.\nSus mayores desaf\u00edos est\u00e1n relacionados con las temporadas altas y bajas, a las que siempre debe estar atenta, porque en las altas se incrementan sus ingresos pero tambi\u00e9n su trabajo y debe ahorrar, para que en \u201c\u00e9pocas de vacas flacas\u201d o temporadas bajas, ella pueda resolver sus necesidades y no quedarle mal a nadie.\n","en":"In the neighbourhood of Santa Mar\u00eda, south west of Barranquilla, everyone joins together to raise money to make the area more attractive and bring in new customers who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have visited. This is the environment in which 71-year old Lilia Esther C. and her family work. They live very close to a place called \u201cLa Cascada\u201d where political meetings and activities like Mothers Day celebrations are held. All these visitors have a beneficial impact on Lilia\u2019s sales of general goods and soft drinks. At the moment she has no refrigeration system as her freezer has broken down, so she wishes to replace it. For this reason she is asking for her third loan with Kiva partner, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.\r\n\r\nLilia Esther is a widow and has seven children aged 33 to 59 years. In her twenties she moved from Cartagena to Banrranqullia with her 2-year old daughter and the dream of increasing her income. At first she worked as a domestic servant. Some time later she got married and had her other children. She bought her first house and began cooking and selling food such as soup, hayacas (meat wrapped in cornmeal dough and banana leaves), and fried items. Later she bought a larger house in Santa Mar\u00eda where she has lived now for 35 years. Lilia is a role model with her business drive and her well-mannered seven children. While she was bringing them up, she taught them honesty and the value of work. \r\n\r\nEncouraged by her daughter (who is also a client of the Foundation), about three years ago Lilia learned more about its programs and since that time has had two loans. She has used the money to expand her business and thus earn more money to cover household expenses. Her dream is that those of her children who do not yet have a home of their own will one day have their own house. Her goal is to make some physical changes to her business. High and low seasons give her some problems as her income is higher at certain times of the year. During those times she has to work harder and make sure she saves money for the tough times so she has enough to live on and not cause problems for anyone.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Mart\u00ednez has watched her family cut out, assemble, finish parts, and then turn them into stylish women\u2019s clothing, or school uniforms, or children\u2019s outfits. Ever since she was a young girl, she has been learning how to do this art, and now as an adult, it has become a profitable business providing her main income. She lives in Sabanagrande, west of the municipality of Atl\u00e1ntico. Because of her knowledge and creativity she also makes quilts, pillowcases, and ornaments for the different seasons of the year. \r\n\r\nThe loans that Argemira has received from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation have allowed her to improve the quality of her products. She was able to buy the right sort of sewing machine. Now she is asking for a loan to buy the materials needed to make children\u2019s outfits, and spare parts to improve the sewing machine. \r\n\r\nArgemira\u2019s goal is take her quality products to other towns so she becomes better-known and sells more items. Her challenge is to find the time to keep on improving her work to which she is devoted. She also has financial difficulties but she always overcomes them through work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

She has a second hand clothes business, in a street market about 30 minutes from her house. She has several clients that know her products and don't hesitate in buying from her, and in the top of that she also travels to the city once a week where she sells to stores. What she likes more about the used clothes business is that she gets twice the products for the price, and she's able to sell clothes cheaper to her loyal clients.\r\n\r\nShe's been doing this for the past 8 years, and the only thing she's not too happy about is the traveling because she doesn't like to leave her children, but the money she makes in the city is better than in her hometown. She plans on opening her own clothing store in the city. \r\n\r\nThis is the 6th loan Tania has had with MFP, and she promises to pay it back with the same punctuality as always, so she can apply for more loans. She's a very responsible client and committed to the organization of her group. The money asked will be translated into more clothes and the improvement of her business, as she wants to have more options and quantity of clothes to offer her clients.\r\n\r\n<br

Her business is the sale of kitchen utensils and linen-goods in general in an informal (street) market. In this manner, her work begins at 8:00am and lasts until 2:00pm.  She also sells items by order, to be delivered once the product is paid for.\r\n\r\nMaria is content with what she does, especially with this type of sales, since it permits her to accumulate good profits.  What she likes most about her business is that she stays busy and occupied with her customers.  Nonetheless, having to assemble and disassemble her stall daily is heavy work, in part because she has to take care not to damage merchandise, especially the glass or clay products.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she wants, in the future, to install a store in her own home to be able to sell her products more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis is her 6th loan with MFP, and she promises to continue making her payments according to schedule.

Carmen sells lingerie and kitchen items for a living, in an informal market near her neighborhood.  She works everyday from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon.  She sells her wares on credit and once her customers finish paying her she gives them the item, except for underwear, which she sells on the spot.  She is satisfied with her work, mostly with selling things since it allows her to earn good money.  The thing she likes most about her business is the way it keeps her busy most of the time and spending time with her customers. Although her difficulties appear when she takes out or puts away the china and glass she has in her stall because they are very fragile.  She has been in sales for seventeen years and in the future would like to set up a store to sells clothes and wares to improve her working conditions.  This is Carmen's sixth loan with MFP and she reaffirms her promise to continue to pay on time.  In addition, she is a responsible member who is concerned for the the group's well being and development.  With the loan, she will buy more lingerie and wares since she has orders to fill, and hopes to meet her customers needs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":542701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":375.6},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":384.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":413.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":425.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":445.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":467.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":488.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.08},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.51},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.59,"local_amount":375.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":381.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934543,"comment":null},{"amount":285.85,"local_amount":797.71,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":810.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673314,"comment":null},{"amount":312.12,"local_amount":871.04,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":885.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154150,"comment":null},{"amount":167.56,"local_amount":467.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":475.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449461,"comment":null},{"amount":174.88,"local_amount":488.05,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":495.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588138,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:36:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201866,"name":"Adegboye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cet homme de 32 ans est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 02 enfants.

His wife sells fruit and they have 2 children - 18 and 16. Years ago Jos\u00e9 was a bricklayer and suffered an accident which disfigured his face. Little by little, with surgery, he became healthier but has needed money to maintain his family. He decided to invest his last savings in tubes and patches, with the goal of becoming a tyre repairer (a person who fixes bicycles). Little by little Jos\u00e9 saved his capital and purchased more tools for his business. He actually also fixes car tyres. Jos\u00e9 works from 6am to 9pm every day. One of the difficulties he has in his work are the crutches that he uses due to the accident. With the loan he is seeking he will buy patches, tubes and tyres for his business.

Tamara is 66 years old and lives in the urban subdivision of La Playa, which is ten minutes away from the main universities of Barranquilla.  She is married and has nine children between the ages of 28 and 49.  Her main source of income is from her general store-bakery called \u201cThe Best Bakery\u201d.  She needs to buy materials and supplies such as flour, a display case, and primarily sugar.  Part of the money will be used to pay off the loan she used to buy a refrigerator case which she desperately needed to neatly store soft drinks, fresh fruits, sausages, and dairy products that she sells in her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAura arrived in Barranquilla ten years ago from Carmen de Bolivar.  She previously had a bakery and store in Carmen de Bolivar, but she later opened a drugstore and bakery in a neighborhood in southern Barranquilla.  That business did not do well because it was situated in a location that was not very secure.  She became very fearful after being robbed and decided to cease operation.  Two years ago, Aura decided to go back into business by acquiring a bakery for her daughter that is located in a nice house that her brother rents.  Here she decided to continue with her bakery business and is now the owner of \u201cThe Best Bakery\u201d, which is already registered with the Chamber of Commerce.  She assumed full control of her business in La Playa, a place that experiences a lot of fishing because of its close proximity to the sea.  Aura's daughter assists her and she also has one employee who prepares the breads.  The business is well-known among her customers for the quality of her baked goods including sweet bread, pineapple bread, buttered bread, toast, and puddings.  The nice fresh flavor and unique smell of warm bread made every afternoon awakens the desire to eat it, which is why her customers come back for more.  Being in a good location has also been a key to her success.  She is now located in a strategic area in the neighborhood of Adelita Char.  The old adage \u201csells like hotcakes\u201d now applies very well to her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSince receiving her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Aura has been able to establish her working capital and reopen her business.  Most of all, she was able to integrate her family into a productive activity.  Her greatest wish and main challenge is to expand her business and open a variety store so that other relatives can work in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

She has a 19 year old son who attends university and her dream is to see him complete his studies and succeed in his career.\r\n\r\nAna has been working with \" Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\" since 2002.  She knows when it's the best time to request loans because she is well aware of how much she earns and how much she should save.  She began her relationship in order to increase her inventory of articles of clothing, and be able to deliver within her neighborhood and at a furniture store, where she is currently employed.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan in order to be able to make improvements to her bathroom and repair the walls around her patio to improve the security of her home.  She was able to make other improvements with the money from her past loans and her goal is to continue making improvements until her home is adequate.  She is asking for a loan of 1,200,000 COP ($625).\r\n\r\nAna lives in a commercialized zone, located in the southwest of the city, very near religious communities dedicated to community development and supported by international organizations.  They have helped improve her neighborhood and made it possible for many other people to study, start businesses, and improve their family relations; in other words, improving lives.\r\n<br

A. is 37 years old and a native of Carmen de Bolivar, which is where he and his father own farmland on which they grow cassava and yams.  From a young age, he has come to know and appreciate the delight associated with these two products since they form the basis of his main business that he developed in the town of Soledad.  There he lives with his family, which consists of his wife and ten year old son.\r\n<p>\r\nJailer wakes up every morning at 5am and delivers his products by motorcycle to 25 stores that make up his existing customer base.  Throughout the morning he distributes cassava and yams that he harvested, as well as the famous \u201ccarmero\u201d avocado that is grown in Carmen de Bolivar.  \r\n<p>\r\nJailer may not always have yams and cassava to sell from either his land or his father\u2019s, so he also buys sheep in Monter\u00eda when necessary.  He wants to take advantage of his trips to Monter\u00eda by seizing the opportunity to sell yams, cassava, and avocados while he is there.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (which he joined two years ago) in the amount of 2,000,000 COP.  He will buy 50 sturdy bags filled with cassava, yams, and carmero avocados so that he can sell his products in the markets where his suppliers are located.\r\n<p>\r\nJailer started this business after he quit his job at the central municipal supply depot, where he worked an extensive schedule from 3am to 8pm, which was made worse by the low pay.  Due to the exhaustion and the lack of time to devote to his family, he decided to become independent and start selling vegetables, tomato plants, and avocados.  He is always looking for better ways to earn more income and eventually became acquainted with several shopkeepers who started ordering yams, cassava, and avocados from him.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince joining Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Jailer has been able to upgrade his means of transportation from a bicycle to a motorcycle so that he can travel with cargo, access more customers, and sell more of his products because credit was available to him.  Otherwise, he would have had difficulty traveling to his suppliers and would have eventually lost credibility in the marketplace.  He is now more comfortable working with credit and dreams of seeing his son become a professional and looking up to him.  In the future, he hopes to own a distribution truck so that he can sell basic necessities throughout Barranquilla and in other towns in the district of Atl\u00e1ntico.  \r\n<br

Parents use their financial means with the purpose to send children to schools, colleges and universities and also teach their children what they know so that their children can support themselves when they are older. Competition is everywhere and to secure your own \"place under the sun\" one has to be the best in their business. At this very difficult for Kyrgyztan time it's very pleasant to see positive changes amongst simple folk in entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nAsylkul Y. is a leader of this group. Asylkul has been doing farming for the past sixteen years as well as raising six daughters. Her oldest daughters help her in any way they can and Asylkul is also able to do animal husbandry. Asylkul's husband helps her with this, who also works as a driver. Earlier her husband had some experience in agriculture. Asylkul has learned agriculture from his experience. At this time the oldest daughter is 22 years old and second oldest daughter is 20. The rest of her daughters go to school. Asylkul dreams about buying a house in Bishkek so that her daughters could get a higher education in the city. Right now Asylkul is 45 years old, she is full of life and wants her children to have a different life ahead. Asylkul very much hopes to receive this loan and invest it in fuel and potato seeds.\r\n\r\nAsylkul's group partners are:\r\n\r\nToichubek T. is 43 years old. He is a member of the farmers union. Toichubek has four children. His wife has to work so that they can feed their family. They do farming together. Right now their children study in university and family's expenses are growing. Toichubek has asked for a loan to buy fuel.\r\n\r\nAnara Anurova is 33 years old. Anara's husband works as a director with one of the international development projects. Anara is a mother of two children. She is not the one who stays at home and waits for the husband to bring money home. Anara does agriculture. She has good experience of sixteen years. She did not want to wait for her husband to give her the necessary amount of money. She hopes to receive this loan to buy fuel.\r\n\r\nMira B.-K. is 37 years old. Her husband works as an excavator driver and Mira works as a controller. Their salary is only enough to support the family, but is not enough for other expenses. Mira and her husband decided to start doing animal husbandry. Right now she needs a loan which will help them buy a cow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Bortnikoff, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":542966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fuel and seeds of potatoes for farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T05:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asylkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Toichubek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5937},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6211},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6542},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6768},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7114},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":7428}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.87,"local_amount":5937,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5953.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931689,"comment":null},{"amount":135.87,"local_amount":6211,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6228.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670701,"comment":null},{"amount":143.1,"local_amount":6542,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6560.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884349,"comment":null},{"amount":148.05,"local_amount":6768,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6787.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151480,"comment":null},{"amount":155.62,"local_amount":7114,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446504,"comment":null},{"amount":162.49,"local_amount":7428,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7449.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585674,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T04:08:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":201999,"name":"Mrs. Sim Un Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seventeen people make up this village bank loan and they are living in Angk Khlaeu village in Kandal province.

She is 55 years old and the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nZenaida is widowed and has 2 school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Zenaida has been involved in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Zenaida joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zenaida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase new items to expand product offering. Zenaida is requesting a new loan, her 13th, of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to increase working capital. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":538592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Gonzaga Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa G. is from the village of Mamanga Daku. She is 51 years old and the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosa is married and has 4 adult-aged children. She owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily snacks and other delicacies, in the local community. Rosa has been involved in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Rosa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Rosa is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":538548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rivalry and competition make people strive to be the best in their fields and professions. Weak people get afraid to lose their positions and begin to feel themselves psychologically backward or weaker than others. However, among ordinary people we can still find many examples of strong-willed people, who not only do not get afraid, but go into business with full enthusiasm and energy, and quickly grow in prosperity. Daily obstacles and life ordeals cannot prevent these people from achieving their goals as they are mature minded and know that after the darkness of night comes the light of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeishebubu M. is the leader of this group. She is fifty eight and has two children. Her husband used to be a farmer. Beishebubu\u2019s two sons are grown ups. The elder son is thirty five and the younger is thirty. Both of her sons make their own living independently. Beishebubu obtains her sons\u2019 support. However, she prefers to stay independent and, using the skills she acquired from her husband, she decided to be a farmer. Now she is working in the field, sowing and planting vegetables in a piece of land. Beishebubu needs a loan to buy fuel for field works. \r\n\r\nBeishebubu\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nJuzumkan A., 71, has a daughter. Her daughter lives in the capital. She and her husband still work. Both of them are farmers. Now is the time when they are busy every day sowing in the field. Juzumkan needs a loan to purchase fuel. \r\n\r\nBaktybek K., 59, has a son. Baktybek and his wife are farmers. They also raise some cattle. In the fall they plan to marry their son who is thirty five and still single. Baktybek hopes to obtain this loan and invest the funds in increasing their livestock population. \r\n\r\nBermet J., 52, has a son. Bermet, her husband and son are engaged in farming. Bermet wants her son to become a big farmer, and therefore actively involves her son in all aspects of the work. These days the whole family is busy working in the field. Bermet needs a loan to buy fuel. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).
