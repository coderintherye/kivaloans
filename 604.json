At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her children's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercily operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Mercily earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMercily hopes to be able to expand her business soon and eventually become a big convenience store.  She also prays for good health to be enjoyed by everybody in her house.

Her mixed farm produces milk, maize, and beans which are all sold to the local market. Farming has been her main source of income.\r\n\r\nJane has requested this loan of 31,200 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The proceeds from the sale of milk will help her pay school fees for her four children who are currently attending school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a widow and mother to two children, one married and one already working. She manages her household while operating her business. She also employs a helper in the store. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n<br>Jocelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jocelyn earns an income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. Her store is open 24 hours a day, unlike other stores in the community. She also sells repacked charcoal as an alternative to LPG for cooking and she also has e-load phone credits for sale at her store. She earns a minimum of 1,200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and e-load credits to increase her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<br>Jocelyn hopes to find a good location for her business and eventually be a dealer of grocery and other products in her community.

He currently lives with Judalyn and their son in Tanza, Cavite. \r\n\r\nAlbert makes it a point that people who have the same passion as he should have easy access to the Internet. Thus, every day he opens his shop for online users in his community, whose ages range from elementary students to middle class working professionals. His shop is located adjacent to his house so that he can manage it more efficiently.  Albert has been successful for four years now even without the aid of any employees. Monthly, he earns an estimated net income of Php 9,200.\r\n\r\nTo help him improve his business and continuously feed his passion, Albert solicits the help of CCT by applying for a loan worth Php 11,000. He intends to use this loan to purchase another computer for his shop. With this fund, he can also be equipped with ready money to purchase any necessary spare parts for his existing set of computers. According to him, this loan will definitely increase his profits and lead to the creation of an additional branch. \r\n\r\nCertainly there are times when trouble occurs, not just with his computers but also with his health. These are the struggles he currently faces. Nevertheless, Albert fights these struggles head on, knowing that his faith in the Lord and his undying passion will carry him through. It is his desire to have a healthy life and a strong family relationship. He also aims to have his own house as he strives to support his son all the way to college.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Nonetheless, at 27, Sapia still aims to make her business a success as it is the primary means for her to achieve a sustainable living. She attended college and presently resides near the public market in Tanza, Cavite. \r\n\r\nSapia\u2019s business centers on selling retail items such as bags, toys, watches, and other accessories. She sells these among friends, business acquaintances and fellow community members, who do not see it too imprudent to purchase items which might not be considered essential. Sapia locates her business in the community's public market and for four years she has managed to go without any employees. Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of Php 11,680.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, Sapia decides to ask for help from CCT by applying for a loan for Php 30,000. She wants to use this loan to purchase stocks of school bags and socks, as well as other items such as wallets and watches. Sapia sees the loan as crucial in supporting her working capital and bringing about an increase in her profits. She intends to use the profits to sustain her business and her living.\r\n\r\nThere are many dreams in Sapia\u2019s heart, that is why no matter how big the challenges are, they fail to distract her focus. She dreams of making her business grow and become sustainable, and she is grateful to those people who enable her to achieve it. As a CCT community partner, Sapia faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":778792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sapia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7600.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474140,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5066.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636921,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5066.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005231,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6333.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764408,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5066.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571542,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529129,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T13:02:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302692,"name":"Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reynaldo has been in the hog-raising business for 5 years.

her business. Mary Ann is a high school graduate and is married to Luis, a driver. Together they are raising four children, two of whom are still in school. Their family currently resides in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nOwning a piggery requires a lot of effort and Mary Ann recognizes this. Every day she has to make sure the piglets are given the right nutrition, stay in a good environment, and has the right suitable conditioning. She considers all these factors to make sure the piglets produce well. She also continuously seeks ways to improve the piggery. Mary Ann has been managing this business for 11 years, and makes a net income of around Php11,350 each month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue  the operations of her piggery, Mary Ann is requesting a loan for Php 27,000.  She will use this loan to purchase feeds for her piglets and materials to renovate her piggery. Included in the list of items to buy are hollow blocks, cement, and wood. She says that the profits will be used as additional investment in the future. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Mary Ann faces is when the pigs get sick.  She is also concerned about her children, as lately they have become disobedient when it comes to attending school. But Mary Ann is maximizing every resource she has at hand to make sure she arrives at the results she wanted. She dreams of becoming prosperous and raising her piggery to the next level. Of course, it is also her dream to see her children finish their education and have a career of their own someday, because the bottom line is that she cares and loves her children most. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":778803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy hog

Even as she makes her microbusiness grow, it is in her heart to extend the blessings to others. Feliza graduated from high school and now heads a family with Carlito, a mechanic. Feliza and Carlito raise eight children: one is in college, three are in high school, two study in elementary school and the other two stay home.\r\n<br>A vulcanizing shop is Feliza's business. She manages this hand in hand with Carlito, with no need yet for hiring employees. Everyday, they cater to clients in the vicinity with vehicles that need repairing. Feliza has been in this business for ten years and earns 10,600 PHP per month. She believes that her shop is going well but that it can be improved a lot more.\r\n<br>To capitalize on this opportunity to improve and level up, Feliza is seeking financial help by means of a 10,000 PHP loan. She intends to use this primarily to buy a machine needed for her vulcanizing shop. This added facility will definitely improve performance and, consequently, profits. The loan is a beacon of hope for her towards a growth in profits, and it serves as an encouragement to her to save more with the help of CCT. Feliza says that with the loan, she is more enabled to help others.\r\n<br>Feliza struggles with sickness at present, which hinders her from performing at her best and maximizing the opportunity to help others. Still, she believes in the Lord to strengthen her and bless her business as she remains faithful to her work with discipline and integrity. Feliza desires to lead a successful and peaceful life. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":778829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a new machine for her vulcanizing shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195136,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474143,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636924,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.29,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T22:36:15Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302722,"name":"Saad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRemedios operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  5-Philippines-pesos (Php) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Remedios earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also incorporates into her store a mineral-water refilling area while managing their rag-making business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also purchase additional raw materials needed for her rag-making business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her businesses. \r\n\r\nRemedios hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house renovated before the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":778833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for cases of beverages and mineral water for her variety store and for additional raw materials needed for her rag-making business.

matter what ups or downs might happen, life continues to flow. And Remedio, 50, learns to go with the flow while making sure he stays afloat. Remedio only reached high school. At present, he is a community partner in CCT* who actively attends Bible fellowships, trains on how to run a microenterprise, and saves for future business use. He is married to Jessielyn, and together they raise three children. They currently live in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n<br>Remedio has a rolling store \u2013 a store on wheels. He sells items that are of good use to customers on a daily basis, such as plastic wares and small appliances. For five years, Remedio has gotten to know what his fellow community members typically look for. With this business, he makes a net income of around 10,000 PHP per month. He manages to keep his business going without any employees at his side.\r\n<br>To help him continue to operate his business, he is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. He views this loan as a big boost to his capital, with which he is able to purchase necessary items to expand his product inventory. It is crucial for him to acquire whatever item his customers are looking for, and this loan enables him to do just that.\r\n<br>Life keeps on flowing, and while there is a positive look to it, it also brings challenges to Remedio. One of the uncertainties Remedio feels as he goes along with the flow every day is that he is not certain how they will survive each day, as there is still no concrete means of sustaining his business. One thing he holds to, however, is the business that he has. That is why he makes sure he meets every need of his customers so they will patronize his business and buy regularly from him. Even as he desires sustainability for his business, he prays for a good business space with a low rental rate. He longs deeply to see his children finish school and learn not just to go along with the flow but to make things happen.

She is married to Ramon, a butcher, and is mother of a child who is currently studying now. At this time, she is working hard to send her child up to college. College is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Zenaida, as she herself has been an elementary graduate. She believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nZenaida operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and meats cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP40, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nZenaida dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education, through all her hard work on her business. She also prays for good health always and to be able to establish more food stalls someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":778892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for

Norly, 54, being successful translates into being full. This is true for her both in her business, family life, and Christian ministry. Norly gives her fullest to achieve success in her business, even as she actively participates in the weekly Bible fellowships and entrepreneurial activities in CCT*. Norly remains single. She resides in Pasay City with the family she has grown up with.\r\n\r\nNorly manages a \u201csari-sari\u201d store into which she pours out her focus. She has this little space adjacent to their home where she displays her products, ranging from eggs to detergents to soft drinks\u2014anything her valued customers would need. She sells a lot in her community, being able to come up with PHP18,000 net income per month. Norly has managed to run the business alone for ten years now.\r\n\r\nIn order to give more and more of her potential towards improving her store, Norly has to outsource more finances to back up her funds. She then decided to loan PHP12, 000 with the help of CCT. With these new funds, she intends to purchase more goods for her store. This will include cases of soft drinks, boxes of canned goods, and sachets of detergents and fabric conditioners. It is important for Norly that her shelves are full of products, as these will attract more customers to her store and still retain the regular ones. Because of the loan, she is able to sustain her business and make sure that she does not run out of products to sell. The loan enables her to buy the things she needs to sustain her lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Norly faces, which is common to running sari-sari stores, is following up the debts of regular customers. Also, it is a struggle for her whenever she gets sick and weak, to run the store. But it is her goal to turn the store into a grocery. It is going to take her full effort to make it happen. \r\n\r\nNorly also desires to give her full commitment to the Christian ministry, where she belongs, and it has become of great help to her family.

After leaving the Koranic school that he attended until the secondary level, he began selling kola nuts and various products, a business that he learned from his father over 20 years ago and has been practicing on his own in the Koutiala market for ten years.  He is in high demand in the weekly markets of Koutiala and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nTo diversify his business, he decided to turn to the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  This is his first individual loan.  Mr. Mohamadou plans to buy four baskets of kola nuts with this loan.

She lives with her spouse and their children in the Koko neighborhood of the Koutiala prefecture (Sikasso region). \r\n\r\nFor social reasons, Fatoumata did not have the opportunity to study, so she became interested in business at a young age. After trying several businesses without success, she began selling firewood decades ago. Madame Fatoumata finds that this business makes a good revenue and is going very well, as she is able to sell a trailer-load each week.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her clients with more wood and increase the size of her business, she decided to seek assistance from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago. She is on her third individual loan, and the two preceding ones were duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she plans to buy two loads of firewood in the village of Koutiala. She sells daily in front of her home, for cash and credit to both men and women. She plans to make an average monthly profit of 100,000 CFA, which will be used to repay interest on the loan, help with the family's daily expenses, and invest in other income-generating activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":778946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a secondary education and has an animal-husbandry business. He has a small cow-house where he breeds calves. Because he does not have a specialized education, animal husbandry is the only source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nInomjon buys calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells on the same market at a more profitable price. He provides the markets with meat and his family with the necessary food. Inomjon wants to buy young cattle and needs money, so he decided to apply for a loan. He is very grateful to all those who can support him.   \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which being includes a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells jewelry and a variety of merchandise like cosmetics, perfumes and accessories that are on sale through specialty publications, or that have been ordered by her clients on credit or with cash. She started this 8 years ago, when a friend first introduced her to a specialized magazine that sells clothing and then later to another catalog that sells cosmetics. She works with these two sales options simultaneously and it's going very well. She was able to buy a display case, stock it and organize a commercial area in her own home where she exhibits the jewelry that she buys on credit in downtown Barranquilla, along with other products from the catalogs that she wants to show her customers. \r\n\r\nMargarita earns important income from this business that helps her to manage her household, which consists of her partner and their 3 children ages 4 to 23. She dreams of seeing them organized and successful in the future. Her long-term goal is to increase her business, improve the infrastructure with display cases and to diversify the merchandise she offers including fashionable and affordable handbags. \r\n\r\nThe Kiva loan is her first from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy merchandise that is on sale in her catalogs because she knows the tastes and needs of her customers and she will sell these products to them at good prices, meeting their requests. Her biggest challenge is selecting customers that buy on credit, because she has to be very careful with new customers so that she doesn't lose her capital.

especialmente pasteles, un amasijo de arroz, preparado con verduras, carne y\/o pollo\/y\/o cerdo,  envuelto en hojas de bijao, por eso  cuando junto a su madre lleg\u00f3  a la ciudad de Barranquilla, esto fue lo que se le ocurri\u00f3 hacer para generar ingresos y sostenerse:   puso en marcha su negocio de venta de los hoy conocidos pasteles y hayacas,  durante los fines de semana, aprovechando que las familias descansan de sus actividades dom\u00e9sticas y prefieren comprar ya preparada, la comida de todos en casa y en este caso consumir los deliciosos pasteles de Nelcy; negocio que result\u00f3 una buena opci\u00f3n, teniendo en cuenta que  para iniciarlo se necesitan pocos recursos y  se recupera  la inversi\u00f3n r\u00e1pidamente, cuando venden de contado, por eso despeg\u00f3  construyendo su propio mercado, al que poco a poco ha agregado  la venta diaria de fritos;  as\u00ed fue como  empezaron y hasta la presente les ha ido muy bien, porque al mercado de las amas de casa, adicionaron el mercado de las tiendas que les pide en mayor volumen,  pues congregan diariamente  gran parte de la comunidad, que consume al detal productos de la canasta familiar y es f\u00e1cil agregarle los pasteles y fritos, ya que estos productos forman parte de la dieta diaria que consume la comunidad donde habitan. En la actualidad Nelcy est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer financiamiento mediante la l\u00ednea credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas en mayor volumen como aceite, arroz e insumos, con esta inversi\u00f3n lograr\u00e1   descuentos y ahorrar\u00e1  en sus compras mediante el sistema de contado y en mayor volumen y esto le representa una disminuci\u00f3n en el costo de producci\u00f3n de sus productos.\n Para ella la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de alimentos, ha sido valiosa para fundamentar el ingreso personal y responder a los gastos del d\u00eda a d\u00eda familiar. Ahora su sue\u00f1o se enfoca en terminar de construir su casa, haciendo adecuaciones que le permitan tener un espacio puntual para su negocio; de esta manera desde que inicia el dia, trabaja enfocada en el crecimiento de su negocio y busca nuevos clientes que compren sus productos, con tal de aumentar sus ingresos y generar mayores utilidades para poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os.\n","en":"Nelcy, in her home department of Magdalena, learned to make traditional meals from her region when she was very young, especially 'pasteles' (a hotchpotch of rice, prepared with vegetables, meat and\/or chicken, and\/or pork, wrapped in banana leaves).  For this reason, when she arrived in the city of Barranquilla together with her mother, this was what she decided to do to make income and support herself.  She set up her business selling her now well-known 'pasteles' and 'hayacas' on a weekend, making the most of the fact that families would be taking a break from their housework and prefer to buy their family meals already prepared and, in this case, eat Nelcy's delicious 'pasteles'.\r\n\r\nNelcy's business turned out to be a good choice as she didn't need much money to start out and she quickly gained back what she had invested as she sells her meals for cash.  Her business took off and she built up her own market.  In addition, she also gradually started selling fried food every day.  This is how she started out and, up to now, things have gone very well.  She sells to housewives and also now to stores who request her food in larger volumes since each day they are visited by a large part of the community who buy staple food products and it is easy to add to that 'pasteles' and fried food since these products form part of the daily diet of the community where Nelcy lives.\r\n\r\nNelcy is currently applying for her first loan through Kiva which she will use to buy materials in larger volumes such as oil, rice and supplies.  With this loan, she will be able to obtain discounts and will save when she makes her purchases by shopping for cash and buying in larger volumes.  This will mean it will cost her less to make her products.  For Nelcy, the making and selling of food has been good for her personal income and also allowed her to respond to her day-to-day family expenses.

She lives in the popular \u201cSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\u201d neighborhood, a very well known place in Barranquilla because it was the site of the city\u2019s first airport and it\u2019s where all of the city\u2019s carnival culture comes together and is faithfully conserved.\r\n\r\nBeatriz Elena and her mother started the dressmaking business a year ago.  Once her mother stopped working as an employee at clothes making satellite firms she decided to give her entrepreneurial spirit free range by setting up her own business taking advantage of all her experience to generate family and independent income.  This was how she invested all her savings from her severance pay to set up this production spot in her own home with her daughter.\r\n\r\nSo, while Beatriz undertakes securing contracts, her mother works designing, preparing, assembling and finishing pieces that become outfits for women, men and children.  Her main customers are located in downtown Barranquilla at commercial spots and also in schools that Beatriz has managed to contact to offer them their services.\r\n\r\nBeatriz and her mother are interested in making their business grow so they\u2019ve called on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to get their first Kiva loan that they\u2019ll use to buy raw materials and supplies like fabric, buttons, zippers and thread, because they need to respond to orders from their customers and buying in bulk is more profitable because they save on the purchases with discounts that their suppliers offer.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to structure the business well and, above all, to have a properly structured house of her own where she can add a special space for her micro firm; this is precisely her great challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":779207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104697},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":114371},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116563},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118797},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":121074},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":123394},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":125760},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":128170},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130626},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133130},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135682},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.58,"local_amount":104697,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105089.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673779,"comment":null},{"amount":62.91,"local_amount":114371,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":114799.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320337,"comment":null},{"amount":129.45,"local_amount":235360,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":236242.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614540,"comment":null},{"amount":575.06,"local_amount":1045081,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1049000.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188247,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-01T02:47:02Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":302968,"name":"Vicentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cKANCHARY\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is married and has 6 children between 21 and 36 years old. The two youngest, who live with her, still go to school. Alda finished 6th grade in the old educational system and did not continue because of financial difficulties. She lives in her own house and supports a grandson and a nephew who live with her.\n\nShe left Inharrime to move to Maputo with her family when she was still a child. Now she has a farm of about 2 hectares where she has been growing vegetables with the help of one employee for more than 10 years. Through this work she earns about 3,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.\n\nAlda has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are customers of this institution. This is Alda's fourth loan with Hluvuku, and she is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy farm supplies (seeds, fertilizer, compost, and increase her area of production) to increase the amount she grows. The earlier loans for 8,500.00 meticais,10,000.00 meticais and 15,000.00 meticais were for agribusiness.\n\nShe promises to pay off her loan on time so she can have other loans in the future. Alda intends to ask for more loans both to increase her farmland and to try to start some construction work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":779247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

She started this activity 15 years ago when she was living in the city of Medell\u00edn with her husband and their two children, ages 26 and 29. After her husband died she came to the town of Malambo to her mother's home and eight years ago started a business offering recreational options to kids and youths through video games. Over many years Vilma's business did not have any competition and she was able to strengthen it some. A little while ago a neighbor started up a similar business, and Vilma needs to improve her service and modernize so she can compete. For this reason, she is turning to a Kiva loan to purchase a television, an Xbox, controllers and video games, and her goal in the future is to improve her storefront. She is requesting the loan to increase her working capital and generate alternatives for her customers to access modern and educational

This is Hilario's second loan with Hluvuku. He is asking for 22,000 meticais to buy construction material (zinc sheets, cement, sand, stone, etc.) to continue improving his house. The earlier loan was for 15,000 meticais and was for housing.\r\n\r\nHilario promises to make his payments on time so he can take out other loans in the future. He intends to ask for new loans so he can finish his house, furnish it and start his own

She is single and has an 11-year-old son who goes to school. Cristina finished 9th grade and quit school when she became pregnant. She did not go back because of financial problems. She lives in her own house and supports her mother and a sister, who both live with her.\r\n\r\nCristina has never left her hometown. She has her own business selling staple goods where she works from morning until day's end. She earns about 7,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses, and she even saves some money.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks, and she learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are also customers of this institution. This is Cristina's fifth loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy construction materials (cement, beams, zinc sheets, stone and other items) to continue building her house. The earlier loans were for 3,5000 meticais, 8,000 meticais, 11,000 meticais and 12,000 meticais and were for her business and for housing.\r\n\r\nShe promises to make her payments promptly so she can get more loans in the future.

She has been in this business for three years and considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to work all day long when she has very large orders.  However, Tania is a very responsible woman and she knows that any delay could damage her reputation.  She hopes that her business will become more well known and that it will therefore be able to grow more.  She is prepared to work very hard and without rest in order to achieve this.

Josefina is a member of the group.  She sells cosmetics through a catalog and also fried food in the mornings.  This is the third time that she has requested a loan.  The group was given its name because pearls make ladies beautiful and '5 de Mayo' is the name of the town where they live.\r\n\r\nJosefina is 63 years old and only attended elementary school.  She is married and has seven grown-up children: four sons and three daughters.  She tells us that she has been in business for twenty years.  She started out selling food from premises that she owns.  Then she worked as a butcher for 10 years.  She currently sells cosmetics through a catalog so that she can spend more time at home with her children and because her uncle is sick and there is nobody else who can take care of him.

Although he is still very young, Hilmer knows that it is time to earn his own money and get ahead in life.  For this reason, he decided to set up a grocery store where he could meet his neighbors' demands.  People come to his store as it is located in very busy area and, for this reason, his products sell out very quickly.  Hilmer has been in this business for two years and what he most enjoys about his work is chatting to his customers.

Gradually, as she grew her business, she had savings that she used to buy showcases and a shop location in a commercial center. This has worked out well as she is able to offer her customers more products. Each season provides the opportunity to offer merchandise pertaining to that season, such as products for Carnival, Christmas, New Years, Halloween, Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day. Father\u2019s Day is approaching and she is preparing merchandise for this season. This justifies her request for a loan from credikiva, which is her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use this loan to buy masculine type merchandise such as colognes, clothes and shoes in order to meet the demand for this family celebration. Maria would like to expand her business.
