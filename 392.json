She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used as additional capital for her business. Avelina is requesting a new loan of 10,500 PHP for her hog raising business. This loan will be her eighth from PMPC. \n\nAbout PMPC\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":536988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"As

She is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of the other group member if one is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nHelen is married and has 7 adult children. To make a living, she owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector planting crops. The main source of income for the business comes from the cassava and vegetables she plants and then sells in the local community. Helen has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Helen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Helen is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used for house repair. This will be Helen\u2019s 6th loan from PMPC.

is 28 years old and lives with his wife, parents and a small child. He is a man who, from an early age, was characterized as a hard-worker and very dedicated to his agricultural work raising the cattle. Bahriddin saw this as an activity that would enable him to have additional income due to the high demand for these animals in the markets. The challenge is to improve the breed but, in order to do so, he would have feed them properly. Bahriddin has the best intentions for his children, this ensures him to continue improving as a father and farmer. This farmer yearns to expand his business so that he will be able to improve his family's standard of living. In order to do so, Bahriddin is asking for a loan. This will allow him to buy animals of a better breed in order to improve their quality.  \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A farmer for 12 years, he has mastered farming techniques and always achieves good agricultural harvests, especially when the climatic conditions are favorable. The good yield, Ubaid realizes, is in general due to the seeds he uses. His current seeds have already been used for 3 years and are beginning to lose their productivity and need to be replaced by new ones. However, the lack of investment capital is his current problem. For this, Ubaid is asking for a loan of $3000 USD to buy selected seeds and fertilizers to revitalize his business. The improvement of his yield will give him the financial means to meet the needs of his family.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lutfullo is 39 years old. He is married and has four children. After he received a loan from IMON International, he witnessed an increased harvest for the first time in his life. With the loan, Lutfullo expanded his vegetable growing business. With the additional income from the harvest, Lutfullo opened a small kiosk, at his home, where his family sells different foodstuff items. Accordingly, his family\u2019s standard of living has improved. He is seeking a loan of $2200 USD to expand his farming operations, which will enable him to meet his targets for the coming season and, in turn, to generate additional income.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The married mother of three children lives in Kabul, Afghanistan and she wants to take a loan for her husband who has a retail shop.  When he first started this business, it was small and weak, but when he got an individual loan the business really improved.

is a professional salon-products distributor. She started her business in 2007 when she completed cosmetology school and was working with a small client base. Becoming a products distributor to professional salons allowed her the opportunity to increase her income and network with more experienced salon professionals. \r\n\r\nOne of Marsha\u2019s greatest successes in running her business has been to offer educational classes for cosmetologists. She says \u201cFor knowledge truly is power. By sharing knowledge, I not only help other professionals improve their businesses but improve mine as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of Marsha\u2019s biggest challenges has been to obtain the resources to increase her inventory in order to provide products on a larger scale. She realizes any business that cannot keep up with the demand for their product will ultimately lose the sale to another company. She explains \u201cHair stylists need products on a daily basis and I realize that if I didn't have the product, they would have no choice but to shop elsewhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarsha will be using this loan will to purchase additional inventory along with an inventory\/accounting software package.\r\n\r\nFor the future she is working towards developing a website for her retail products and an actual storefront away from her home. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities.

He is married and the father of a two-month-old infant.\r\n\r\nHe learned the business for several years working as an employee of more experienced shop owners. He currently manages his own shop. Mr. D. feels this is the only way he can earn a living and meet his personal needs. Running a business is also something he has inherited from his parents.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan for 500,000 francs to buy merchandise and build up his shop. The loan will enable him to buy certain products frequently requested by his customers, for which he lacks sufficient funds. He will therefore be able to significantly increase his turnover and his income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":531315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"boost working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djily","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790921,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971353,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708636,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922670,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189184,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484609,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620854,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758428,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-01T11:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495330,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923304,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T21:16:22Z","paid_date":"2011-03-25T09:26:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":196640,"name":"Eldaniz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eldaniz M. is a 38-year-old man who is engaged in a trade business.

Isabel works in dairy production, and Carlos works in drilling.\r\n\r\nIsabel had various problems in December of 2009; that is when her husband suffered a serious drilling accident that maD. them realize that the company and the job paid poorly. She had to sell her cows in order to help pay for her husband's operations as well as for her children's schooling. Carlos' parents did not want to help; she paid everything herself. Carlos was left without a job -he couldn't walk- and this year in February, he went through another operation for his spine, which went well because he has begun to walk and has started physical therapy in order to be able to work and help his wife and kids. Isabel is a woman who never left Carlos' siD.. In those moments when he was in bad shape, she never lost her faith or hope that Carlos would succeed and fight to become well.\r\n\r\nIsabel is asking for this loan to be able to buy a new head of cattle and so she can to produce more milk and make farm cheese to sell at the Quillacollo market. With this help she can earn more income until her husband is totally recovered and that they can work together so that their children can have careers and a better future and, above all, to teach them the value of life and to continue supporting their father so that he can return to work. Together they are a very united family, and they have dreams they hope to achieve in the future, such as the youngest son who wants to study medicine in order to help children of poor families in their neighborhood and to also help people who need it, like his father needed help after his accident. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva

years old and married to Leucadia. They have three children: two daughters, ages 12 and 4, and a son, age 8. They live in Kuluyo, a community in the Sacaba province of Cochabamba. He works in agriculture, and she in livestock. They are two who suffered a great deal when they were young, and they have moved ahead in a community far from the city.\r\n\r\nCiprian was raised alone by his godmother after his parents died when he was 8. His mother died when he was born, and his older brothers were not around, and he went by himself to an older person who he really respects, Francisca, and who is still around today and who serves as his mother. When he met his wife, Ciprian decided to go to Argentina to work so that his family wouldn't be lacking for anything, but when he was beaten and robbed and all his money that he had saved for the three years he was away from his family had been stolen, he gave thanks to God that he wasn't killed and returned to his country and went to work alongside his wife on the land that his father left him.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking this loan in order to buy seeds so he can plant potatoes and other produce that will increase his income and allow him to provide a better future for his family without having to leave the country and leave them alone. He is a very hard-working man; he leaves home very early to have a good harvest and other good results. He helps his wife with milking of the cows so she can make the fresh cheeses and sell them in the community. They dream of sending their children to study in the city schools since they are in a local school and don't receive a good education.

She lives in the community of London, in the Santiva\u00f1ez region of the Capinota province, located in the south of the Cochabamba. Lidia is single and lives with her senior citizen parents, Mr. Erasmo and Mrs. Florencia, ages 66 and 65.\r\n\r\nLidia and her parents work in the production of raw milk that they deliver to the unit in their region. They also have fields where they grow potatoes, carrots, and onions, an activity that generates a good income. Lidia and her parents are very dedicated to their work. Lidia is the youngest daughter of the couple. Erasmo is a very hard-working person, a retired teacher, and has instilled in his children the idea of responsibility and the desire for improvement, virtues that Lidia hold dear. She wants to study education, but she cannot leave her parents alone; also studying would mean she would have to travel an hour and a half from London to the university in the Cercado province of Cochabamba in order to realize this dream of hers and her parents.\r\n\r\nLidia is requesting a loan to be able to buy a head of cattle. This way she can increase their income, considering that the dairy farm only needs her attention in the mornings and at the end of the day. Then, her parents can care for the livestock and see that they are fed by themselves during the day, and Lidia can have the opportunity to begin her education with the help of her parents. Their dairy farm has seen them though their entire lives. Lidia was able to finish high school with the money earned from the farm. Now, Lidia needs more resources for her studies, and increasing the number in their herd will make more income available. When she is able to finish her studies, she can settle in Santiva\u00f1es, a town that has been forgotten and marginalized by the authorities for a long time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

V. is 28 years old, single, and lives in the Maica Central region of the Cercado province, in the department of Cochabamba. She has studied to be a pharmacist and works in the health center of Omereque, located in the southern region of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nLidia travels to Omereque every two weeks and goes to visit her mother in the region of La Maica, since she is the youngest daughter and the only one who accompanies her at home. She can already earn her own salary, although in Bolivia the salaries in the health sector are not very high. Furthermore, Lidia is only in charge of the health center's pharmacy, and she must pay rent since she doesn't own property in Omereque. Occasionally, when she has to make an emergency visit to her mother, she cannot afford to travel. However, this is the sacrifice she must make to fulfill her mother's dream of seeing her become a pharmacist. She has been working like this for almost two years, and her wish is to take her mother to Omereque so they can live there together. However, currently she does not earn enough income to support her mother, who has worked her whole life in a creamery but now finds herself worn out and older in age. Also, she suffers from rheumatism and will not be able to carry on this activity much longer.\r\n\r\nLidia has requested this loan to be able to start up a pharmaceutical business in Omereque. She has been able to see in this small town that the population needs a pharmacy that can attend to them during the hours when the health center is closed. Also, with this income she will be able to fulfill her desire to live together with her mother and also care for her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mark Broscoe, Kiva

They are responsible people who have always made their payments on time.   The bank's members are mainly single mothers and that is why they called the group \"Heridas de Amores\" (Hurt by Love), since they all went through bad times emotionally. The women's activities range from selling cosmetics and food, to selling flowers. They have the meetings at the president's house, at Balbina's, Mondays at 2:00 p.m. Balbina sells comforters and sheets and during the winter season she sells clothing on credit and collects weekly or bi-weekly. During the cold weather, she has a lot of orders. She is a very hardworking person and she always has a new product according to the season. She will use the money from the loan to purchase merchandise.   \r\n\r\nLuisa is new to the group. She sells flowers that she brings from the town of El Torno and delivers them to cemeteries in town. She has two older children, but she is raising two grandchildren because their parents work in the fields and she takes care of them every day. She will buy flowers in large quantities with the money from the loan since she has a lot of orders.       \r\n\r\nFabiola is a founding member who sells food from her house. Every evening she sells the food that she prepares in her home, as well as sodas and tradition drinks that she makes. All of the members are good role models who help with the economies of their homes. All of them are planning on investing the loan in purchasing merchandise for their businesses. They are very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust they have put in them with this loan.   \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

economic independence and stability.\r\nHer next goal is to have her own stand, with a lot of inventory of shoes.\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy shoes, particularly women\u2019s shoes, for the sales for Mother\u2019s Day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

Nayeli is his 8 year old daughter who he always goes to visit and for whom he works so hard. He has been working as a wall painter for some time now. He offers his services as an advertisement painter for both interior and exterior work. He works from his studio which is located two hours from home and therefore must wake up very early to arrive to work on time. In addition to this painting work, he also sells mattresses for additional income. Contracts are good and so are sales which is why he is very happy. In the future, he hopes to have a great place where he can engage in the sale of its latest product [mattresses], since he considers it more profitable. In the mean time, he wishes to continue working on selling his paintings as the earnings can cover his child's education to become a professional. This is his first loan with MFP and he agrees to be punctual with all payments. The requested loan will be used to purchase scaffolding which helps the exterior painting and part buy mattresses so he can start his new business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Kellogg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":531538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy painting supplies and buy mattresses to start his new business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-28T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":106.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144752010,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":213.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673235,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":106.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887061,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":106.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154076,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T14:36:20Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":196757,"name":"Ram\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ram\u00f3n C.

T. is 32 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business catching and selling ocean-caught fish .  Faava has 2 years of experience in this business.  Faava needs a loan of 1500 talas to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nFaava is a woman who had the initiative to develop her business and assist her family financially.  In 2009, Faava joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faava's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

One of her greatest virtues is standing out as a hard worker. She is always looking for an activity to get extra income for the family.  Gloria is asking for a loan from Integral. With it, she will be able to have the resources to increase the products for sale, as well as have fruits in season and more vegetables, which is what people request the most. <br

Maricel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maricel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Maricel from GDMPC.

He says, \u201cIn the beginning, I was manufacturing traditional Mongolian boots for family use and selling a few leftover boots to local residents. Since that time, the number of people who would like to buy our boots has increased and my business has expanded. Our service and product quality have improved over the past years.\u201d\r\n\r\nBatbaatar is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase leather and other necessary materials to manufacture traditional Mongolian boots. This is in anticipation of the upcoming spring, when demand for his products is very high. During the spring his customers' buying power increases because they sell large amounts of cashmere and earn a lot of money.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":531680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase leather and other necessary materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Zavhan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-04-27T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batbaatar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82661},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83700},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":83149},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83211},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83948}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.48,"local_amount":83425,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83756.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144795459,"comment":null},{"amount":59.87,"local_amount":82580,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":82908.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151975978,"comment":null},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":83363.25,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83694.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159713345,"comment":null},{"amount":60.49,"local_amount":83435.64,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83767.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166927463,"comment":null},{"amount":60.34,"local_amount":83232.41,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83563.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172194053,"comment":null},{"amount":423.41,"local_amount":583963.7,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":586286.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177489740,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-27T15:54:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:42:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":196830,"name":"Perlita's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perlita R. is from the village of Magcamiguing in Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this divorced mother of six, life has been about counting the few blessings that have shown forth in her daily life while trying to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out about Damalie is her resilience and unwavering hard-work attitude. Though she has been saddled with a myriad of operational cost challenges over the years, she has stood firm in the provision of welfare to her six orphaned children and three other dependents.\r\n\r\nDamalie started her business after the demise of her husband. Though she was destitute and in a dilemma, it was incumbent upon her to shoulder her dead husband\u2019s responsibilities because, as is the case in Africa, once a man dies, his children bear the brunt, especially if he was poor.\r\n\r\nDamalie\u2019s diligence was her only empowering recourse in such a wit\u2019s-end situation. She, with the help of friends, began her business selling secondhand clothes to extricate herself from such adversity. On the face of it, it was not the wrong decision.

F. is an older woman, 72 years old, and lives in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. She is jobless and stays at home to do housework. She is married but her husband died of senility years ago. She has a financial earner in her son who drives a motor taxi (Tuk Tuk), and who is now married and lives in the family home. \r\n\r\nThe family relies on the income from the taxi service. Unfortunately, the taxi broke down when picking up a passenger and their daily revenue has been affected.

Kabuo T. is president of the loan group, Twende Mbele, and it is her raising her hand on the photo. She is 37 years old, married and mother to five children, all at school. Her husband is a small businessman and has a pharmacy in Butembo, a commercial town which lies in the Lubero territory, more than 410 km from Goma. \r\n\r\nJ. Kabou T. sells second-hand shoes at the central market in Virunga. She began her small business with her own funds which she received from her husband after the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano on the 16th - 17th February 2002, which completely destroyed the economy and basic infrastructure of Goma. Her initial capital was just $50. She has been carrying out her second-hand shoe selling business for the past eight years.\r\n\r\nWith the loan from IMF Hekima, J. would like to increase her turnover by buying 100 pairs of second-hand shoes. The big challenge in this business is that the flow of goods (the purchase of shoes) depends on the circulation of money (people's income). Furthermore, the competition of shoes made in Uganda\/Kampala agitates the price.\r\n\r\nIn the future J. plans to strengthen her business, increase the level of her deposit account with IMF Hekima and finally to access a more significant loan in proportion to her savings.\r\n\r\nIn the coming ten years her ambition is to become a large wholesale businesswoman rather than a small retail businesswoman. She is planning on getting her supplies at source in the large commercial centre either in Kampala or in Butembo. Furthermore, J. Kabou T. rents her home and would like to buy a piece of land and build a house. Given that her husband works far away from her, this would allow her to reduce the burden of the family expenses. \r\n\r\nJ. is grateful to IMF Hekima for the loans which she receives without any material guarantee, since thanks to these loans, she will be able to provide for the needs of her children.\r\n\r\nThe Twende Mbele group is made up of 16 female members.    \r\n

Despite the difficulty in maintaining her business as she cannot re-invest her business income into it as it is also the main income source for her family's daily expenses, Anecia is hopeful that some day her dream will be ground on the palm of her hand. With that, she wants to request a much larger loan to support her business's needs and at the same time to sustain its operation. With her passion for giving her children a better future and a decent kind of life, she will be willing to work hard and to help her husband\u2019s sporadic income as a taho vendor.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, Anecia\u2019s dreams are always for her children and family. She wants to improve her children's quality of life. In 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have secured access to capital for the continuation of her taho vending business. Her previous loans were carefully utilized as additional and rolling capital for her business. \r\n\r\nAnecia is hopeful that her business will grow and that some day she will have more customers around the village. She also dreams of sending all her children to school until college and that they find good jobs. One of her aspirations is to be able to build a house that is durable and spacious.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":531898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To support

J. is president of the Tuungane loan group, and it is her raising her hand on the photo. She is a 48-year old widow and mother to five children, three of whom have their own homes and two who are students. Her husband passed away two years ago after a long illness. During all this time she has been the sole provider for her fatherless children. \r\n\r\nKavira sells smoked and fresh fish on a wholesale basis at the central market in Virunga. She began her small business with her own funds, a profit of $100 from a small commission. At that time she still lived in Vitshumbi, a fishing village situated alongside the west coast of Lake Verunga (known previously as Lake Edouard). She was delivery girl, intermediary and assistant to fish buyers coming from the town of Bukavi (south Kivu) and the fish farmers in Vitshumbi. She has been carrying out this fish selling business for the past 22 years. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from IMF Hekima, Kavira would like to increase her turnover by buying 200 or approximately two baskets of smoked fish and 400 or approximately three baskets of fresh fish. The main challenge of this activity is not to lose fish as a result of them rotting. For this reason she would like to buy a freezer. As far as her family is concerned, Kavira would like to send her fatherless children to school on a regular basis and see them get their diplomas so that they can do something useful for themselves and for society.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Kavira is planning to build a house with four bedrooms on her patch of land, which she will rent out in order to increase her income.\r\n\r\nKavira is grateful to IMF Hekima for her loans which she obtains without any material guarantee, since thanks to these loans she is able to provide for the needs of her children.\r\n\r\nThe Tuungane group is made up of 14 female members.\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

is a young married man who raises livestock to help his parents with their expenses and to save to build his own house in the future. This isn't an unpleasant occupation for him, actually it is quite the contrary. Dilshod carries out his duties with an enormous pleasure and with great affection towards the animals, taking care of them in the best way possible. Like every young person, he has dreams that he longs to see materialize. One of them is to add to his livestock herd so that, with time, he will be able to sell them in the market, especially on holidays. Dilshod is requesting a loan for this reason. He wishes to purchase cattle to add to his herd of animals and to increase his income by the year's end.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 35 years old and married with two school-aged children. He provides motorbike transport for a living and has employed two people.  He also grows cabbages for sale. Previously, he was selling clothes to earn a living. Joseph is a member of Woni Astol group in Faulu Kenya, whose aim is to guarantee each other's loans.\r\n\r\nJoseph joined this group so that he could easily access loans. The group members meet weekly and they save their money and share business ideas. Joseph has benefited from the group because he has been empowered to work hard in his business. He wants to buy a new motorbike so as to serve more customers, hence he requested a loan of Kes. 50,000 from Faulu Kenya. He hopes to buy a lorry in the future for transporting sand. He believes that the lorry transport business pays more than the motorbike business. Joseph describes himself as hardworking and

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group \"Soforaal\" (meaning \"to support one another\" in Diola, the local language) is a solidarity group of the \"Banc Villageois\" TAMBACOUMBA from the Casamance region in Senegal. The six women who are part of the group mainly work as seafood retailers, though most women in this region have multiple occupations. The group has existed since 2002, when the \"Banc Villageois\" was founded. So far, the members have received 16 loans each, all of which they repaid in time to Caurie Microfinance, one of Kiva's Fieldpartners in Senegal.\r\n\r\nD\u00e9d\u00e9 Kant\u00e9 is the leader of the group: she is 57 years old, widowed and responsible for four children (three boys and one girl). Market gardening is her main activity and most important source of revenues. Besides this, she sells fish as a second occupation to earn some extra money.
