Kiva loans are used to purchase chicks, food, and the medecine needed to keep the chickens healthy.  Once matured, the chickens are sold at small butcher shops or in the many open air markets throughout the valley.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

She is 50 years old and is a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Danilo, a retired electrician, and is mother to their 3 children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating their business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nClarita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Clarita earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Clarita is requesting a loan for Php 15,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and rice to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nClarita\u2019s dream is to be able to grow her business.

She is a widow and mother of two children. She manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to provide continuous income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlice operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Alice earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also sells cooked foods and viands at affordable cost.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and cooking ingredients to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlice's dream is to be able to grow her business.

This is the case of Rochelle, 32. Rochelle graduated from high school, but was not able to continue to college. At present, she is a single mom to one child, whom she loves and cares for dearly. They live in Pasay City with Rochelle\u2019s other family members. Rochelle is also active in her role as a community partner in CCT. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nRochelle has a store where she cooks meals for customers and sells varieties of daily essentials, from toiletries to instant food. The store is located adjacent to their house for efficient management on her side as she serves her fellow community members. Rochelle has stayed long in the business, and her family helps her in managing the store. She earns around 15, 000 PHP in terms of monthly net income.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, which is the primary source of her income, Rochelle applies for a 13,000 PHP loan. Purchasing necessary goods for her store is the main use of this loan. She plans to buy meat, fish, and vegetables to come up with delicious, healthy meals which her customers would surely love. She will also purchase stocks of seasonings, dairy products, and toiletries to meet the needs of her customers. Rochelle says that the loan helps her meet the daily needs of her family, as well as the finances needed for the education of her child.\r\n\r\nRochelle confesses that competition is her toughest challenge at present. There are a lot of stores having the same products that she has, and so she finds it hard to elicit loyalty among her customers. Sometimes the meals she cooked were not all sold, and she was forced to lower the price just to call it a day. But Rochelle never entertains the thought of defeat because her life\u2014and the life of her family\u2014hinges on the success of her business. This is where she will draw money for the medication of her child, the payment of the house bills, and much more. That is why her prayer is for her business to grow profitably and for her family to stay strong and united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":779609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marivic was a high school graduate. At present, she is a wife to Jose, a construction worker, and a loving mother to four children. Two of her children are already working, while two are studying in high school. Their family resides in Pasay City. Aside from her family and business, Marivic also spends time attending weekly Bible fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, Marivic sells frozen food from house to house in their community in Pasay. She sees this as an effective strategy since it also gives her a way to build relationships with her customers on a more intimate level. She has been doing this by herself for six years now, and earns a monthly net income of Php 9,000.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operation of her business, Marivic is requesting a loan for Php13,000 to help her increase her sales. She will use this to add more to her stocks of processed meat such as hotdogs and sweet ham, as well as pork and chicken meat. She admits that the loan will definitely boost her capital and will serve as a step toward business growth. According to her, part of the profits will be used to finance the schooling of her children, so the loan benefits not only the business but also her family.\r\n\r\nOne struggle Marivic faces is delayed payments by her customers. Some do not pay in full and leave part of it to debt. Marivic frequently worries about the education of her children, but she fights these struggles and makes sure at the end of the day that she is happy inside out, because a happy family starts with her, the light of their home.  She desires to see her business grow and presently looks for other sources of income.

She is a college graduate and a mother of one child in school. At this time, she is working hard to provide continuous income for their everyday expenses and be able to send her child all the way through college.  This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Maricel, as she herself has finished college and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMaricel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Maricel earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and lot in a prominent subdivision in a nice location. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It should be said that the business group Farijika consists primarily of women.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":779758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy four baskets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T05:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batasema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katungu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahindo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Furaha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mapendo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortense","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabintu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Furaha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zawadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sheria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Njimbi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wabiwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dusabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216529120,"comment":null},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221696619,"comment":null},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227066221,"comment":null},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232826889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-30T11:26:35Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":303249,"name":"Mansavo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"MANSAVO est un groupe de trois personnes, dont les membres habitent tous ensemble dans le m\u00eame quartier.

He has been running a mobile phone sales business for 5 years, working from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. Masali is able to make a small monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Masali's 2nd motisha loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. A motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to repay their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended. Masali used the previous loan to increase his phone stock and has repaid it successfully.  He hopes for a loan to buy more mobile phones and phone accessories to sell. His dream is to one day own a big shop where he will have a big stock of phones.\r\n\r\nMasali will share this loan with his group \"Green\", consisting of 7 members, who will hold each other accountable in repaying their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":785256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To  buy more mobile phones and phone accessories  to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2011-06-03T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Masuli","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ashura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwumvita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chacha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kubebwa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":2580000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":161250},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":161250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":523.44,"local_amount":806250,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":809234.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216584513,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":645000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":647387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221753461,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":645000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-22T08:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":647387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227980651,"comment":null},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":161250,"processed_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":161846.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232884102,"comment":null},{"amount":104.68,"local_amount":161250,"processed_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":161846.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232884103,"comment":null},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":161250,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":161846.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232884104,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T19:34:22Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:16:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":303349,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret sells greens.

actividad y aunque nunca pens\u00f3 vivir de ella, decidi\u00f3 acudir a esta experiencia cuando su c\u00f3nyuge qued\u00f3 sin empleo y necesitaban generar ingresos para los gastos del hogar, en el cual existen 3 hijos en las edades de 9, 20 y 15 a\u00f1os. As\u00ed que ahora Niza trabaja en su propio negocio de vender ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos, colonias y  toda mercanc\u00eda que encarguen sus clientes. Ella vende a cr\u00e9dito  a amas de casa, trabajadores independientes, empleados que permanentemente le refieren nuevos y buenos clientes; su mayor desaf\u00edo es hacer que le alcance su capital de trabajo para poder responder oportunamente a sus clientes y esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual  se acerc\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito; el credikiva es el primer financiamiento y lo aprovechar\u00e1 para responderle a sus clientes, que han solicitado ropa, calzado, colonias ye general mercanc\u00eda masculina, pues se acerca el d\u00eda del padre y cada familia quiere halagar a su progenitor haci\u00e9ndole un regalo.

She decided to call on it when her spouse lost his job and they needed to generate income to cover household expenses where there were three children whose ages were 9, 20 and 15.  \r\n\r\nSo now, Niza works in her own business selling clothes, cosmetics, colognes and all sorts of merchandise that her customers order from her.  She sells on credit to housewives, independent workers and employees who permanently refer new and good clients to her.  Her greatest challenge is stretching her capital  to be able to respond in an opportune way to her customers.

She finished high school and is married and has three children who attend the community elementary school.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that a little more than seven years ago, she began to sell shoes and cosmetics from a catalog, which she sold going house to house with her friends and neighbors. She first shows her catalogs, takes an order, sends it to her suppliers and when the package arrives, she takes it to her customers and receives payment for her products.\r\n\r\nAlicia, in addition to selling shoes and cosmetics, sells, from Monday to Friday, Mexican snacks (empanadas, tostadas, tacos, gorditas) and sweets at the elementary school in her community at the time when the children come out to play.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to invest it in the purchase of catalogs, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics, tomatoes, chiles, onions, meat, oil, salt, cream, cheese, and soda so she can prepare her sales and later sell her Mexican snacks.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with this investment, her business prospers since she wishes to give a better quality of life to her children and that, in the future, they study a profession so that they can get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members of the group are called: Margarita -

He has been in the business for approximately ten years and he says that it is doing well as it has enabled him to get his small family ahead in life.  He requested this loan to further grow his business.\n\nFalemon started working in this business because his father was in the same business when Falemon was young and when he got married he decided to do the same work as his father.  However, first he went off to work somewhere else so that he could put together some savings with which to start his business.\n\nFalemon's biggest wish is that, with this loan and his business, he

She is a very kind and sincere woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 34 year-old Mario, and her four beloved children who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAleyda's work is buying and selling fish.  She does not sell from a fixed sales location but rather delivers her products to her customers who buy from her at very reasonable prices.  Aleyda works hard to ensure the fish she sells is as fresh as possible.  She goes to the fish market very early to buy her fresh fish.  She considers herself to be a very cheerful saleswoman who is very helpful to her customers.  This has given her an advantage in her sales business.  She has been in this business for 14 years but the smell still bothers her as it pervades everything.  However, she knows that it is part of this work.  In the future, Aleyda would like to own a refrigerator where she can store and sell fish without having to worry about it going off in the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThis will be Aleyda's twelfth loan from MFP and she hopes to make all her repayments on time.  She is a very well-liked member of her community bank because of the cheerfulness that she brings to the group.

She is a very kind and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 56 year-old Jos\u00e9, and her beloved daughter, 18 year-old Cristel, who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nTesalia's business activity is hiring out motorcycle taxis.  Every day, from very early in the morning, young drivers who would like to earn a little money during the day turn up to hire one of her motorcycle taxis.  In addition to this business, Tesalia also transports regional products by motorboat.  That business is making her very good income.  What Tesalia most enjoys about her work is helping people to make an income by managing the motorcycles that she owns.

She lives in her own home alongside her husband, Julio, 27, and their dear son Smith who is 5, to whom they wish to provide a better future. The business that Maria is dedicated to is selling shoes, which she does in the street. She walks the streets of the city of Pucallpa in search of customers who wish to buy. She acquires the shoes from a catalog and places orders to her wholesale distributor. Is is for this that the models that she sells are very new and known. What she likes most about her work is to sell and to feel very happy when she sells all of her merchandise. She has been doing this work for eight years and finds transporting the shoes the most difficult part since the boxes that she brings are very heavy and tire her a lot. She hopes to have, in time, a shoe shop where she can sell with greater comfort to her customers. This will be her eighth loan with MFP and she hopes to be able to pay all of her payments on time, the same as she did with her first payments. In her community bank, she is a cherished member since she is always concerned with the wellbeing of the rest of the members. With the 1,400 new \"soles\" requested, she will buy more shoes in order to provide her customers with greater variety from which to choose."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":780028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-05T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":213.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":218.31},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":228.65},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":237.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":246.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":255.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.74},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.49},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.98,"local_amount":213.29,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":219.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550415,"comment":null},{"amount":81.87,"local_amount":218.31,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":224.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719091,"comment":null},{"amount":363.15,"local_amount":968.4,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":997.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350555,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-08T07:31:41Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":303421,"name":"Gherzon Rodney","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Gherzon  es un cliente joven recomendado por una cliente antigua y responsable, el se dedica a brindar servicio t\u00e9cnico en sistemas y a arreglar computadoras, a pesar de su juventud demuestra responsabilidad en su trabajo, el comenz\u00f3 a trabajar desde sus 10 a\u00f1os en este rubro logrando con la pr\u00e1ctica gran experiencia y conocimiento, vive en la zona de villa nueva potos\u00ed junto a su mama, siendo totalmente independiente, tambi\u00e9n percibe un sueldo fijo porque trabaja por las ma\u00f1anas y por las tardes en una tienda.

This school is staffed with 30 employees and has an enrollment of 1,500 pupils. \r\n\r\nThese hard working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 5,600,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful projects that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials or a piece of land, or to pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nMary is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in Makeni city, today Mary is living in Waterloo together with her husband and child. Mary has served in the teaching profession for many years now.

Ella compra su mercader\u00eda, espec\u00edficamente dos fardos de ropa, cada tres meses en la ciudad de Santiago.\nErika en los pr\u00f3ximos meses comenzar\u00e1 otro negocio y ser\u00e1 la venta de confites, bebidas y s\u00e1ndwich, para ello est\u00e1 esperando que le entreguen un kiosco que ubicar\u00e1 afuera de un colegio, por lo que invertir\u00e1 el dinero del cr\u00e9dito en mercader\u00eda para abastecer su nuevo negocio.

Le gusta mucho participar de las reuniones, ya que aprende con las capacitaciones, adem\u00e1s ha podido integrar estos conocimientos a su negocio, por lo que ahora distribuye sus gastos y se encuentra m\u00e1s organizado.\nTalca pertenece a la regi\u00f3n del Maule, ubicada en la zona centro del pa\u00eds. Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cDespertar\u201d (To Awaken) and is composed of 18 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of businesses such as: underwear sales, honey and vegetable sales, marmalade making and selling, drape and curtain making, metallic structure manufacturing.  All are from the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nErika, who in the photo appears seated in the first row on the first spot from left to right and is wearing a white jacket with a lilac kerchief around her neck, sells used clothes at home all day and on weekends at a farmers market.  Her customers are recurring so she knows them and gives them easy payment terms.  She buys her merchandise, specifically bundles of clothes, every three months in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nIn the next few months, Erika will start a new business selling snacks, beverages and sandwiches.  To do so, she\u2019s awaiting delivery of a sales kiosk that she\u2019ll set up outside a school.  She will, therefore, invest the loan money in merchandise to stock her new business.  If it doesn\u2019t work out for her though, she\u2019ll buy more bundles of clothes to stock her original business.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to finally be able to make the new business a reality and to provide work for her daughter-in-law while Erika will be able to split her time among both businesses.  Besides, she\u2019d like her clothing sales business to expand and to build a shed in her yard to set it up as a clothing store with dressing rooms and display cases included.\r\n\r\nErika lives with her husband, her 18-year-old daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter.  Her dream on a personal level is to have an independent business that will allow her to have a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza.  She likes taking part in the meetings very much because she learns from the trainers.  Besides, she\u2019s managed to apply what she\u2019s learned to her business; she now spreads out her expenses and is more organized.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in the center of our country.  It is the region\u2019s administrative, economic and cultural center being the most important city in Chile\u2019s Central Valley.  There is a curious reference to Talca in Chile, the phrase: \u201cTalca, Paris and London.\u201d  Among the myths relating to it, some say it derives from what an Englishman once said: \u201cTalca parece Londres,\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in winter like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":780050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

Elena\u2019s snack stand is located in one of the most popular parks in the city of Pucallpa.  Her day normally begins at 8am and ends after 6pm, but she takes advantage of slower times of business to see her daughter who is still very young and requires a great deal of attention.  What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to do other things while she tends to her snack stand.  She has been in this business for two years and considers the most difficult part to be having to stay in the sun all day.  She hopes that over time, she can set up a store where she can better serve her customers.

He has been operating his business for 13 years as a licensed, professional welder.  Roland lives in San Antonio, but travels all over the state of Texas working as a sub-contractor for commercial projects.  For example, Roland has done steel and welding work for state-funded projects in Austin and Belton, Texas, and also helped build an elementary school in Kingsville, Texas.  Roland currently has four employees, though this number fluctuates depending on his workload.  \r\n\r\nThis loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana is helping Roland buy a gasoline-powered welding machine, as well as providing him with operating capital to run his business.  As a sub-contractor, Roland must wait for the general contractor to be paid before he receives compensation.  Having operating capital helps Roland compete for jobs he otherwise couldn\u2019t by giving him the means to front project expenses.  Roland also views this loan as an opportunity for him to build his business\u2019 credit, which will help facilitate further expansion in the future.\r\n\r\nFamily is a big part of Roland\u2019s life. He routinely travels to Odessa to visit his daughter and spend time with his two infant grandsons.  To make the trip financially profitable, he and his daughter try to line up work for him during his visits, so that he can stay with them for days at a time.  He has volunteered with the Boy Scouts for years, and is currently helping his 16-year-old son qualify as an Eagle Scout.  His youngest daughter, who is 11, wants to be a marine biologist. Roland calls himself his kids\u2019 biggest fan and works hard to support their dreams.  \r\n\r\nRoland has relied on word-of-mouth advertising and referrals to generate business.  He recently started attending Hispanic Contractors Association meetings to network with professionals in the construction industry and get advice on how to better market his business.  His long-term goal for Accurate Metalworks is to build it into year-round business, and eliminate the downtime he experiences during the winter.  Because there are fewer projects going on during the winter, it can be difficult to find work.  He believes that he can achieve this by building stronger relations within the industry and making his company better

Gabriel, who has over seven years of experience in the pest control industry, launched his business in early May, 2011 after months of planning and preparation.  The grand opening of his business is timely, as it marks the beginning of the summer season, the busiest time of the year for the pest control industry.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Mexico, Gabriel came to the United States 14 years ago.  Before working in pest control, he worked for several years as a salesman in the music industry.  This experience took him all over the state of Texas and Northern Mexico.  From his accumulated experience, Gabriel half-jokingly says that if there is one thing he has learned about Americans, it is that they love good customer service.   Knowing this, he sees excellent customer service as being as much a part of his business as the expertise he provides.  He says that it is crucial to build and maintain customer relationships, because satisfied customers are the cheapest form of advertising.  As he points out, someone can look up pest control companies in the phonebook, but they are most likely to work with a company recommended to them by a friend.\r\n\r\nAs a native Spanish speaker, Gabriel says that being bilingual is helping him find a niche for his business within the Hispanic community.  \u201cThere is a lot of competition in this industry, but Hispanics are looking for someone they can speak Spanish with, and I think that helps me.  I\u2019m not the only one (who speaks Spanish), but I\u2019m one of the only ones with his own company.\u201d  Though he wants to continue building relationships within the Hispanic community, he also wants to connect his business with the greater community.  One way he is doing this is by going through neighborhoods, meeting people, and making them aware of the services he offers.\r\n\r\nThis loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana helps Gabriel pay the necessary fees for registering his business. He says that the government has strict requirements for pest control, and that navigating through the paperwork can be as expensive as it is time-consuming.  It is important that he be officially registered and certified so that he can offer all of his expertise.  For example, he has yet to receive approval to treat termites, leaving him unable to provide one of the key services his business offers.  \r\n\r\nAside from helping Gabriel receive all of the necessary certifications, this loan is helping him purchase business cards and launch a small marketing campaign.  He wants to advertise his business in local newspapers and magazines.  Gabriel has already undertaken a less expensive form of advertising by walking through neighborhoods and handing out business fliers.  Before receiving this loan, Gabriel financed his startup costs with his personal savings and credit
