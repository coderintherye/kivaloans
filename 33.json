He is considered an excellent carpenter, and not only in his own town. Every day he gets more than 20 orders from nearby villages and outlying regions. <P>Increasing prices in Azerbaijan have affected the wood sector also. The number of wood-working studios is increasing and the price for wood is increasing also. In summer it is easier to get wood than in winter. Summertime is also high season for orders from his customers. <P>The tools Hamil uses for his work are old, so he has applied for a loan of $1200 to purchase new, modern planing tools to make his work easier.

With these loans, he was able to buy food and pay school fees for his children.<p>Given a loan of $500, he plans to sell palm oil and firewood which is the main source of energy in his locality and to use the money raised to expand his business and provide for his family.<p>He plans to pay off the loan in 18 months and the first installment of repayment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":54199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase firewood, palm oil,","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

She will buy palm oil from the villages where they are cheaper and sell in the town so she can make a maximum profit. She will use this profit to pay school fees for her children and to buy food for her family.\r\n\r\n<p>She plans to pay her loan in 24 months. Her first loan repayment installment shall be made on the fourth month from the date of disbursement of the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":54232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

is married to Maracas Ngang and their union is blessed with four children.

Since then, she has been able to invest and repay all her loans with which she raised money to buy good food for her household, pay school fees, buy medications and increase her business.\r\n\r\n<p>Given a loan of $1200, she plans to do motorbike transport business. This is a lucrative business in this area as many now transport themselves on motorbikes since it is faster. The motorbike will be ridden by a trained and experienced driver. With this, she will raise money to pay her children\u2019s school fees and buy medications for herself and her children. She plans to pay her loan in 24 months.

Her source of happiness has always been seeing her children educated or learning a trade.  However, this dream was shattered because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough to pay for the associated costs. This motivated her to seek help and become a member of GHAPE.  She was trained in business management, marketing techniques and credit discipline. Since then, she has taken out and repaid loans which have allowed her to assist her husband in paying for school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan of $700, Regina plans to fatten and sell pigs as well as cultivate vegetables to raise money for school fees and to improve her business. Given the fact that pig fattening takes some time, the sale of her vegetables will enable her to start repaying the loan when the time comes.\r\n\r\nShe plans to repay her loan in 24 months. Her first repayment will be made four months after the date of disbursement of the

All of his children are currently in school. He has spent a lot of money on medication in an attempt to cure his child of an illness that made him mute. In addition to this, he was unable to provide three square meals for his family and pay his children's school fees. This motivated him to become a member of GHAPE where he was trained in business management, marketing techniques and credit discipline. Since then, he has taken out and repaid loans which enabled him to earn money to pay for school fees and buy food for his family.\r\n<p>\r\nGiven a loan of $1200, he plans to sell groceries in the residential areas.  This will reduce the need for people to travel to the main market for groceries. He plans to earn money to feed his family and to pay for school fees. He also wants to use the money to get medical help for his sick child.\r\n<p>\r\nHe plans to repay his loan in 24 months.

He greatly enjoys his family life thanks to the training he got from GHAPE.  Before this training, he suffered from marital misunderstanding due to ignorance and was also unable to provide for his family.  This motivated him to become a member of GHAPE where he was trained in business management, marketing techniques and credit discipline. Since then, he has taken out and repaid loans which have enabled him to pay for school fees for his children and buy food for his family.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan of $800, he plans to fatten and sell pigs, which are a commonly consumed meat in this area.  While waiting for his pigs to be fattened, he plans to cultivate short cycle crops to sell so that he can start repaying his loan.\r\n\r\nHe plans to repay his loan in 24 months.  His first loan repayment installment will be made four months from the date of disbursement of the

On Saturday afternoons she teaches hairstyling at a beauty school in the city of El Alto.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This loan is to be used to finance her son's thesis coursework at Salesiana University.  This is the first time she has requested a loan through IMPRO, and IMPRO's financial analysis indicates that she has sufficient income to repay this loan and cover her and her dependent child's living expenses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Rosario McFaull, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>La Se\u00f1ora Miriam A. vive en casa propia ubicada en la zona de Llojeta Bajo en la calle Valle Vergelito N\u00ba 1146 de la ciudad de La Paz.

With these loans, he increased his business. His children were able to go to school and some learnt a trade.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given a loan of $1200 and the training gotten from GHAPE, he plans to rear pigs, cultivate crops and sell food items and raise money to continue paying school fees for his children and provide them with food and medications.

O., 50 is a married mother of 7 daughters. She has been raising cattle for 9 years. Musharaf\u2019s husband works as a driver and her two daughters work at a confectionery. Musharaf began her cattle business since she moved to <i>dacha.*<\/i> Then, she had a cow and a calf. In 2005, when Musharaf joined MicroInvest, she received $150 loan. Gradually, she expanded the size of her farm and increased the number of cattle. Musharaf improved quality of life for her family. She increased her business assets to $1000 on which she receives $600 income. In the future, Musharaf plans to increase the variety and headcount of her livestock.\r\n<p>*TRANSLATOR\u2019S NOTE. The meaning of the word <i>dacha,<\/i>as it used here, is different from that commonly found in an English dictionary. Since the late 80s, it became increasingly popular in the former USSR republics for the local government to sell or distribute small parcels of lend to people (oftentimes as small as 20 x 20 meters) for building <i>dachas<\/i> or summer houses. Since collapse of the USSR, many dacha owners turned them into tiny farms to feed their families.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva

is 52 years old.  He is married and has three young children. Nosirboy buys and sells agricultural produce.  From early morning until lunch, he visits markets in the neighboring villages and sells potatoes, onions and carrots.  He purchases produce at wholesale markets on the border with Uzbekistan and then sells it in villages.  His wife stays at home looking after their children and helps him in the market. The turnover of Nosirboy\u2019s business is not very big, but it allows him to provide for his family.

Given the level of demand from his customer base, which continues to grow, he hopes to weave relationships with laboratories and thus to resupply his shop with medicines.

Having understood very quickly that work makes the man, he gathered his courage and put it into working hard at ploughing. Today Mr. A. wants to take advantage of this opportunity and is asking for a loan of $1,000 to buy fertilizer in order to improve the quality of his soil.

has a small phone center in the village Kuchkak, in the Kanibadam region.  His center provides services for the main providers of mobile phone communications in Tajikistan as well as a place for people to settle their accounts.  He also provides long-distant phone service.  For a reasonable price, villagers can call their relatives in any part of the world.  \r\n<p>Abror is 33 years old, he is married and has three children.  The idea about opening a service center came to Abror because of the growing numbers of cellular telephone providers that increased the demand for services. To expand his business would mean financial investment and Abror applied and received his first loan from \u201cMicroInvest\u201d.  He purchased phone cards for express phone payment and SIM cards for mobile phones. Currently Abror is planning to receive another loan for further expansion of his business. \r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva Volunteers.

Halima sold material bags that she sewed herself and plastic bags while holding them in her hands. <p>\r\nHalima has been a client of MicroInvest since 2002 when she borrowed $50. After receiving this loan, she purchased a permanent selling spot and increased her sales by $600. In the future, she wants to expand her business to wholesale and to acquire a better selling location. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

In the future, she hopes to increase her sales and purchase a personal meat grinder. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian to English by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer<p><b>\r\n\u0418\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u2013 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0443\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0420\u0424, \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435.  \u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 6 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430. <p>\r\n\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u041c\u0417\u0424 \u00ab\u041c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u00bb \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 2004\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0438 \u0435\u0451 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0438 70$. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c  \u043e\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e,  \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0451 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043e 300$.  \u0412 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438  \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0443."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":55135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Increase her sales and purchase a meat grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-08-26T07:05:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-09T16:18:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2007-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:22:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58948,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:23:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72265,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T10:22:56Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86990,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":68,"local_amount":68,"processed_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103060,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-26T16:18:15Z","paid_date":"2007-12-26T10:18:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":16543,"name":"Marhabo","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Marhabo B. is 49 years old.

K. is 37 years old, married and has one child. He lives in the town of Athi River in the outskirts of Nairobi. Daniel has been a photographer for five years. His decision to be a photographer was influenced by the remoteness of his community and the uniqueness of the business. <p> Daniel started taking photos using a small camera and would walk from place to place looking for clients. He would also target major events such as weddings, and it is from these small beginnings that he saved about Ksh 25,000 (USD 400) to open up his own studio in February 2006. With the savings, he was able to pay rent for a small room, and he also bought some of the basic requirements in a studio, including linen for providing background for the photos, picture frames and a bigger camera. <p> The quality of Daniel\u2019s photos is outstanding and this is attested to by his increasing number of clients. Daniel now seeks to expand his business by purchasing more items to enhance his service, since he is receiving more clients day by day. Daniel has noted that since his operational capital is limited, he is forced to frequently travel to  Nairobi to buy additional stock of the various items he needs to use often, as he is only able to buy these in small quantities. <p> Daniel is therefore requesting a loan of $750, which will be repaid over a 12-month period. This will enable him to purchase some of the items that he uses frequently. Some of the items he intends to buy include bigger picture frames, film, an extra camera and linens. The new additions will enable him to give much better service to his clients, since he will not waste so much time in traveling to the city. This will help to increase his income, firstly because he will be better able to meet the needs of his customers, and secondly, because the bulk purchases will help him by saving on the amount of money he uses to travel to the city to buy additional

She lives in Mlolongo, a small town located along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. <p> Janet was previously employed at Sana Industries in Nairobi\u2019s industrial area. While still under employment, she did a part-time business making shower caps and petticoats at home, and selling these to her fellow employees. During this time, Janet was saving money, and so in 1999 she left her employment and rented a stall in Mlolongo town to start her own business. She chose Mlolongo town because her brothers lived there, and she had also conducted her own research and found that there were few tailors, yet the population was still growing. For this reason, she also decided to settle there, a decision she has not regretted to date. <p> Janet\u2019s initial capital was Ksh 20,000 (USD 300), which she had saved from her previous employment, which she used to buy a sewing machine and an assortment of fabrics. Together with her husband, who is also a tailor, Janet continues to make clothes for her ever-increasing number of customers.

Francisca entered this male dominated business after closing her salon business due to a directive from the Government of Kenya in 2005 to demolish buildings that had been built along the Nairobi Mombasa Highway. These demolitions greatly affected the many businesses that had flourished along the road. This directive also personally affected her very much, since she had invested a lot of money into her salon business, but she did not give up. Armed with Ksh 50,000 (USD 755), which she had as savings, Francisca decided to move into another business, and she started buying cement, timber and iron sheets. With part of her savings, she also was able to rent a yard where she is operating to date. <p> Francisca also has several plots of land that she had purchased earlier, but she had not yet developed them. As her business picked up, she decided to begin constructing residential rooms for rent on these plots. However, one thing that has been hindering her efforts is the lack of enough construction materials to enable her to complete her construction project. On the other hand, due to the increasing population in this growing town, the demand for rental houses continues to go up, and people like Francisca are finding it hard to meet the demand. For this reason, Francisca is kindly asking for loan of $850 so as to purchase construction materials like cement, iron sheets and building blocks, to enable her to complete the houses that she has started constructing. <p> With this kind of assistance, Francisca will be happy that she will have helped someone get a place to call home.

Senora Julia lives with her husband and children in their own house on Francisco Suarez Street, in the city of La Paz.  She was given a loan previously  to help with her business selling clothing.  Unfortunately, that business was not very good because she bought the merchandise on credit, and her clients didn't always pay on time and she had to work very hard to recover the money.  For that reason, Julia decided to open a kind of pension with her son.  Their pension is a restaurant which serves a regular lunch and dinner, and the customers pay once a month for their daily meals.   This business is going very well.   She is requesting this loan to buy more supplies of rice, flour, noodles, etc, in greater quantity, as well as a refrigerator to keep the perishable items fresh. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia has been a client of Impro, since 2005, and her previous history shows that she will comply with the terms of the new loan without any problem. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Julia vive con su esposo e hijos en casa propia en la calle francisco Su\u00e1rez de la zona de bajo Tacagua de la Ciudad de La Paz. Anteriormente se le dio un cr\u00e9dito para aumento de capital ya que la se\u00f1ora vend\u00eda ropa; en este  negocio no le fue muy bien porque daba la mercader\u00eda a cr\u00e9dito y los clientes no le pagaban puntualmente y tenia que pasar mucho trabajo para recuperar el total del dinero. Por esta raz\u00f3n Julia  decidi\u00f3 abrir una pensi\u00f3n (es decir un restaurant donde sirve almuerzo y cena, y los clientes pagan una vez al mes por su almuerzo y cena diarios) con su hijo; el negocio esta funcionando  bien, sin problemas.\r\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para comprar insumos como ser arroz, fideo, s\u00e9mola, etc, en cantidad y tambi\u00e9n para comprar una conservadora (refrigerador) para los productos perecederos, como la carne, se mantengan frescos y en buen estado.\r\n\r\nEs cliente antigua de Impro desde el a\u00f1o 2005 y su antecedente historico indica que

Carabane is a very isolated village that is difficult to access, which makes it very difficult for its inhabitants to get credit.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

The Bayamba group is from the village of Colufifa in the southern Casamance region of Senegal, until recently the scene of a devastating separatist conflict.  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The women of Casamance are brave and hardworking, especially when it comes to trade.  However they lack the chance to put these attributes to good use, because they are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation.  In fact, in many cases the wife is the most important member of the household, thanks to her role in producing food for the family and countless other responsibilities.<p>\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenue for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.<p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can engage in the trade of products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.  This will allow the women to make a profit and repay the loan.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

However, the majority of young girls and women do not have any source of income, and this is the cause of the exponential growth in migration away from rural areas.<p>\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenue for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.<p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can trade products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.  This will allow the women to make a profit and repay the loan.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b> \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : Contexte :\r\nLa Casamance est une r\u00e9gion tr\u00e8s enclav\u00e9e du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and has restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":55276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of five cows, feed and veterinary supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mlomp","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.828889 -16.5275","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-08-21T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-05T01:07:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79984,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:29:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93732,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173870,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201088,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228292,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-07-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-08-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286173,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316404,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-22T01:07:38Z","paid_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":16611,"name":"Rano","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Rano is 37 years old.
