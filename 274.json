Con el dinero que ahora solicita comprar\u00e1 sillas y mesas, as\u00ed como gran cantidad de bebidas para seguir activa en este negocio que tanto le gusta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":387890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda y muebles para su negocio","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T03:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.53,"local_amount":92.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997501,"comment":null},{"amount":35.05,"local_amount":93.46,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":102.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842848,"comment":null},{"amount":106.29,"local_amount":283.43,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":310.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734427,"comment":null},{"amount":8.02,"local_amount":21.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":23.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959607,"comment":null},{"amount":41.11,"local_amount":109.64,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":120.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T20:17:45Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136705,"name":"Marissa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marissa S. is a rice grower from trento Agusan del Sur. she has two children.

She faces an obstacle because she does not have enough money to buy farming supplies. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to enable her to buy farming supplies for her plantation. Her husband, Mr. Kuoy Lyhuor, is a motorbike taxi driver. The couple has four children, one of whom is a construction worker, two of whom are enrolled in the local school, and one of whom is too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nFive members in this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allow the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Aside from this, Beatriz also travels to Dagupan City (approximately five hours from Ilagan, Isabela) twice a month in order to purchase fresh milk, fish, and other products like \u201cbagoong\u201d (shrimp paste) to retail in her village. This business gives her a net income of PHP 6,000 a month. She uses her income as rolling capital for the maintenance of her business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Beatriz would like her business to become more progressive.

S. said that it is hard to get to the field to work because he does not have his own vehicle. Therefore, he has decided to seek a loan to purchase a motorbike which he and his family will use to ride to work or elsewhere. With the remainder of the loan he will buy more carving tools for his business.

She wants to bring her children into a decent life. In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have access to capital for the continuation of her dying business. Her previous loans were carefully utilized as additional and rolling capital for her fish cage. A fish cage is used as a venue for fingerlings to be cultured until ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nNow on her 3rd loan, Juanita proposes a loan of 15,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish-cage business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for three rolls of assorted fish nets, a hundred pieces on bamboo, wires and other tying materials and also for labor expenses.\r\n\r\nJuanita is hopeful that her business will grow and that someday she will have more fish cages. She also dreams of sending all her children to school until college and that they find jobs.

Now on her third loan cycle, she is requesting a 8000 PHP loan with the cooperative to purchase more cosmetics for her clients. She will also use a portion of the loan to buy bananas in bulk.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":387995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more milk in bulk to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T16:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tully","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023044,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868285,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757481,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146575,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984720,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":38047.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T16:39:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136756,"name":"Hanaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanaa is a 44-year-old single woman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.

Suzana thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":388013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","use":"To open the same business at new location","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T09:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suzana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023046,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868287,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757483,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146577,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984722,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":86965.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015395,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-15T19:50:26Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136768,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna V. lives in the village of Mahinog, Camiguin.

Mukaddas is a hard-working married mother of three children. For the past nine years Mukaddas has dedicated herself to selling office supplies.

Without her husband\u2019s income, bills started to pile up so Mukaddas decided to generate her own income to fill the gap. She likes what she sells and has developed a stable enterprise. Now Mukaddas has requested a loan of 5000 TJS to help purchase a new supply of items to sell. This is an important matter for this family's well-being. Please help Mukaddas\u2019s business to grow.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married with three children. She is an energetic, enthusiastic entrepreneur who operates her business simply but wisely. An example of this is when she has needed to purchase new clothing inventory. Rather than close her business and travel herself to buy inventory, she has paid other clothing vendors to buy for her so that she can stay and keep her business open. Mukhlisa is asking for a loan to help renew her clothing inventory. The change of seasons means a busy time of year for clothing vendors and this loan will help Mukhlisa purchase a good supply so she can maximize her profits and continue working to develop her business. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

For about 20 years she is purchasing the young cattle and calves in the local market, fattens and sells them. Bashorat is a very hard-working woman and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. Bashorat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. Her husband (pictured) actively helps her with operations. Thanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. Bashorat wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her family consists of her husband, her 31-year-old son and herself. Seimkan is a school principal and sells milk, fifty liters a day. Her husband works as the deputy head of the local municipality, while her son is married and works at a police station. Seimkan and her husband used to live with his family and subsequently inherited some dairy cows. Through this inheritance she developed her dairy business, which brings in $90-95 every month. \r\n<p>\r\nRaising cows has been a tremendous extra source of income, enabling them to build a house of temporary construction in the village, buy a couch and armchairs and some other items for the home. Even though her son helps her deal with the cows, Seimkan would like to hire someone additional to look after the herd.\r\n<p>\r\nSeimkan is requesting a loan to purchase two year-old calves to fatten and some younger calves for breeding. Her ultimate goal is to have more cows than she has at the moment.\r\n<p>\r\nSeimkan\u2019s partners are Nurlan, Nasipa and Kenjegul. Nurlan, 27, is married and is the cake production foreman at a confectionary plant. His wife works at a caf\u00e9, and on weekends his parents look after Nurlan\u2019s cattle and farm. He is requesting a loan to buy two calves to fatten and resell.\r\n<p>\r\nNasipa, 47, is the mother of six children, five of whom are married and on their own. Her youngest child, a sixteen-year-old son, goes to school and lives with his parents. Her husband operates a telephone company. Nasipa sells milk and works as the head of curriculum at school. Nasipa is requesting a loan to buy a calf.\r\n<p>\r\nKenjegul, 55, is married. Her husband is retired and occupies himself with animal husbandry. They have raised four children, some of whom live separately, while some are still dependent.

She enjoys her life being a farmer\u2019s wife and has raised three children. Now she is 56 years old, and her eldest son and daughter are both married and live on their own. Only her twenty-year-old daughter, a college student, lives with them. Apart from farming and growing various things in the field, among all the pleasures of life in a rural area there is one that rewards her financially: selling milk.  Azykbubu\u2019s daily milk sales constitute around ten liters, which earns her about $55 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nNo matter how \u201cimperceptible\u201d the gift looks, Azykbubu still remembers with delight and gratitude the day when her parents\u2013in-law gave her one cow and three sheep as a present. Since that day she and her husband have been breeding cows. The profits from this venture have allowed them to buy tractors, provide for their children\u2019s education and increase their herd. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, Azykbubu needs a loan to buy another cow. This would help her increase the size of her herd and the amount of milk she could sell. Azykbubu\u2019s main goals are to give her daughter an education, marry her off and increase the population of her herd.\r\n<p>\r\nAzykbubu has three partners: Satybek, Kaldykul and Burulcha.\r\n<p>\r\nSatybek, 52, is married. He has a twenty\u2013year-old daughter. To make a living he is engaged in cattle breeding. His wife works as a charwoman at the school. Satybek needs a loan to buy a calf for breeding.\r\n<p>\r\nKaldykul, 52, has three children. Her husband is a shepherd, whereas she farms and sells milk. She grows barley, wheat and potatoes. Kaldykul\u2019s married son lives with his parents. Her daughter-in-law often helps her care for the cows. Kaldykul hopes to get a loan and buy two calves.\r\n<p>\r\nBurulcha, 49, is divorced and has one daughter. Even though she has had a hard time providing for her daughter, Burulcha has enough steadfastness and dignity to continue struggling to live. She sells milk and grows potatoes. Burulcha needs a loan to buy ten sheep for breeding.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout Mol Bulak Finance:\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is being presented by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious, socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

He would like to do more projects in the future and also improve his family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alfredo is a member of the Los Tijos Communal Credit Business, one of 100 EDESA member organizations in Costa Rica. This will be his fifth loan and he says that he hopes to continue growing his business and keep it moving forward successfully.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva

He lives with his wife and two university student children and who all help him with his vegetable planting and harvesting business. He started his business in 1995 with the help of his family. At the beginning they planted only small amounts of vegetables because of storage difficulties but as their business grew, they bought storage space to preserve the harvested vegetables.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T17:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023049,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868290,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757486,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146580,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984725,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015398,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T03:04:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":136996,"name":"Fatama Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatama is the group leader of Fatama Group.

from Tanzania! This is 45 year-old Judy M. from Mbeya. She is a widow with five children between the ages of 17 and 28.  Since 2000, Judy has been running a business purchasing and selling crops.  She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days a week and is assisted by two employees. Judy currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk.  In the future, she plans to improve the quality of her business. Judy thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase bulk

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is 45-year-old Faines M. from Mbeya. She is married with four children between the ages of 18 and 32. Since 2005 Faines has been running a genge business. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, from which the owner sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. \r\n<p>\r\nFaines works in her business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and currently earns about $80 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy more rice, sugar, beans and salt in bulk. In the future, she plans to renovate her store. Faines thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":388545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more rice, sugar, beans and salt in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T20:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023060,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868301,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757497,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146591,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984736,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015409,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T20:29:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137027,"name":"Rozimery","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nRozimery is a member of the Amani borrower group in Kinayanambo, Iringa. she is 24 year old woman, she is married and a mother of 2 children.

T. is from the village of Camanga, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Elvie has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Elvie joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to invest in expanding her business. Elvie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She is known to their village as a good sewer and she receive orders for her sewing services. Sewing is her primary business and she needs capital to sustain its operation. In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with hopes of having access to capital. She used her previous loans as rolling and additional capital for her sewing. She has been in the business for almost six years.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she seeks 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her sewing business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for a sewing machine worth 5,000 pesos and for assorted cloth and threads. She is hopeful that her business will grow and she even dreams of expanding it and to later hire workers. She also aspires to send her children to school until they finish college and to have a more spacious and comfortable

Jabbor is 59 years old. He is married and has 4 children. Jabbor's goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life to get ahead and to fulfill his goals. \r\n\r\nJabbor is a taxi driver who travels through the streets of Kanibadam, Tajikistan in search of customers. He has owned his business for 3 years. Currently Jabbor\u2019s car needs some repairs, so he wants to borrow 4500 Somoni. He will use the loan to buy spare parts for his car. Jabbor thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.     \r\n       \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His business lets him provide for all of the essential needs of his wife and their 7 children. He receives so many requests from his clients that he is forced to go to Ghana more once per month to restock his supplies.  All of his funiture is made of teak, a superior quality wood typically used in furniture manufacturing. He started his business in 2001 and his store is located in the Anfame quarter in the city of Lome.

She rents a frozen food store, and this business allows her to cover the store rent costs and to provide for all of the needs of the family. She set up her store in a well-travelled road, which is why she sees good business.  She even receives orders for certain holidays in the district. Many people look to her because her meat are of good quality. She is currently in need to restock her supply, which is the reason why she is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner).

He is married and he is the father of 3 children, still in his care. He has become the best autobody specialist because he has been in this occupation since 1994. Therefore as an experienced veteran in the field he opened his shop, located in the district of Ablogame in the city of Lome. He has many loyal customers that appreciate the work well-done. He also has a number of apprenticeships, given that many parents want their children to become like him. He currently requires a new painting tool, which is why he is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner). The loan will also be used to expand and improve his general auto mechanic workshop. He is very proud of his services and he has no concern over honoring his commitments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Erika Lindig, Kiva

From these three business activities, she earns an average amount of PHP 6,000 per month, which is enough to cover the college expenses of her only child, and the balance she plowed back into her business. She manages her cash flow well and was able to pay off her last loan of PHP 12,000 without missing a payment.\r\n\r\nNow, for her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ananita is borrowing another PHP 12,000 so that she can continue expanding the operations of her three business activities.

Helen A. lives in the village of Brgy. Cambaog, in the town of Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 43 years old and married with 4 children - the oldest is 23 and the youngest is 14 years old. Her main goal in life is to help her husband raise their family well while striving hard to move them out of poverty.\r\n\r\nBefore she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she thought that this was an impossible dream because how could she expect people to lend her money when she could not offer any collateral as a security for the loan? But she did not lose hope in looking for ways to earn a stable income so that she could send her children to school and sustain the daily needs of her young family. This is why Mrs. A. sought to become a member of  NWTF-Project Dungganon when she heard that she could borrow money without any collateral because it was the MFI's objective to empower poor women so that they could have a better future for themselves and their family. \r\n\r\nShe used her first loan to set up a rice retailing business and now 8 years later it continues to provide well for her family.  She profits about PHP 5,000 which she uses to pay the school expenses of her kids, support the needs of the household, and sometimes there is even enough to cover minor house repairs. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 was her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She used it to invest in a new business venture - raising livestock - and it was a good run; she was able to pay her installments on time and was able to pay off the whole loan without any delay.\r\n\r\nNow for her 13th loan cycle, Helen is again borrowing PHP 19,000 which she will invest in her general store and livestock raising business ventures as additional working capital, and she intends to use the income she gains from this to pay for the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":384336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Diosdado O. who, because of a lack of employment opportunities in their town, is presently employed as a security guard in Manila, leaving her to fend for their five young children who range in age from the oldest who is just 8 years old to the youngest who is just a week old.\r\n\r\nFinding herself in a situation where she is a single-parent of five very young children, and the wife of an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker), albeit without the perks of a dollar remittance, she was forced to think of ways to support her family because the money her husband sends home is just not enough for the needs of the family.\r\n\r\nAt first, Jonalyn started helping in her mother's candy-making business, and distributing the finished products to various general stores in her community and in the neighboring towns. As she proved to be a good businesswoman, her mother handed the reins of the candy business to her. Gaining confidence from her success in the candy business, Jonalyn started looking for other business opportunities within her area of expertise and she thought - why not try baked goods?\r\n\r\nBut Jonalyn did not have enough capital to start a bakery business, so when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2007, this was the business venture she wrote in her business proposal for her first loan. And even with just a very small loan, she was able to buy materials and equipment to start operations. Now, two years later, she is happy because she is now able to provide employment to eight people in her neighborhood whom she hired to help her in her bakery.\r\n\r\nHer success has not stopped Jonalyn from looking for more income sources - she also does direct-selling of beauty products in her community, and these activities earns about PHP 22,000 per month - enough to support her family, pay for her loan, and have enough left for savings for the future needs of her children.\r\n\r\nHer last loan of PHP 20,000 was fully paid on time, and without any delays. Now on her 9th loan, Jonalyn wants to borrow PHP 23,000 so that she can infuse additional capital into her bakery and other business ventures. She plans to use the income to invest back into the business while setting aside some money for the education of her young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She hopes that by providing them with a better education, they will be able to help her and her husband in their old age. \r\n\r\nElsie and her family live in Hacienda San Jose Baling, Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Her husband buys and sells livestock in neighboring towns. Elsie became engaged in food vending to supplement her husband's income. Grilled food is popular among Filipinos, and Negros in particular is famous for its barbecue chicken. Hence, Elsie decided to offer her clients a wide variety of grilled and barbecued food served hot off the grill. Elsie bought charcoal in bulk for her food business, and now also sells that to her neighbors to make extra money. \r\n\r\nFor two years, Elsie has enjoyed tending to her food business and helping her husband support their family. Her business earns an extra PHP6,000 per month. Elsie conscientiously divides her income, setting aside a certain amount for her children's future and to budget for her family's needs. She invests the rest of her money back into her business, and is a good money manager. She paid off her last loan, taken out for PHP15,000, with no problems. \r\n\r\nNow on her seventh loan, Elsie wants to borrow PHP16,000 so that she can purchase livestock, which she intends to raise and sell in the future. The income from this venture will again be saved for her children's education and to make repairs to her house. In this photo, Elsie is posing near her food business with a display of barbecued chicken parts, hot dogs and bread on a stick.

She is married to Hilario, who is a construction worker, and blessed with three adult children. Letecia is also an active member of her church council, is the chairwoman of the community outreach committee, and teaches catechism in school. Even while she keeps busy with her community work, Letecia still manages her many businesses very well despite her age. She continues working because it makes her happy to earn a daily income. \r\n<p>\r\nLetecia aimed to help her husband when she opened a general store using her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She noticed that the store provided a steady income if she just stocked it well with goods popular with her customers. To this end she invested in a refrigerator so that she could sell cold food and drinks.\r\n<p>\r\nLetecia did not stop looking for other business opportunities. This led her to invest in a food vending business selling fried chicken in her community. She also started a retail business in rice with her most recent loan. Because of her wise investments and her skillful business acumen, she is able to pay her loan installments on time and in full within the period she has promised. With her excellent credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia is being granted higher loans.\r\n<p>\r\nNow that two of her children are gainfully employed, the L. family\u2019s quality of life is finally on the rise. With her eighteenth loan, Letecia is proposing to use 29,000 PHP to invest in her general store and rice retailing business. She plans to use her profits to continue to expand her business operations while helping to support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

With this loan,  she expects to make a monthly profit of 90,000 F CFA which will allow her to fatten cattle and sheep and pay for clothing and medicine for herself and her children.  <P>\r\n\r\nHer
