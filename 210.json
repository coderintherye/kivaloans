At her young age, she feels responsible for helping out with the family expenses. She lives in her parents\u2019 house, and what she wants the most is to help them have a peaceful life.  For Bertha, her youth has not impeded her from getting ahead in life. She has been working in her own general store for 5 years, and what she likes most about her business is having conversations with her customers because it makes her long work days more enjoyable. Bertha was able to set up her general store thanks to her parents, who did not think twice about investing their life savings so that their daughter can be happy and form her own future.  Bertha hopes to have a bigger store in which she can sell her products with ease. What she most dislikes is that because of her small shop, she cannot serve too many customers at a time.

She lives in a small house that she built with her own hands.  What she wants most is to provide her 2 beloved children Luz (22 years old) and Dennis (17 years old) with a good education so that they can make it on their own in the future.  Cinforiana has raised cattle for 15 years now, and this activity has allowed her to make a decent living.  She has been involved in this line of work since she was 15 years old, and she is now one of the most famous livestock farmers in her area because of the large animals she takes to sell in the city of Juliaca.  Cinforiana is from the Taraco district (a district in the province of Huancane).  What she likes most about her work is raising her cattle, since she knows that the more she looks after her animals, the better the price she\u2019ll get for them.  However, it\u2019s quite difficult for her to transport them to market, since that\u2019s a task that requires much time and effort.  In the future she would like to have a grocery store, which would allow her to generate additional income and improve her family\u2019s quality of life.  This is Cinforiana\u2019s first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she understands the responsibility of making payments on time, since she doesn\u2019t want to cause any problems with her colleagues at the communal bank, where she is well liked because of the joy she brings to meetings.

Her children are what motivate her.  She has been learning to raise cattle her whole life.  She learned this work from her parents, who worked hard to give her a good life, when she was a small girl.  She brings her cattle to the Sunday fair in the Huancan\u00e9 neighborhood, where she gets a good price since her livestock are the biggest and strongest at the fair due to the good care she gives them.   She's been doing this for 6 years and what she likes most is feeding her animals.  In the future, she hopes to be able to increase the number of cattle she has and in this way improve her income.  The most difficult thing for Josefa is transferring her cattle to the fair because it's very tiring and slow. But she knows that she has to do it and is happy to work hard, hoping to reach her goals. This is Josefa's first loan with MFP and she's aware of the responsibility she has to pay it on time, even though she will have to save bit by bit to do it.  She is an active and supportive member of her communal bank which is why she is so respected by the rest.  With the 800 soles requested, she plans to buy a calf, which will cost about 700 soles.  The rest of the money will be invested in buying fodder for her cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":309967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de una ternera","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-27T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596143,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990412,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990413,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211531,"comment":null},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":141.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641038,"comment":null},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":144.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080497,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-27T21:47:28Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104687,"name":"Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Comenzo el negocio hace cuatro a\u00f1os, haciendo trabajos sobre pedido\ndesD. entonces poco a poco se ha vuelto un negocio para la familia.\nsu familia es su esposa, que trabaja D. secretaria y un hijo que es estudiante.\n\nTenia trabajo en una carpinter\u00eda y muebler\u00eda, pero se quedo sin el. \ny tuvo que hacer trabajos en su casa para poder mantener a su familia. \n\nCuenta solo con un empleado, que le ayuda cuando tiene muchos pedidos.\n\nsolicita el apoyo que ayudara a surtir el material que necesita.\n\n\n\n","en":"Enrique started his business four years ago, doing jobs on request which, little by little, has come to be a business for the family.

Vidal's day begins very early in the morning, when with his inseparable three-wheeler, he goes out searching for clients wishing to be transported to their destination.  His services are very sought-after around his neighborhood, since no matter how rushed they are, he is always there to carry them.  He has been doing this work for 4 years, and what he most enjoys is conversing with the other moto-taxi drivers while they are waiting for somebody to use their service, making his day pass more pleasantly.\r\n\r\nVidal hopes in the future to buy another three-wheeler to rent out and thus generate additional income.  What he likes least about his work is that he has to work all day long and is not able to watch over his children all the time, to whom he greatly desires to give a good education.  \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan Vidal has taken through MFP, he is very aware that he has to make every payment on time in order not to be detrimental to the other members of his communal bank, where he is very beloved because of the responsibility he demonstrates.

For 3 years she has been selling livestock, both for meat and for wool; depending on the type of animal, she tries to get the greatest benefit in order to have the best possible earnings.  In addition, in the morning she sells candies during snack time in the cafeteria of a private school near her house, which permits Elizabeth to have additional income to cover the educational expenses of her 5 children.  Occasionally her older children help her, since her husband works far away; nevertheless, this type of work has been able to cover the financial needs.  In the future she would like to have enough land to raise her animals, rather than on the patio of her house.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through MFP.  She is one of the most engaged members of her communal bank, being very dynamic and driven by responsibility to her group, which is why she has assumed the position of treasurer.

For 19 years, Irene has been selling potatoes, which she grows on her own land. Because she plants her own crops, most of her work takes place during the first three months of the year. Her husband is always by her side; they work together and care for their children together, too. Irene believes that her business is profitable these days because she sells what she produces, without any middle-man. Her husband also maintains a small vehicle, which he uses to transport merchandise and courier items for their neighbors. This is Irene's second loan with MFP, and she is excited to continue building relationships with other members of her community bank. With this loan, Irene will buy more potato sacks and fertilizer for the next planting season.

She learned this business from her parents, who always engaged in this business.  They still rely on this activity for their sustenance.  Rosa is very pleased with what she has achieved.  She buys the animals during the week. She then sells them, with the help of her husband and children, on Saturdays and Sundays in the livestock fairs in her area.  This business is profitable for Rosa.  She and her husband have plans to continue this activity and increase the number of animals they sell.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Rosa has asked for a loan from MFP.  She is very happy to be part of her community bank.  She was invited to join because they saw her as a good example of a responsible worker.

Every night, when she closes her stall at 9pm, she knows that the next day she will have to work all day again.

What she likes the least about her work is having to stay at her stall for so long because she is the only one who works there. Even so, she knows that her sacrifices are not in vain - she is working to give her children a brighter future. She also hopes to expand her business into a store, where she could sell a much larger variety of clothes.

Although her husband also works, he does not have a steady job, and for this reason, Muhayyo and her eldest son are in trade.  Muhayyo herself processes the salted apricot pits at home, and then exports them abroad.  It is hard work and time-consuming.  First, the apricot pits are cracked, then slightly blanched in a special brine.  After blanching, the pits are spread out in a thin layer in the sun to dry. The pits are ready for sale in a few hours.  Muhayyo's eldest son sells a variety of vegetables in the central market, and this also goes into the family kitty.  Since the price of apricot pits has now dropped and she wants to stock up for the future, Muhayyo decided to take out a small loan to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":310416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of apricot pits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-04T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhayyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":226.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":235.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":244.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":254.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":264.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":275.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.3,"local_amount":226.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":237.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600079,"comment":null},{"amount":62.72,"local_amount":235.19,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-26T07:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":247.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994493,"comment":null},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":244.59,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":257,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215743,"comment":null},{"amount":67.83,"local_amount":254.38,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":267.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645231,"comment":null},{"amount":70.55,"local_amount":264.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":277.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084801,"comment":null},{"amount":73.38,"local_amount":275.15,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":289.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T01:30:01Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104851,"name":"Juan Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan Alberto F. de 54 a\u00f1os de edad reside en Apopa junto a su esposa, la cual se dedica a los quehaceres del hogar.

Before, she worked for a government agency, but due to increasing needs of her family she had to leave her job and start her own business.

Several of her clients purchase kurpachi and them resell them at different markets. A few months ago, Ozoda took several neighboring girls as trainees and began teaching them how to sew. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ozodahon has an good sized outstanding order.

Her youngest is in the elementary level in the public school in their village.  \r\n<P>\r\nShe operates a small store in their village.  Her store is usually open from 6:00 in the morning until 9:00 in the evening.   Her income is quite small to support her family's needs, thus, she wants to borrow a loan of 17,000 Philippine Pesos to improve her business and be able to save something for the high school and college education of her youngest child.  The loan will be of great help for her store to become productive.  She dreams of having a more convenient store someday.  She is striving hard to send her child to school and have a better future.

L\u0129nh is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 05-\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n (10.15.05).\r\n<p>\r\nL\u0129nh is married and has three adult children. To make a living, L\u0129nh owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a business making mosquito nets. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and mosquito-net making services to local community members. L\u0129nh has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, L\u0129nh joined Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. L\u0129nh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,626,900 VND from Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She is now requesting a new loan of 1,626,900 VND which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. The loan will be the sixth loan taken out by the borrower from Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women. L\u0129nh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.

business sphere for several years. He used to sell dried fruit but, having gradually saved money, he opened a mini-canteen, located at the central market. Bahrom is also a cook by training. He has regular customers among the local vendors. In addition to the dishes offered in his canteen, Bahrom sells pastry: buns, cakes, ginger cookies, etc. Many of his clients, in addition to hot dishes, order dessert. Bahrom is 38 years old and is married with one child. His wife is a stay-at-home mom. Besides his main business, with the help of his wife Bahrom raises cattle. A year ago Bahrom got a Microinvest loan for this purpose, and got a reputation of a responsible and punctual client. He has recently submitted an application for another loan, which he is going to use for the purchase of a bull calf and fodder.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":310840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a bull calf and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahrom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084822,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-10T15:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:35:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":104979,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria P. is engaged in the hog-raising business.

She started doubling the size of her piggery. Now she wants to grow it even more to help her husband earn a living.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is asking for a loan of Php 12,000 from CEVI, a Kiva partner. She will use the loan to buy feed for all her pigs.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan is being requested by three borrowers, all of whom live in Khmounh Commune in Phnom Penh City. The group leader, Mrs. P. N., 35, has been a sewing worker in the garment factory for years. For that, she can earn a specific salary of $90 a month. The income she receives helps feed the family a little food and makes sure her two teenage children receive the highest education.

is a 54-year-old man who lives in Aley, Mount Lebanon, with his wife and their three children. Moufid has owned a barber shop for 30 years. He requested a loan of $1,000 from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua in order to purchase tools for his salon.

For that reason he wants to invest in his production, to expand his crop fields and to improve the quality of his products. Shermahmat knows that if he takes care of his land and works diligently he will reap excellent products that will have a better reception in the marketplace. The request Shermahmat makes is to purchase seeds, fertilizers, fuels and lubricants necessary for his land.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Takhmina is an enterprising woman. She is married and has two children. Her husband is a taxi driver and, as his salary has not been stable, sometimes they have accumulated debts. To help her husband, Takhmina decided to start her own business designing and making national dresses for women. She began her business after her first child was born and started with a small machine that she already owned. Now, she has a small workshop and two employees that help her cover the demands of her clients. The good service and fine quality she offers has made her business grow into a small company. Takhmina wants a loan of US$ 1500 to buy a sewing machine and material to help fill her customers\u2019 orders. She promises to return the loan in 12 months. The loan will help her business grow and improve the quality of life for this family. Takhmina sincerely thanks you for your help. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

J. is married and her husband is an entrepreneur. She has a son, who is the source of her inspiration and drive as she wants to give him a better life so that he can study and do well for himself. She started her grocery store six years ago to help her husband out financially. She started off with few products, but her business has grown as she has many frequent clients. Istoda would like a loan of $800 to buy merchandise so that she can offer a wider variety of products and so that her business can grow. Her clients are always asking her for new things. She will repay the loan over a period of 12 months. Istoda and her family thank you very much for your support, which means that her business can grow and she can fulfill her goal of providing for her family.<\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abduhakim is a 33-year-old cattleman who is married with three children. Owing to his father, who is a farmer, Abduhakim has been associated with this business since he was young. He purchases the cattle in the local market and then he breeds and sells them. The cattle are kept in the house and it takes a lot of effort to care for them. Every day, Abduhakim gets up early in the morning in order to feed his animals. And all day, until late at night, he is busy looking after the cattle.\r\n<p>\r\nAbduhakim says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with a proper education. Now, Abduhakim would like to expand his business and purchase two cows. For this purpose, he has applied for $800 and with your help he hopes to reach his aim. Be an important part of the growth of Abduhakim\u2019s business.\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The three preceding loans have been settled. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members do a diversity of work, including selling fruit and vegetables, condiments, peanut butter, and okra.  With this new loan, they intend to buy five packages of condiments, fifteen baskets of fruit and vegetables, two 100-kg sacks of peanuts (to make into peanut butter), and four sacks of okra powder.  Supplies  are gotten at the grand market of Kadiolo City and in neighboring towns.  The merchandise is sold at the market of Kadiolo City and often within the family.  The customers are composed essentially of women, who buy at the retail level in cash or credit transactions.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each envision realizing an average monthly profit of 18,500 francs CFA.  A portion of the profits will be used for day-to-day needs, and the other portion will be invested in the business.  The women of the group have the ambition to become wholesalers and to fix up their sales outlet.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":311003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Biba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":249999.99,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":254302.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020233,"comment":null},{"amount":170.82,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":84767.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242986,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84767.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678762,"comment":null},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84767.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-04T18:05:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":105055,"name":"Nurali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with her husband in a monogamous family with their two children and several other families in the Bagadadji district of S\u00e9gou City (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She began in commerce when she was a student.  She used to spend her major vacations at her uncle's.  There, he introduced her to small-scale commerce through the sale of children's clothing.  Little by little, Fatoumata acquired experience from him. \r\n<p>\r\nFive years ago, Fatoumata's own observations of the insufficient amounts of firewood in their area has lead her to opt for selling charcoal and firewood.  She is recognized in this business and enjoys a large customer base and renown in the district where she lives, which is Bagadadji.  Along with selling firewood and charcoal, she also sells fruit and ice cream. \r\n<p>\r\nNeeding to augment her capital and being concerned about satisfying the demands of her customers, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 42 months.  After three solidarity loans and two individual loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan in the amount of 225,000 francs CFA.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Nigora is a hardworking young woman who actively contributes to the well-being of her family by selling cottonseed oil in the market. She is married, but has not yet any children. She spends many hours at her small stand in the market waiting for her customers. In the traditional Tajik cuisine the majority of the meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil, especially our national dish \u201cPilaw\u201d which needs much cottonseed oil in order it to be delicious. So the goods that Nigora is selling are in popular demand among the population.\r\n<p>\r\nNigora realizes that, with the excellent quality and customer service she gives, she can grow her business. Today Nigora is planning to increase her business. For this reason she requests $800 for the term of 12 months. Nigora is counting on your help and thanks you for your support. \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anor is 44 years old and is married with five children. Anor is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife (pictured) and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Anor is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $650 in his business. In order to receive this amount, Anor has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, the country has a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is 36 years old. She is married and has given birth to five children. She says all her children are pursuing education in primary and junior high schools. She lives with her family in their own house at Oda, a farming community in the Eastern region of Ghana. Akosua works hard to support her husband to provide for the family. Her husband is a farmer who cultivates food crops and all kinds of vegetables.\r\n<p>\r\nAkosua sells foodstuffs. She sells plantain, cassava, yam, etc. on a table in the community market.

For the realization of her plans, she is now asking for a loan of PHP 6,000.00 that she will use for her hog-raising business. She believes that time is gold thus, as soon as possible she will invest her money in every business opportunity to grow and become successful someday. \r\n<p>\r\nFrema is 25 years old and married to Reymund, who works as a farmer in their community.

Her weekly net income is around 3,000 Philippine Pesos (about US $61) which they budget to support the basic needs of their family.  However, it is not sufficient to satisfy their needs; she and her husband are working hard to sustain their business for their future.
