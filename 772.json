Garnik's wife is a homemaker; his older daughter studies in the civil engineering faculty at the Kapan Polytechnical Institute; and his younger daughter finished secondary school this year.\r\n\r\nGarnik has been doing shoe repairs for 20 years. Ganik has his own machines and shoe molds, but he leases the shop where he operates his business.

So he developed his enterprise by purchasing a new mill (Tahoun) running on power and sold the previous mill. He is an incredibly hard-working man and as a result has a lot of experience. In addition, it is the only main source of  his income.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, through lots of effort he has managed to grind his customer`s grain,  i.e., he provides them a service to put food on the table. Recently, a drought has come for agricultural crops leading to a decrease of customers in his business. So, Ali took out a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase grain for his business.\r\n\r\n In the future, he would like to expand his business to have a grocery store because his region is lacking some services  which he could supply to solve people's needs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":58.54,"image":{"id":992442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase grains for his milling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":12544},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12496},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":12496}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.54,"local_amount":12544,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":12834.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263232286,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T20:51:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385423,"name":"Fadia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fadia is a 32-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and four school-age children.

She successfully repaid her first loan, and then decided to spread her wings a little more and start a bakery. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Taliea has been successful with her new business, making popular baked good the locals call \"tiri,\" a large bread made of flour and water only (sometimes with a little salt), baked on a surface much like an upside-down wok. The end product is a hard, dry bread which can be kept for months. Before it's eaten it is broken into smaller pieces, moistened, and kept wrapped in a cloth to make sure it doesn't dry out.\r\n\r\nTaliea is requesting a 1500 USD loan from RI-Iraq to improve the working space in her bakery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":992740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to improve her bakery workspace ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Taliea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T20:51:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376003,"name":"Odiljon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0436\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0410. \u0414\u0436\u043e\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0436\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.","en":"Odiljon lives in the region A.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20.83,"image":{"id":992743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T15:30:04Z","loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T16:26:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385467,"name":"Osman Y.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Presented to you in the photo above is Osman, a secondary school teacher in Makeni, a city in northern Sierra Leone.

Her family's primary business is animal husbandry and farming.  In 2005, Salkyngul decided to get involved in fattening up and reselling livestock, having invested an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock.  Today, her business contains ten sheep, one bull and one horse, and yields a monthly income of 8,000 som.  The profits from her business allow Salkyngul to pay for her oldest son's education.  In order to further develop her business, Salkyngul requested a loan in the sum of 110,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.

She runs her own store as a Champion Agent for Mobile Transactions in Solwezi providing money transfer services to her community.

Within a month of starting her business Angela was already doing more than 1000 money transfers a month. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction service by propagating an open network using small businesses called Champion Agents. Angela is a Champion Agent. This is her story. \r\n\r\nAngela believes her community benefits from her business in a very positive way because the service she provides is faster compared to other money transfer services and more often has enough cash to pay out receiving customers. She currently has one employee and two teller windows, which she uses to serve her customers. \r\n\r\nWhen Angela receives her loan she will be able to increase her float money (electronic and cash value of her working capital) which will enable her to satisfy more customers.

This has helped him to provide for his family even though it is not an easy undertaking. \r\n\r\nThe major challenge he faces in his business is that he lacks capital to expand his business. This has incapacitated his expansion. The other challenges come with him being the only one providing for the family, considering the high cost of living in the city.

Then he would also like to further his tertiary education and that of his children and dependents. His biggest dream is to build a house from the proceeds of his business because the cost of rent in Lusaka is currently high. \r\n\r\nDespite facing many challenges David says he has scored successes because every day he meets new people, and from them he has learned interpersonal skills as well as business and financial management skills which have helped him stay afloat--even through the economic hardships the country recently went through. David takes pride in knowing that before he started his business people did financial transactions using buses and other unsafe ways and that took a long time, but now using his facility people can send money quicker, more safely, and receive it instantly.

She lives in her own house, along with her husband, who works as a mechanic, and their son, who is a minor. Her business is in her home, making and selling tortillas and selling eggs. She has been working at this business for a number of years, and thanks to God and to her efforts, she has succeeded in keeping it active for a long time. In addition, she has been and continues to be their principal source of income, given that her husband cannot manage to cover the basic household expenses with the little money that he earns as a mechanic. Se\u00f1ora Maria is an incredible woman, charismatic and hard-working. Every day she goes through the environs of her community to offer cartons of eggs to the various shops. She has a number of regular clients, as much for the egg business as for the sale of her delicious tortillas. Like every entrepreneurial woman, she does not tire of working and betting on a better quality of life.

since the son was very young, and for whom he tries to get ahead every day. Daniel lives in the city of Pisco which has a hot climate, and where there are beautiful beaches and fishing is the main industry. \r\n\r\nDaniel earns a living raising pigs. He enjoys what he does very much, and at times he even gets quite attached to the smallest little pigs. He has been working in this business for two years with much sacrifice and constant struggle. He devotes himself to his business around three hours, getting up very early since he must feed the pigs and clean the area where they eat, because, Daniel tells us, they are like people in that where it's clean they eat well but if it's dirty they don't like it. He believes his business is going well because he's very dedicated to his work and because he raises the animals with respect. \r\n\r\nDaniel is very happy for the help offered by the Kiva lenders, since owing to that support he will be able to purchase commercial feed wholesale (since when one buys in small quantities it is very expensive). With this improvement he will be able to provide better nutrition to the pigs and thus the customers will be more confident in buying their meat. Above all he will have more income to be able to fulfill his great dream: \"that his son would stay in school in order to be better than him, because the only thing he can leave him as an inheritance, in case something were to happen to him, is education.\" \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":34.74,"image":{"id":991846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase feed for pigs.

They are also looking after their granddaughter Meibely for two months until their daughter comes back for her.\r\n\r\nTeodora has her own house in the San Ram\u00f3n district, located in the province of Chanchamayo. Teodora is a businesswoman who runs a stall at the Tirol waterfall, a tourist attraction that is visited by both local and international tourists. There she sells handicrafts such as bracelets, necklaces, earrings and ornaments for the home, all of which are made out of seeds from exotic plants. \u201cWhat I sell the most are the handcrafted monkeys made from coconuts at 10 soles, but I buy them at 5 so I earn double\u201d she says. Teodora also sells soft drinks and juice made from regional fruits such as cocona, aguaje and star fruit. \r\n\r\nIn the evenings Teodora sells kebabs, which are heartily welcomed by visitors. During the holiday months, at the end of the year and on national holidays her sales increase, due to the high influx of tourists. Teodora is happy with her job but hopes to see better results when she has more money to put into her business. \r\n\r\nThis will be the twelfth loan that Teodora will have been granted by MFP. She is thankful for their assistance and promises to repay her loans on time. Teodora belongs to the community bank \u201cThe  Heliconias\u201d and she feels comfortable with this group as she has now worked with them for more than five years.\r\n\r\nWith the money she will receive from this loan, Teodora plans to purchase more handicrafts from the city of La Merced to sell at her stall. The sales she makes this month will be crucial, so she doesn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.26,"image":{"id":991910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Comprar m\u00e1s objetos artesanales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":42.62},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":46.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":51.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":61.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.26,"local_amount":40.65,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386345,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T10:26:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":375838,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.63,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"truck maintenance and new driver's license.
