A year ago she spent her savings on building a small shop for consumer goods by her house in a small town of Toktogul. Every week she buys goods wholesale and sells them to the local population. The starting capital of 20,000 KGS was taken from the salary of her husband, who is a cab driver. Now Kanykei makes 5,000 KGS monthly, but because of the constantly rising costs of groceries, transportation and taxes, Kanykei is not succeeding in covering her costs. \r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan in order to cover all her expenses and broaden the assortment in her shop. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Twenty-five years ago, she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n\r\nHamidakhon is engaged in this business together with her family. Slowly the number of cows increased and with them, the requests of her clients increased. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps, and for this reason she is requesting a loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this purpose, Gulmira would like to get a loan of 20,000 KGS.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his four wives and their children in Medine, a popular quarter in the village of Sikasso (third administrative region in the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nAfter having tried many different business activities without success, notably agriculture and others, he soon started out the business of storage and sale of sweet peas, shea nuts, and cereal grains. He has been 10 years in the business. With this great amount of experience in the field, he enjoys a solid reputation and fame, and he receives many out of country orders. But he lacks the necessary resources to satisfy the demand.\r\n\r\nTherefore he joined Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner) two years ago and since then he has accessed three loans, all of which were successfully repaid. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of satisfying the demand of an ever growing clientele, he requests a fourth loan from the institution. He will be able to purchase 10 sacks of sweet peas, 3 tons of corn, 5 sacks of millet, and 10 sacks of shea nuts. \r\n\r\nHe makes his purchases in the surrounding regions of Sikasso and he stores the products in his store located in the new market of Medine Sikasso. He later transports the products to Abidjian and Bobo Dioulasso (located in the Republic of Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, respectively) on demand from sweet pea juice factories and shea butter factories. He sells cereal grains both on wholesale and in retail. \r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan he expects to earn a monthly income of 200 000FCFA. This income will serve to provide for his basic needs and those of his family, as well as to repay his loan and to invest back into the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":692346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase sweet peas and shea nuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":252026.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226409,"comment":null},{"amount":512.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":252026.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750680,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T07:23:02Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265065,"name":"Kulsiyna's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since ancient times the Kyrgyz people have been some of the best livestock breeders and farmers. Leading a nomadic lifestyle, they have worked out special strategies for raising healthy cattle high in the Kyrgyz mountains.\r\n\r\nKulsiyna K., 44, is the leader of this group, consisting of four experienced and ambitious cattle-breeders. Five years ago, having some savings and a big desire to start a successful business, she had to decide where to invest her start up capital. A widow with three sons living apart, Kulsiyna started with purchasing just a few head of cattle. She would feed and look after them carefully and go to the nearest stockyard to sell them. \r\n\r\nSoon she found out that the more carefully you look after cattle, the more productive you are going to be. Over these years she\u2019s been quite successful, and now that she is more confident and experienced, she would like to try raising sheep and goats, which are also in high demand. \r\n\r\nKulsiyna hopes to obtain the loan in order to purchase sheep and goats, since a monthly income of about $44 is unfortunately not enough. In the future she would like to help her sons arrange nice wedding ceremonies with lots of guests and good memories. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He\u2019s a resident of a small town with a population of 16 000, called Toktogul. Bakhtiyar was not lucky enough to obtain a university education, so he had to search for a job right after his high school graduation. Cars have been his passion since early childhood. After getting his driver\u2019s license, he decided that his favorite occupation, driving, could also be a good means of revenue. Bakhtiyar\u2019s taxi route is between Toktogul-Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan). He has acquired regular clients and drives up to 600 kilometers per route. Bakhtiyar sees his car as a main source of income, so he requested a loan in order to replace the engine and some parts. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite his difficulties, Konichbek made every effort to provide his children with all they needed.

Over time, Luz would like to add other new items to her business, providing her customers with a better service by giving them more variety.\r\n\r\nThis is Luz' first loan with MFP.

She will use this loan to purchase sausages, cheese, eggs, bread, fruits, candies and other food. She hopes that she can save profits to invest later in her business and begin to study English, one of her dreams.  She also  wants to meet her most difficult challenge: legalizing her status in the Dominican Republic. \r\n\r\nRamona's home is in a village called a Batey, a small town surrounded by a sugar cane field. This one is located in San Pedro. Bateyes are poor rural communities built by sugar companies to house their field workers. Over time, conditions in these communities have deteriorated badly, and houses are in poor shape. Bateyes typically lack potable water and any kind of reliable electricity.

She is requesting  this loan to acquire basic material to start selling food and Mexican dishes. In the near future she wants to remodel her home in order to increase her sales and thus be able to offer her daughter and husband a better quality of life.

A few years ago, he had to close it down and move out of the city because it wasn\u2019t safe there anymore. Now, he wants to open a new carnicer\u00eda in El Paso, where he currently lives. \u201cIt started as a dream two years ago\u2026I created a six year plan then.  The Small Business Administration helped orient me on how to build a business here. And now I can start my business with ACCION\u2019s support.\u201d His business is opening on January 14th. Daniel calls it an American dream.\r\n\r\nDaniel is only 40 some years old, but says, \u201cSome people think that an elderly person can\u2019t improve their life; they\u2019ve already reached their capacity. But I don\u2019t believe that. If you have your health, you still can grow\u2026 It\u2019s never too late to pursue what you want in life.\u201d His goal is to grow his business earnings to $300,000 a year and for his business to be well known in the area. If things go well, he\u2019d like to open another store. Daniel sees a need for carnicer\u00edas like his \u2013 and a lot of competition. \u201cHere in El Paso, 80% are Hispanic.  We have to support the needs of people of my race, who are Mexican\u2026 People are leaving Juarez for El Paso\u2026  There are many business people, small and large, who are coming here with Mexican brands.\u201d\r\n\r\nDaniel is using this loan to buy store inventory like meats, fruit, vegetables, soap and things to clean clothes with \u2013 all the necessities. Daniel is reserving some of the loan as backup in case something happens. \u201cEvery business starts at zero. You have to have some reserves to start off with. The first 5-6 months is a process of building up credit\u2026and saving money.\u201d Daniel says this is the reason for his loan: \u201cThis money - is so I have that support, so I have that money to start off with. I would have started in any case, but I\u2019d have less security. With this loan, I am less worried.\u201d\r\n\r\nDaniel plans to employ one person part-time. He also supports himself and the youngest of his three sons, who is still an adolescent. Daniel gives the advice that \u201ceverything that you do and all the dreams you have in your life; you have to fight for them. A dream becomes a plan becomes a reality. You can achieve what you want, but you have to be very persistent\u2026 This country is a country of many opportunities, and I\u2019ve learned that firsthand. There are people that want to help you, but you have to go knock on doors to find them.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can contact Daniel at

","en":"Raymunda, who is 46 years old, lives with her husband Guillermo (46) and their 6 children, together in their own house. A long time ago, Raymunda worked for a coffee grower, and received a good wage, but her ideas were not taken into account. After some years she ventured into agricultural activities, specifically the production and marketing of coffee, coca and cocoa. This allows her to make her own decisions, and since then she has had good results. In addition, her customer base is growing, and consequently her income is stable. This is due to her constant work, along with her partner, and the support of their workers. Usually she sells her cocoa, coffee and coca to merchants. She works Monday to Saturday, from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening. Her plan for the future is to continue betting on agriculture, and she wants to buy more farmland with the intent of increasing her agricultural production. This is her first loan with MFP, and she pledges to meet her repayment obligations. She feels empowered by her communal bank, since its members have given her a lot of help. Raymunda plans to invest the requested money in maintaining her farm products with the purchase of manure and fertilizers, and in this way she hopes to continue her progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":692720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase manure and fertilizers to improve her crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raymunda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1045.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850544,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-15T16:14:38Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265228,"name":"Maria Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Luz P.

","en":"Ruth Q., 38, is a hard-working woman.  She lives in a house that she owns with her husband, Nelson (48), and their two young children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life.  Ruth opens the store, in the little town of Kimbiri, every day at 5:00am to sell her merchandise.  Business is brisk because she is a very persuasive saleswoman and often convinces her customers to buy more than they came in for.  What she most enjoys about the business is talking to her customers, something that she makes the most of to entertain them a bit.  Ruth has operated the business for 7 years and she thinks the most difficult thing about it is having to always be in the store, waiting for customers, without being able to go out for long.  In the future, she hopes to save enough money to buy more merchandise so that she can provide her customers with a wider range of merchandise.  This is Ruth's sixth MFP loan and she understands that she has to repay the loan in the agreed-upon increments.  She is a popular member of her community bank.  She will use the one-thousand new soles loan to buy products to stock her business so that she can provide a better service to her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":692729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Buy merchandise to stock grocery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":153.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":165.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":174},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":153.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":160.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463806,"comment":null},{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":165.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887195,"comment":null},{"amount":62.12,"local_amount":165.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":173.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327554,"comment":null},{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":168.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":176.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196091,"comment":null},{"amount":65.25,"local_amount":174,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":181.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269770,"comment":null},{"amount":67.24,"local_amount":179.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":187.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549787,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T04:05:04Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265234,"name":"Miguel Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel Angel C.

She is a friendly, courteous woman who tends to the constant stream of customers who come to her shop looking for the unique items of clothing that she brings from the city.  What she most likes about the business is helping her customers find the articles of clothing that best suits them.  She has operated the business for eight years and says that the most difficult thing about it is having to tend the shop all days because she starts at 5:00am and works until about 10:00pm.  In the future, she would like to have a larger store so that she can provide even better service to her customers.  This is Teofila's second MFP loan and she knows that she has to repay it in the agreed-upon time if she wants to receive future loans, something that she'd like to do.  She is a popular member of her community bank, always full of good cheer at bank meetings.  She will use the two-thousand new soles loan to buy clothing that she will bring from Lima--preferably summer clothing because that's what her customers demand in this steamy part of Peru--so that she can continue to grow her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":692740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy merchandise for clothing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":307.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":317.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":331.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":337.36},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":347.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":359.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":111.44,"local_amount":307.43,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":310.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463808,"comment":null},{"amount":114.94,"local_amount":317.06,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":320.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887197,"comment":null},{"amount":120.06,"local_amount":331.2,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":334.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327556,"comment":null},{"amount":122.29,"local_amount":337.36,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":340.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196093,"comment":null},{"amount":126.12,"local_amount":347.92,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":351.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269772,"comment":null},{"amount":130.15,"local_amount":359.03,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":362.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549789,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T09:00:58Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265239,"name":"Gladis Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Gladis dedicada a la venta D. productos D. primera necesidad y tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta D. y otros productos a pedido del cliente ella entrega sus productos a cr\u00e9dito y va cobrando semanalmente o quincenal, la se\u00f1ora es  una mujer emprendedora entre las muchas que salen adelante solas por esfuerzos propios.

The couple have five grown up children who live independently.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman's business selling soda and beer is one of the busiest in the town of San Francisco.  Her great charisma and the kindness with which she serves her customers have made her business the most popular among her neighbors who don't hesitate to make their purchases in her store since they know that it is a business that is at its customers' disposal.\r\n\r\nWhat Violeta most likes about her work is chatting to her customers about their problems and giving them advice.  She has been in this business for two years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is putting up with the odd drunk who tries to go too far with their purchases.  However, she always puts them in their place.  She often has to serve non-stop if she  doesn't want her sales to drop.  In the future, she hopes that her business will grow and become the most popular in her town.\r\n\r\nThis is Violeta's second loan with MFP.

Selling groceries has provided a good income and, thanks to this, she was able to buy a plot of land to help her family.  Her future plans include buying a car to be able to deliver to her good customers.  This is Yessica's eighth loan with MFP and she feels that the loan money will greatly help her business to grow.  In her bank she is a very well-liked woman who works well with others.  She will use the 1,000 nuevos soles to buy more groceries to better stock her store and to carry more products.  In this way, she hopes to continue to move forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":692771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more groceries for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":153.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":165.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":174},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":153.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":160.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463811,"comment":null},{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":165.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887200,"comment":null},{"amount":62.12,"local_amount":165.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":173.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327559,"comment":null},{"amount":63.27,"local_amount":168.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":176.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196096,"comment":null},{"amount":65.25,"local_amount":174,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":181.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269775,"comment":null},{"amount":67.24,"local_amount":179.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":187.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549792,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T05:56:33Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265252,"name":"Jose Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es cliente de 19 a\u00f1os de edad que reside junto a sus padres en uno de los caser\u00edos que conforman el distrito agr\u00edcola de Tambogrande, perteneciente a la regi\u00f3n Piura y se encuentra situada a 4 horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica a la crianza de ovinos, los cuales alimenta por un periodo de tiempo para comercializarlos posteriormente con los pobladores de su zona.

He began \"G. NT, Inc.\" because he saw that people within the small business community needed assistance bringing companies to scale. He has always been interested in the difficulties that businesses face, so when he learned about coaching, he knew this was the perfect job for him. Homero says his competencies are in understanding growth and in teaching, which makes him a successful coach. He helps entrepreneurs build infrastructure in their businesses and teaches them about leadership and communication. He works individually with entrepreneurs to develop a program that is based on their specific goals and needs. Homero likes to work with a business for about a year in order to identify problems, talk through the issues, and implement solutions with the entrepreneur. He works with established businesses as well as emerging ones.  \r\n\r\nHomero says that the success and growth of the businesses he works with has to do with the commitment of the entrepreneur. As for his business, he is in the process of writing a growth plan. At the moment he is the only coach at the firm, but he is developing a framework to teach others how to coach. Homero wanted a loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana in order to help expand his presence on the web, which is another important way to grow the company.  \r\n\r\nHe describes his coaching as \u201cnot so much listening, but having the hunger to hear what people say in their own contexts.\u201d He was trained as a social scientist, so he has a strong theoretical background in organizational behavior that helps him succeed at his job. Homero deeply believes in what he does because he knows how important these businesses are to the entrepreneurs who run them. Small business owners invest their whole lives into building their businesses, which is why growth is so important for them.

To make a living, she owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, detergent powder and toothpaste in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $136 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. \r\n\r\nJocelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like canned goods and biscuits. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is requesting a new loan to be able to stock up, as she already has several orders for clothing and shoes and does not have the necessary money for this investment. For this reason, she is requesting your support in this loan so that she can buy the order, so that her customers will keep buying."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":693191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"the purchase of merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nuevo Laredo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"27.5 -99.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Refugio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7346.53,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":395.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":425.47},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":458.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":493.06},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":530.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":571.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":615.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":662.14},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":712.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":767.32},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":826.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":889.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265366,"name":"Carla Ninoska","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carla de 37 a\u00f1os de edad es soltera, labora para la Alcaldia de Juigalpadesde hace 10 a\u00f1os como responsable del departamento de fiscalizacion.

They have these chickens for two months so they can later slaughter them and take them to the local markets and the Portoviejo market. They work every day feeding and taking care of the chickens so they can have good production.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used for additional inventory and working capital. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, and as savings for future use, especially for future business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":692413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Additional inventory and working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carangan, Ozamiz City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2011-01-16T03:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":923.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195902930,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":923.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201344881,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-29T07:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":923.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206212404,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":923.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211287655,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":923.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216567649,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":923.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221737348,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T04:02:51Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:23:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":265389,"name":"Carmela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmela es una cliente de 29 a\u00f1os de edad,  que vive junto a sus hijos en casa propia, la cual ha construido con mucho esfuerzo y abnegaci\u00f3n.

is a married woman who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: frozen products and pig fattening businesses. Her husband Marcellus T., who is 46 years old, works as a employee (fishing vessels) to earn his living. They have three children who are 14 to 23 years old. Joyce joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joyce has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to pay for more purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for future for family needs. Joyce is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Mernel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mernel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to use to pay for more funds in business operation so that she could continue to save up for future family needs.

She is 40 years old. Elsa is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElsa is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsa owns & operates a direct selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soaps, toothpaste,& beauty products in the local community. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elsa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Elsa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. Rosalina has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosalina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nRosalina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Rosalina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

S. is from the village of Quiboro, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. He is 24 years old. Eric is single. To make a living, Eric owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorela or habal-habal services to local community members. Eric has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Eric joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eric is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Eric from HSPFI.

C. is from the village of Iponan, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 46 years old. Corazon is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Corazon owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from dealing and selling clothing, cosmetics and shoe products from NATASHA & AVON in the local community. Corazon has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Corazon joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like blouses and under wears. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Corazon from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

A. is from the village of Upper Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 43 years old. Fe is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Fe owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling seafood products including fish in the local community. She is also buying and selling vegetables like squash and eggplants. Fe has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Fe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish and vegetables. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Fe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
