Kiva borrower is a 51-year-old married man living with his wife and four young children. Some of his children are still attending school. He is from Lebanon. He has been involved in the agriculture field for the past 30 years. In 1992, he started running his own farm. He cultivates all types of fruits and vegetables according to the season, in addition to cultivating olives. He uses plastic tents to monitor his product quality better during the year.

She is 37 years old, married, and has 2 children.  She lives and works in Thieu Hoa district, a  rural area in Thanh Hoa province.  \r\n\r\nDung works in agriculture, raising poultry and\u00a0cattle.  She has been involved in this business for 8 years.  She is requesting a loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Dung joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to improve her  business.

She is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is N. X\u00e1 1 - Nh\u00f3m 18 (18).\n\nThoi  is married and has 4 school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising livestock, primarily chickens, for sale. Thoi has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3,200,000 VND a month from it.\n\nIn 2007, Thoi joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Thoi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Thoi's 4th loan from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and to buy ducks.\n\nAbout SEDA:\n\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nThoi  0 (0) l\u00e0 47 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Her husband cannot send all his income home as he also needs money for his living. Dince has been running her kiosk business for one year. \r\n\r\nWith a small amount of capital, Dince started her kiosk business by purchasing products such as rice, cooking oil, soap, detergent, cigarettes, etc.  In addition to running her kiosk business, Dince also loves to cultivate bitter melon. It takes three months to harvest, then she sells them at Oesao Market.\r\n\r\nDince feels that through this business she can support her children's daily needs and education, as she is able to earn more income. She plans to buy 2 display windows to put stock in and also more inventory.  She is requesting a loan of IDR 10,000,000 from TLM. She hopes that TLM is willing to assist her by providing the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":519.37,"image":{"id":781666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is 38 years old. She is married and has three children. Barnokhon is engaged in an animal husbandry and has been running this business for 8 years.  She also grows apricots. Currently, her husband is working in Russia and sends his family 200-300 USD every month. Barnokhon would like to get a loan of 5,400 TJS to expand her land for apricot farming.  She has received 2 cycles of loans from Imon International and has a good credit history.\r\n    \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has made a loan request of 50,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase chickens and chicken feed.

He has been running his business for years. He has acquired solid experience in this area. Marcel has already used seven Hope loans (a DRCongo Microfinance Program) to finance the expanding of his inventory and he paid them back correctly. Due to the high demand in his community, he intends with the next loan to buy more goods for resale in order to meet clients demand and generate additional profit.

In the future, Lola would like to improve her production to have better prices which is why she is asking for your help to be able to meet her goals. This is her fourth loan with MFP and feels that this loan will be very helpful as she continues to grow as a farmer. In her communal bank, Lola is an active and supportive member.

He lives in his own home and is prepared to work very hard to be successful in life.  Odias's day starts very early.  At approximately 6:00 in the morning he leaves with his inseparable \"motocarro\" (a three-wheeled van) in search of people who need his services.  Odias is a very charismatic person, which has helped him to have no lack of customers and one of the most requested \"motocarros\" in his neighborhood.  What Odias likes best about his work is talking with the passengers and making their trip more enjoyable.  Odias has been in this business for 6 years.

That is why he is asking for assistance in realizing his plans.

She is a very kind and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 55 year-old Alipio, and her two beloved children: 16 year-old Elizabeth and 12 year-old Jireh, who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCimi has worked hard her whole life in order to get ahead.  She has been making clothes for 12 years and her work has provided her with the money she needs to get her family ahead in life.  She is very talented with a sewing machine and, for this reason, institutions fight to hire her services.  What Cimi most enjoys about her work is filling her orders since she knows that her reputation is at stake.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be the long nights that she has to work in order to fill her orders.  However, even so, she knows that this is her work and that she must get it done.  Cimi would like to add a brand name to her clothes and become well known in the market.  She is requesting the collaboration of each and every one of you so that she can achieve her goals.\r\n\r\nThis will be Cimi's twelfth loan from MFP.  She feels very happy to have obtained her loan and is ready to make all her repayments on time.  She is a very well-liked member of her community bank because of the happiness that she brings to the group.

She is 40 years old and a cheerful and hard working woman. She lives in her own home with her husband Albino, who is 43 years old. Together they have 9 children, to whom they want to offer a better quality of life. The hard work that Juliana does with her spouse in their fields have made their crops be very well cared for. Because of this, their products are the most in demand. Her main source of income is the sale of cacao, coffee and plantains. She has 38,400 meters of cultivated land. She sells her products in the city of San Francisco and at harvest time hires day laborers to help in the planting and harvest of her products. What she likes the most about her work is the harvest, because it is the reward after so much hard work and dedication to her plants. She has been doing this for 20 years and thinks that the hardest thing is protecting her crops from insects, since they are constantly attacking her plantings.

He knows how to plant his crops correctly because of the constant trainings he receives from agricultural engineers. His product with greatest demand is coffee beans. He has good quality products and as a result he receives a good income. He usually works alone, but during harvest times he hires laborers so that he can harvest the crops more quickly.

Melva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional stocks for her store. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 120 talas or US $50 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Melva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.

is 57 years of age and married with three children. Hinemoa is starting a business venture, selling to the local community  baked food such as pudding, cupcakes and pineapple pie. Hinemoa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale, such as baking powder, sacks of flour, sacks of sugar and some flavoring.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Hinemoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Rarotonga's 2nd loan with SPBD.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Solopeta's 5th loan with SPBD.

is from the village of Sagrada Familia, Tambulig Zamnboanga del sur. He is 43 years old. Leonilo is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Leonilo owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Leonilo has been engaged in his business for over 21 years and earns approximately 12745 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leonilo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used  to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Leonilo is requesting a new loan of 40000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. It will also help him to finance for farm maintenance. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Leonilo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy vegetables, fish and other grocery stocks to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNilda hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to have a stall in a big marketplace. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy vegetables, fish, and other grocery stocks to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarites hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
