Anis would like to continue helping her husband, who makes a living as a printer. He recently received a large order and needs to buy toner and paper to complete it. She has applied for this loan to allow him to buy these supplies. We believe she will pay the loan back because she has a strong record of making payments on time and has never missed a meeting of our organization.\r\n\r\nNote: In this photo of her loan group, we see one of the embroidered dresses she has made."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":574698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy supplies

G. Ndung\u2019u  is thirty-six years old and married, but he does not have any children yet. His business is located by the roadside near  a primary school in Nairobi and is well known by the name Beba beba Hardware. He has been selling cement, iron sheets, paint, wire mesh, and other items. He sells to the local people and also to walk-ins from far from where his business is located. \r\n\r\nJohn has been doing this business for six months  now and has two employees.

Kiva borrower from Lebanon is a 50-year-old married woman and has one child. She has established a clothing and shoe store in her town since 2008. With her business she became able to earn income, pay for her child's education, and help her husband with the household expenses. She always tries to display a new collection to attract customers to her shop. She is asking for a loan of US$ 1,200 to expand her inventory of new collections. She hopes that her diverse selection of clothes and shoes will continue to generate good profits and enable her to expand her business even further. She expects her productivity and income to increase in the coming year.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Today women play a vital role in their communities, in improvement of living standards and overall economic growth. When a foreigner goes to any local market in Kyrgyzstan, he can see that the majority of shop assistants and sellers are women. This occurrence shows that old stereotypes about women as housewives have begun to disappear. \r\n\r\nBuraima M. is the leader of this group. She is sixty-four. Both she and her husband are retired. However, Buraima prefers to lead an independent life and therefore still makes her living by cattle breeding. Besides, she and her husband obtain a pension, which amounts to 4400 soms a month. She combines cattle breeding with farming as she also possesses a piece of land where she grows potatoes and cabbage. Another source of income comes from selling milk. \r\n\r\nBuraima\u2019s two sons are engaged in construction and sometimes help their mother in her activities. Due to these joint businesses, Buraima has successfully married off her sons and increased the total population of her livestock. Now Buraima needs a loan. She hopes that with this loan she will be able to buy two sheep. \r\n\r\nBuraima\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nRukiahon B., 54, is a mother of four children. Two of her sons are working in Russia.

Nagcuartelan, Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 43 years old. Luz is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Luz owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Luz has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luz joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Luz is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offerings. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Luz from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

A. is from the village of Gappal, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 59 years old. Angelita is married and has 1 adult-aged child. To make a living, Angelita owns & operates a business venture in the services sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing tailoring in the local community. Angelita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Angelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Angelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a working lady. She sells bangles and ready-made clothes to share the financial burden with her husband. Her husband is a fruit vendor. He sells fruit by going to different areas of the community on his bicycle. He visits different places in the city to sell his fruit. He earns approximately 12-15 thousand PKRs every month, which has become insufficient to meet the financial expenses of his family. Because he used to buy fruit on a daily basis, he has to pay first. Now he has decided to start supplying the fruit to different fruit shops so he gets the required income with profit on the same day. \n\nTherefore, Khairan has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband. With the loan, he will be able to buy seasonal fruit in bulk and sell it to more fruit shops. She is hopeful that, in this way, her husband can increase his income sufficiently.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 21-Dien Bien (03.05.21).\r\n\r\n\r\nDiep is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, Diep owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community.  Diep has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Diep joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Diep has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.248.000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5.310.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Diep plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  N. T.

After the death of his father, he decided to stop his education and start working to earn income for his family. He started working as a constructor specialized on gypsum board work. He works with his brothers to cover the family expenses, home rental, hospitality expenses etc. He has been involved in his occupation for the past 5 years and he has been able, despite his young age, to build a good business reputation where a lot of entrepreneurs ask for his construction services. He is asking to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional construction tools because his work is increasing and he needs to be prepared for any new projects.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

For the past two years she has been selling food produce: vegetables such as egg plants, onions and cassava, at the market in Rugombo, and she sometimes provides supplies to the central market in Bujumbura. She went to primary school up until sixth grade and she is divorced. She is taking out a seventh community loan from Turame.\r\n\r\nShe is mother to six children aged 13, ten, nine, and seven years old, as well as twins of three years old. The four eldest children are at school.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a Kiva loan in order to increase the quantity of food products she buys to resell to her customers. With the profit she generates from this loan, she is hoping in the future to be in a position to buy a piece of land in order to build her own house and to provide for her various needs. \r\n\r\nShe

The city suits everyone:  the broad choice of work, the shiny streets, the entertainment, and the promising prospects of great success.  Only a few youth risk remaining in their native villages and building a life there where others have long since lost hope.  The heroes of our story are some of those few people who have decided to remain and achieve success gradually. \r\n\r\nNurjamal I. is forty-six years old.  Nurjamal is the mother of three children.

Seven years ago she took out a loan and bought calves.  The son has grown up and taken his father\u2019s place, doing all the work at home himself.  The second son has decided to work in construction, and the daughter finished tenth grade this year.  By working together over the last seven years,  Nurjamal\u2019s family has managed to buy a plot of land and build a house.  Nurjamal does not wish to rest on her laurels.

First, he becomes patient and prudent. Sweat spilled and effort expended imparts thrift and respect for work as a whole. For this reason, even during times of unemployment and economic decline, the heroes of our story once again show that hardworking people always find work. \r\n\r\nObidohon J. is the leader of this group.  She is sixty years old, and after her husband\u2019s death she was left with two children.  Fortunately, her children have grown up, married, and now there are even grandsons to help Obidohon with her business.  Obidohon works raising cattle and cultivating cotton.  Her elder son is thirty-nine, and her younger son is thirty.  Both of her sons have left to work in the Russian Federation.  However, they left only when they were convinced that the grandsons could look after their grandmother and take care of the household.  Obidohon has been working in animal husbandry for twenty-five years.  Earlier, Obidohon only grew cotton. However, through Obidohon\u2019s diligence and hard work, she produced enough cotton to allow her to buy livestock and begin to raise cattle.  She has managed to marry off her sons and is already thinking about celebrating the weddings of her grandsons. Obidohon is asking for a loan to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nObidohon\u2019s partners in the group:\r\n\r\nDilmuradjan M. is forty-one years old.  Dilmuradjan has two daughters and one son. The entire family works cultivating and harvesting sunflowers, potatoes and carrots. Dilmuradjan recently has begun building a new house.  Now he hopes to obtain a loan to buy building materials. Dilmuradjan expects to receive a second harvest this season, and now all his efforts are directed towards this.\r\n\r\nDilnoza K. is twenty-five years old.  She is married. Dilnoza\u2019s husband is a freelance builder. To help her husband, Dilnoza works in animal husbandry.  She fattens cattle and resells it in the cattle market.  Dilnoza is asking for a loan to buy calves.  In the future, Dilnoza would like to construct a big stable.\r\n\r\nHaticha M. is fifty-three years old.  Haticha is a widow and the mother of two children. So as not to be dependent on her children, Haticha industriously works fattening cattle.  She has a cow with a calf and two sheep. She also sells milk.  Haticha wants to take out a loan to buy a sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

is a very responsible and hardworking father who has been dedicated to his business of buying and selling clothing for many years. The need to improve his income and provide education to his two dear children is the reason he is courteously requesting this loan. Kodirjon has so far accessed loans from Kiva partner, IMON International, twice and has seen his business expand. With the income, he said he was able to educate his children, which is most important to Kodirjon. Today, he is requesting a loan of 5000 TJS to expand his business so that he can generate more income for the wellbeing of his family. Kodirjon is very grateful to everyone who helps him achieve his dreams with this loan. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

a sharp, energetic entrepreneur from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, started her own clothing business 16 years ago and has built a successful enterprise. She has a good location in the market for her sales, along with an attractive display of clothing for passing customers. Nodira is a married woman with three children, and her income helps her to support her children's pursuit of a good education. \r\n\r\nNodira has requested a loan of 7500 Somoni so that she can purchase new clothing inventory. This loan will allow her to increase her income by having the right clothing available to meet seasonal demand. Over the last three years, Nodira has proven to be a great loan client with IMON International, and we are glad to have this new opportunity to continue assisting her with her business.  <p>\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Faizali is 49 years old. He is married with three children. After getting married, he arduously dedicated himself to the livestock business. When he recognized the need to invest in his work, Faizali decided to construct a place to keep his animals and for this he requires certain construction materials to accomplish the task at hand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, she hopes to open a small beauty shop where she can continue her work full-time.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for micro-loan borrowers.

She is a relatively new business owner\u2014she opened her own mini-market almost two years ago. She sells food products, cereals, detergents, bread, soft drinks, etc. Today, she is requesting to borrow US$ 1,000 to increase her store inventory in order to increase her sales and thus her income. Her business income is important to help support her husband and children.\r\n\r\nIt is very common in Lebanon to find small supermarkets  selling perishable and non-perishable goods. As members of the communities themselves, store owners have a deep understanding of local consumer needs and can offer products that meet local demand. The strong network of community relationships is an important component of life in Lebanon, especially in smaller towns and villages.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

farming. With this genre of business, it has always been an assured flood tide of financial success whether in the short term or in the long term. Even in the event of drought or famine, many farmers have banked on their reserves to make ends meet. It is therefore surprising to see a person dispense with this kind of lucrative venture. \r\n\r\n45-year-old K. Efulansi decided to go against this grain and made her farming business a subsidiary business 30 years ago. Her deduction was that she would be able to make more profit selling charcoal. She however still maintained her farming business though it now played second fiddle to charcoal sales. With hard work and determination, this married mother of 4 school-going children has achieved her goal. \r\n\r\nIn Luleeka, Lugazi where she operates, she has carved out a reliable niche for her business. This explains why her business is still going strong notwithstanding the competition she faces. In a month, she makes profits to the tune of 100,000 shillings. With this loan, she wants to buy more bags of charcoal for resale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":574958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":" purchase more bags of charcoal for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Efulansi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalongo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ritah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Charles ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3750000,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":234375},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":234375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":234375,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235860.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689505,"comment":null},{"amount":319.81,"local_amount":715997,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":720536.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903672,"comment":null},{"amount":415.45,"local_amount":930104,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":936000.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297143,"comment":null},{"amount":399.66,"local_amount":894758,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":900430.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467418,"comment":null},{"amount":435.39,"local_amount":974766,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":980946.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605508,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T06:00:03Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218278,"name":"Jackline Kemuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackline Kemuma K. is 32 years old and a single mother of two children.

Kiva borrower is a 25-year-old single man living with his mother and one brother in Lebanon. This young man decided in 2008 to start his own business by providing Internet connections to his town and its surroundings. He has been involved in this type of occupation for the past four years.\r\n\r\nDespite his young age, he is taking care of his family with his business income. His story illustrates the day-to-day challenges many people are facing in trying to take care of household expenses, sick and aging family members, and at the same time run a business. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase an Internet network in order to expand his business. This type of business is very common in Lebanon.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

He has been working as a teacher since 2005 in a private school in his town. In addition, he works as a private teacher where he receives students in his home where he has prepared a special room for this purpose. He cooperates with his wife to satisfy their needs and they are thankful for their business income. Since he is planning to further developing his home business he is requesting to borrow $600 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a computer in order to facilitate his teaching preparation and to conduct more research to help his students.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

In 2007 he opened a car spare parts shop as his own business. His father takes care of the family expenses but the borrower is trying to help him with his business income as the majority of Lebanese children do.  \r\n\r\nDespite his young age, he was able during this short period in the field to build up a good business reputation and he is thankful for his decision. He is requesting to borrow US$ 1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy more spare parts and enlarge his shop to meet the requirements of his customers and make a good income for his family. He plans to open a bigger store to sell spare parts and  one day, he would like to  open a commercial center.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Toda esta habilidad emprendedora surgi\u00f3 porque es el hijo mayor de una familia y la falta de su pap\u00e1 hizo que trabajara  desde muy joven  y se hiciera  responsable para poder ayudar a su mam\u00e1. \nDesde el a\u00f1o 2002 cre\u00f3 su propia alternativas de ingresos; posteriormente  inici\u00f3 con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organizaci\u00f3n que le ha suministrado 3 cr\u00e9ditos que le han permitido multiplicar su capital de trabajo y las utilidades le han servido para sostener los gastos del hogar, comprar muebles, electrodom\u00e9sticos, mejorar su vivienda la que inicialmente fue un lote que compr\u00f3, y que poco a poco ha ido construyendo con sus ahorros y con mucho esfuerzo. En la actualidad solicita un credikiva por valor de $1.300.000 para comprar planes de minutos m\u00e1s extensos pues su mercado se ha aumentado y no son suficientes los que tienen, para comprar C.D y MP3 para la venta. \nSu meta es crecer como persona y adicionar a su negocio computadores.Aunque sabe que su principal desaf\u00edo es el m\u00ednimo capital con el cual trabaja, tambi\u00e9n tiene otros desaf\u00edos como el de ayudar a su hija a que termine sus estudios universitarios, pues en el momento est\u00e1 en octavo semestre de Ingenier\u00eda de sistemas.\nEst\u00e1 muy contento con el entorno que rodea a su negocio porque all\u00ed se ha hecho muy conocido y esta rodeado de vecinos tranquilos y de convivencia pacifica.\n","en":"Roberto V\u00e1squez, 56, lives in Soledad\u2019s La Central neighborhood with his wife and five children who are between 22 and 35 years of age.  His business is a telephone call center but he also sells candy and cookies.  In addition, he has a stand in downtown Barranquilla where he sells CDs and cell phone accessories.\r\n\r\nHe began his business when he recognized the need that existed in his area.  He used to sell lottery tickets and acquired an important customer base that way.  He had a sales team for over 30 years.\r\n\r\nRoberto is from Carmen de Bol\u00edvar where he used to be an employee until he started to work for himself.  All of this business ability arose because he is the first-born son of a family and the absence of his father required him to start working from a very early age; he needed to be responsible in order to help his mother.\r\n\r\nSince 2002 he created his own way of earning an income.  Later, he started collaborating with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which has granted him 3 loans to date that have made it possible for him to increase his working capital and profits that have helped him meet household expenses, buy furniture, home appliances and make home improvements (which started out as an empty lot he bought and gradually has been using savings and much effort to build his home).\r\n\r\nHe is now asking for a Kiva loan in the amount of #1.300.000 to buy calling plans with more minutes included because his market has grown and the ones he has are insufficient; he also wants to buy CDs and MP3s to sell.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to grow as a person and to add computers to his business.  Although he knows that his main challenge is the minimal capital he works with, he also has other challenges like helping his daughter finish her university education; she is currently in the 8th semester of Computer Sciences.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy with the location of his business because he is very well known there and surrounded by calm neighbors who like to get along with each other.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She lives in her own house, and what she desires most is to improve her quality of life. Margot is trying with all her effort to change her current standard of living. She continuously plants bananas and coffee, products which she sells at the market in the city of La Merced, since she obtains the best prices there. She enjoys protecting her crops from pests. She has done this work for 7 years, and she thinks the hardest part is taking her crops to the market where she sells them, since the sacks she carries are very heavy. With time, she hopes to improve her products and thus obtain better prices. This is her third loan with MFP, and she feels that this loan will be very beneficial to her in her growth as an agricultural producer. Within her communal bank, she is a very participative member with a strong sense of solidarity. With the 2500 Peruvian new soles she is requesting, she will buy more fertilizer to improve the soil in her cultivated fields.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":575105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margot ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":504.29,"local_amount":1400.81,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1423.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195477,"comment":null},{"amount":395.71,"local_amount":1099.19,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1117.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270323,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T16:55:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218351,"name":"Olga Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga es de 33 a\u00f1os de edad es unida con su pareja, tiene cuatro hijos dos varones y dos mujeres, se dedica a realizar costuras hace unos 3 a\u00f1os, solicita su tercer cr\u00e9dito para sufragar gastos pers\u00f3nale, la cual le viene ayudar a su familia, sus referencias personales indican que es una persona responsable y trabajadora, su cr\u00e9dito anterior lo pago puntualmente, con la de su esposo pagaran las cuotas mensuales.

At the same time, he also has a building business. \r\n\r\nMr. G. has been a shareholder-member of the savings institution in Yoff since April 2010. He has never had a loan from the institution.

S. is a 42 year old man who lives in a community called Santa Fe, in Los Chiles in the province of Alajuela; this community is known for its mountains and for being very close to the northern border of our country. The main economic activities there are livestock and arable farming, specifically growing grains, sugar cane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFor several years now, Paulo has been raising livestock. He sells his products in the local community, where people say they are very happy with the quality of the goods he sells, particularly the milk.\r\n\r\nHe is currently seeking a loan of  \u00a2619.000 colones ($1,200), to purchase grass seeds and improve conditions in the corral where he keeps his cows. This will help him improve his business and generate the income needed to build his own house.\r\n\r\nPaulo is a member of the Santa Fe Communal Bank, one of 100 such organisations EDESA runs in Costa rica. This will be his first loan and with it he hopes to improve himself personally and financially. He says that getting this loan is a great motivator for him and that he will work hard to ensure he can continue to access support and to become a successful micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<br

The main economic activities there are livestock and arable farming, specifically growing grains, sugar cane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFor several years, Santiago has worked as a labourer for a company that exports pineapples. However, his entrepreneurial spirit has led him to decide that he will start his own business, selling clothes from his home. This will enable him to increase his income and also spend more time with his family. \r\n\r\nHe needs the loan of \u00a2619.000 colones ($1,200) to buy all types of clothing that he will sell in the local community. He is sure that his business will be successful because there is no similar shop nearby.\r\n\r\nSantiago is a member of the Communal Bank of Santa Fe, one of 100 such organisations under the auspices of EDESA in Costa Rica. This is his first loan and with it he hopes to reach a new level of personal and financial success. He says that this loan is a great motivator and that he will work hard to ensure he can continue to access credit and to become a successful micro-entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":575206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing that he will sell from home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2010-07-28T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":619000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47909.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48547.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":49195.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49851.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50515.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51189.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51871.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":52563.47},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53264.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53974.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54694.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55423.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.26},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.04},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":619000,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":619200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172246254,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-30T17:46:19Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T08:36:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218397,"name":"Rub\u00e9n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A la vivienda de se\u00f1or Rub\u00e9n Mu\u00f1ez le est\u00e1 haciendo falta un cuarto al frente de su casa pero no cuenta con el dinero necesario para comprar el material y pagarle a la persona que se encargara de realizar la mejora.\nEs por eso que esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito y empezar la construcci\u00f3n de un cuarto con el cual planea poner un negocio de venta de abarrotes.\nPlanea pagar el pr\u00e9stamo con una parte del sueldo que recibe de su trabajo en una agencia aduanal. \n","en":"The home that Rub\u00e9n Mu\u00f1ez is building for himself needs an additional room at the front.

William is always busy, organizing his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast and then feeds his chickens and pigs. He then switches gears, taking on the work in the fields.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers. Specifically, William will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials\/ingredients necessary to the production of chili peppers. All labour and transportation tasks will be carried out by William and his family.\r\n\r\nWilliam dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year. William\u2019s goals are to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation, and offer a better standard of living to his family.\r\n\r\nA major difficulty and limitation for William has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on his farm for everyone.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Los Chiles, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to William, his family and his community.

In addition, she has a home located on the Calle Santa Isabel of Barrio 6 de Agosto, in the Cuchilla area between the 4th and 5th ring.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":575242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"Roof construction for her billiard hall  \t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.1},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.22,"local_amount":76.22,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":76.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834687,"comment":null},{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":79.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172101066,"comment":null},{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":83.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393838,"comment":null},{"amount":85.72,"local_amount":85.72,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":85.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532249,"comment":null},{"amount":89.61,"local_amount":89.61,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":89.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668811,"comment":null},{"amount":92.69,"local_amount":92.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":92.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195831564,"comment":null},{"amount":0.41,"local_amount":0.41,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":0.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227024141,"comment":null},{"amount":193,"local_amount":193,"processed_date":"2011-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":193,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244545851,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T18:48:51Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218414,"name":"Ingris Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ingris Mercedes M. es una joven de  23 a\u00f1os, que  vive en el barrio la Esperanza de Malambo con su  hijo de 5 a\u00f1os, que depende totalmente de ella, porque  qued\u00f3 sin su c\u00f3nyuge y le toc\u00f3 asumir la responsabilidad de su hogar.\n\nDesde que su esposo enferm\u00f3 se dedic\u00f3 al negocio de distribuir conservas de leche, pl\u00e1tano y guayaba, consigui\u00f3 un cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo con el cual compr\u00f3 varias vitrinas peque\u00f1as las ubic\u00f3 en diversas tiendas y las surti\u00f3 de su exquisitos dulces de leche, pl\u00e1tano y guayaba que ella misma reempaca y exhibe en estos puntos comerciales.

She lives in the Esperanza de Malambo neighborhood with her 5 year old son that totally depends on her.  Because she has been left without a husband, she has had to take on all the household responsibilities.  \n\nSince her husband got sick she has been distributing dulce de leche (caramel sauce made from milk) and banana and guava preserves.  She obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which she bought some small display cases that she put in various shops.  She stocked them with her exquisite dulce de leche and banana and guava preserves that she repacks herself and displays in these shops. \n\nThis is her second loan.  She will use it to buy 100 boxes of preserves, 100 caramel pots, 200 boxes of gelatin and packaging supplies in order to distribute them.  As always, she will put them in different shops in Malambo.  She transports them with a motorcycle that she bought with the earnings that she saved.  This has helped her business and now she has more income, whereas before she had to spend money to rent one.  \n\nIngris Mar\u00eda heard of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo from her sister-in-law, who recommended them to her, as she is a long standing client of the Fundaci\u00f3n.  \n\nHer husband started this business more than 5 years ago, but has since died after a long illness.  Along with him she has been able to sustain her household and invest money into the business.  It has grown and helped her to increase her income.  It also allowed her to buy the motorcycle with which she can continue to open new markets further from her home.  She also bought a lot where she can build a small house.  \n\nHer biggest challenge is to steadily increase her sales because, during times like the rainy season, sales decrease.  For this reason she has started sending her products to Sabanagrande, Santo Tom\u00e1s and some municipalities in the department of Bol\u00edvar.  This has helped her to gain more than 800 steady customers, facilitate her business and generate new work.  \n\nThe loss of her husband 5 months ago is one of the biggest challenges the she has had to face.  This forced her to assume responsibility for their household.    Now, Ingris dreams of building a house in a good section of town, since currently, she lives in the Esperanza neighborhood where nothing is paved and the main means of transportation is the motocycle taxi.\n\n\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":569423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase 100 boxes of preserves, 100 caramel pots,  200 boxes of gelatin y packaging supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-28T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingris Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1700000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125368},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131235},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133422},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135646},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":137907},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140205},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":142542},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144918},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147333},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149789},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152285},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.21,"local_amount":125368,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127391.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117136,"comment":null},{"amount":71.41,"local_amount":131235,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":133353.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411006,"comment":null},{"amount":72.6,"local_amount":133422,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":135575.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550659,"comment":null},{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":135646,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":137835.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688265,"comment":null},{"amount":75.03,"local_amount":137907,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":140132.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427494,"comment":null},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":140205,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":142467.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000908,"comment":null},{"amount":77.56,"local_amount":142542,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":144842.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288916,"comment":null},{"amount":78.85,"local_amount":144918,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":147256.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230081,"comment":null},{"amount":331.24,"local_amount":608757,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":618582.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568959,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T04:41:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218415,"name":"Eulalia Florinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Lourdes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase breeding livestock. Lourdes is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the second loan taken out by Lourdes from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

He has loyal customers because of his deep knowledge of animal breeding which was passed on from his father who was also in the same trade.  He has been in this field for over ten years.\r\n\r\nKubra has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband so he can buy more cows and goats to sell.  Kubra is hopeful that this investment will prove beneficial for her husband and he will be able to do very well with it. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":575352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase animals to raise and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Borewala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.719444 70.997222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kubra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Parveen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166799625,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172069126,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360215,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182494894,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188629803,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372736,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790194,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201231972,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098418,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168821,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4090.9,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451565,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T01:47:53Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218475,"name":"Jeffrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeffrey S. is from the village of Manaoag.

Her husband was the only breadwinner of their family but now Raeesa\u2019s three sons have started managing the financial expenses of family. Her elder son sells copper wires which are good conductors of electricity and heat. This has become the family business as his two brothers also help with the business. In this way they generate income for the family. They earn approximately 30,000 Pakistan Rupees each month. \r\n\r\nRaeesa is a housewife. She spends her time in taking care of her children and doing household chores. She has applied for a loan from Asasah for her sons. With the loan amount they will buy the copper wires in large quantity and fulfill the orders of their customers. \r\n\r\nRaeesa is a second year member of Asasah.  She successfully repaid her first loan and has shown good credit behavior. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":575364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical Goods","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy copper wire for selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raeesa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4545.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166799626,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172069127,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360216,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182494895,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188629804,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372737,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790195,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201231973,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098419,"comment":null},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":4545.45,"processed_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168822,"comment":null},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":4545.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4658.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451566,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T14:31:36Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218488,"name":"Everlito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlito G. is from the village of Mozzozzin Norte.

The count of citizens that left the country is already reaching hundreds of thousands. This situation is explained by very low living standards, absence of jobs and possibilities. Some time ago our country was known as another Switzerland, but now it cannot hold itself up to this honorable title. However, the common folk continues to live and relive its governments which come and go one after another.\r\n\r\nShairbubu Baydalitova is a leader of this group. She is 60 years old. Shairbubu has raised a son and a daughter. She is a widow and has lived with her son and daughter-in-law in the recent years. Shairbubu has an excellent apricot garden. She is receiving a pension in the amount of 2000 soms and takes care of the garden. Her daughter-in-law works as a teacher in school and receives a salary of 2000 soms, and her son works at the gas station. His salary is five thousand eight hundred soms. Shairbubu has used her very first loan to buy seedlings which she planted in the spring. Her risk was not in vain. At this time she has 370 trees in her garden. Shairbubu hopes to collect a good harvest from her garden. But before that she needs to take good care of the trees. She has come to apply for a loan for this reason. She will use the funds to buy a wire to install a fence for the garden.\r\n\r\nShairbubu's group partners are:\r\n\r\nRaisa K. is 48 years old. Raisa is divorced and has one daughter who is already married and lives at home. Raisa does internet marketing. She sells cosmetic products of Faberlik brand and has an income of 4000 soms. Raisa has come to ask for a loan for personal use. Very soon she will need to meet her son-in-law's parents and she needs to be prepared.\r\n\r\nAijamal S. is 30 years old. She is married and has a daughter who goes to kindergarten. Aijamal's husband is in the military. He is serving as a top sergeant and receives a salary of ten thousand soms. Aijamal also needs a loan as she needs to get ready to meet her parents-in-law.\r\n\r\nTatyana K. is 49 years old. Tatyana's husband works as an electrician and receives a salary in the amount of 5000 soms. Tatyana works as school teacher. She has come to ask for a loan because she needs funds to buy building materials to build a shed in the yard.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Bortnikoff, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":575406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy wire to install a fence","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-07-27T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shairbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aijamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiyana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12681},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13448},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13971},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14605},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15295}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":299.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":271.74,"local_amount":12681,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12759.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884444,"comment":null},{"amount":288.17,"local_amount":13448,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13531.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151572,"comment":null},{"amount":299.38,"local_amount":13971,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":14057.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446595,"comment":null},{"amount":312.96,"local_amount":14605,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14695.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585762,"comment":null},{"amount":327.75,"local_amount":15295,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15389.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721607,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T19:12:39Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218513,"name":"Shahnaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahnaz, 48 years old, is the wife of A.
