She earns a minimum of 450 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRiza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this she also earns additional income from rugs and accessories that she sells. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 250 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRiza hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

is Nelsa, 48, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines. She and her husband Rogelio, a messenger, have three children. She, together with her husband and children, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNelsa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages in small quantities to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this she also earns additional income from rugs and accessories that she sells. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNelsa hopes to be able to expand soon, and she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Her husband Rolando is the father of her three children. Together with her husband and children, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLourdes maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products of popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-payback credit term. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on for their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She makes a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 21, 000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more merchandise products to fill orders from her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLourdes hopes to be more successful on her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good future and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":874936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":" To pay for merchandise needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-22T04:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4345,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764658,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571779,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5793.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529329,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4345,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738546,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-23T11:42:59Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":337734,"name":"Arivnaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arivnaa is 30 years old and lives with her parents and son in a <i>ger<\/i> (a Mongolian yurt) in the Uvurhangai province of Mongolia.

Barbara is 20 years old and lives in the town of Natete in the Kampala North region of Uganda. For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her food stall, which sells snacks and other kinds of food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Barbara has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food for resale and will help Barbara generate greater profits and pay school fees for her brother. Barbara hopes that in the future she will be able to open her own hair salon. \r\n\r\nBarbara is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Barbara's future prospects by helping her to invest in her family's education.

","en":"Mykola is married and has a 5-month-old daughter.  He works as a taxi driver and provides transportation services in Ukraine.  After graduating from a university with a geophysicist specialty, Mykola could not find work in his field and decided to work as a taxi driver.  He has been in this business for four years.  His monthly income is 4000 hryvnia.  Besides taxi driver work, Mykola works as a mechanic of fourth class, specializing in operations and repairs of gas equipment at one of the plants in Ivano-Frankivsk.  His monthly income there is 1500 hryvnia.  Mykola needs a loan in the sum of 9000 hryvnia in order to buy gas equipment and convert his car to run on propane gas because natural gas has gone up in price in recent times.  Mykola's business is the only source of income for his family.  He hopes that his fueling expenses will drastically decrease after converting his car to run on propane gas, which will in-turn lead to an increased profit. \n\nNote: previously Mykola's vehicle was working on liquefied gas.  When he took his previous loan, he used the funds to re-equip his car to run on liquified gas. However, recently the price for liquified gas went up quite a bit, causing Mykola to request a new loan to re-equip his vehicle to run on compressed gas."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":383.33,"image":{"id":875258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

It consists of Senora Tomasa who with her loan is going to buy a gas griddle, meat, tortillas, plates and glasses; Senora Yolanda who will buy soft drinks by the case; Senora Maribel who is going to buy firewood by the truckload; Senora Cleotilde who is going to buy chicken by the kilo; Senora Cristina who is going to buy corn by the truckload. Senora Yolanda Cleof\u00e1s is 45 years old, married and has a 2 year old son. She studied until the thrid grade. She sells soft drinks, fruit juices and bottles of water. She started her business 3 years ago little by little. Her business is important because it provides her with an income with which to buy food. She feels proud of selling drinks and that she can trust her clients to come and pay her on Saturdays. She is planning on selling corn and firewood and is hoping to achieve this with this loan. She is happy with this loan as it will enable her to stock soft drinks of different flavours and bottles of purified water to provide her clients with a better service.

Sus sue\u00f1os o metas  en cuanto al negocio es  capitalizarlo para tener m\u00e1s productos y en cuanto a su hogar, es  mejorar su vivienda y que sus hijos terminen sus estudios de secundaria y contin\u00faen carreras universitarias. Mientras Rosiris trabaja para lograr sus sue\u00f1os, genera un Margen de Contribuci\u00f3n  de 45.9%, una  Rotaci\u00f3n de Inventarios de  15 d\u00edas y una  Rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar  de 1 d\u00eda, es decir todo lo que vende a cr\u00e9dito, se lo pagan al d\u00eda siguiente. Desde estos indicadores financieros proyectamos su crecimiento potencial y auguramos una inversi\u00f3n exitosa con su credikiva.\n\n","en":"Rosiris, 42, is a widow who lives in San Jacinto with her four children, ages six through 21.  Three of them study and the eldest works.  In a land where vertical weaving is an abundant craft, Rosiris earns a living making hammocks, bags and bands, which is a trade she learned as a family tradition.  When she became a widow she began to focus more on the activity.  During the day she makes hammocks and at night she makes bands to order earning 2,000 COP per band.  She makes a minimum of three per night. They live in their own house close to her mother and two siblings.  Her family is very supportive of Rosiris and ever since her husband passed away they have helped out raising the children.  And thankfully there is one son who works and contributes to the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is her first credikiva loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she plans to buy cotton yarn to increase production.  She is very sure that the investment will be successful because she is perfectly familiar with the business and has had loan experience.  She has always paid them back on time through her hammock production and she also has the support of her mother who helps her make the crafts.\r\n\r\nRosiris has received two loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in the past two years.  With them she has been able to buy materials to make hammocks and back-packs, as well as small animals such as pigs and hens.  When she finished paying back the Foundation she still had a couple of pigs and hens as a profit.  Her goal is to capitalize her business so she can add more products.  She also wants to improve her house and insure her children finish their secondary education and get a university degree.  While Rosiris works toward her goal, she generates a contribution margin of 45.9%, an inventory turnover of 15 days and an accounts receivable turnover of one day, so what she sells on credit is paid the next day.  These are the financial indicators that we have used to project growth potential and we forecast a successful investment with her credikiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":151.48,"image":{"id":866469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy cotton yarn to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-10-03T08:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosiris Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":550000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46902},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50563},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":51743},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52950},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54186},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55450},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56744},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58068},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59423},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":63971}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.71,"local_amount":46902,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50413.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614981,"comment":null},{"amount":29.88,"local_amount":50563,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-24T08:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":54348.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568918,"comment":null},{"amount":30.58,"local_amount":51743,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":55616.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780240,"comment":null},{"amount":31.29,"local_amount":52950,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56914.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188633,"comment":null},{"amount":32.02,"local_amount":54186,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58242.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-03T13:09:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":337947,"name":"Magaly Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Magaly de 50 a\u00f1os vive con su esposo en el barrio las Am\u00e9ricas al suroccidente de la ciudad y tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 21 a 26 a\u00f1os.

He decided to seek out better lifestyle opportunities in the city of Barranquill where he began selling fruit in the streets of some of the neighborhoods, and there he met his wife of 18 years.  She sells products by catalogue and generates an income to help cover household expenses.\r\n\r\nSince then Luis's business has expanded so when he was able to increase sales and gain an accredited customer base he established a stall in the center of town where he has been for 20 years.  Luis sells strawberries, pears, apples and grapes every day and on a cash basis.  He buys his produce, also in cash, three times a week.  He manages the business directly and attends to its customers which include employees from banks, supermarkets, local shops, etc.  \r\n\r\nHis strategic location is easily accesible because he is close to four banking institutions and over six shopping centers.  His competition comes mainly from the street vendors who also sell fruit.  His goal is to grow the business and insure that his cildren get a technical education that will help them take on the future.  Meanwhile, he and his wife work hard.

","en":"Zholdoshbek is a 41-year-old farmer, living with his family in the Zhergetal village (Northern Kyrgyzstan).  He is raising five school-age children: three sons and two daughters.  In search of sources of income for his family, Zholdoshbek started a business of fattening up and reselling livestock in 1993.  Starting with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS), Zholdoshbek was able to develop his farm to have a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).

and has two children.  In search of a consistent income for her children, Shakhlohon became involved in animal husbandry ten years ago.  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, she was able to develop her farm to yield a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS) and have four cows and two heifers today.
