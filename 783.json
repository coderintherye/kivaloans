She is a single mother with two children, Romina, 15 years old, and Camila, 9 years old. She has raised them alone since they were very young. She works hard day by day for them as she wants to offer them a better quality of life. Gemima's work consists in selling jellies, flans, rice puddings and other deserts which are enjoyed by her many customers. They come to her stall in a port close to the city. She has worked in this activity for six years and in this time she has learnt how to satisfy her customers. She enjoys her work a lot as she only works part time and the rest of the day she is able to be at home with her children. She has to support them as they are at an age when they need a mother's wise advice. \r\n\r\nWhen she started in this business she was only an assistant to someone and sometimes she had to work long hours to earn very little. Since then she decided to carry out this work alone and have a higher income. She hopes to continue growing in what she does and in the future be able to have another stall in a different part of the city.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 8th loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support which will allow her to be less worried and go ahead with her plans for her business.

The group members and the centre have been very supportive during centre meetings, which also gives her courage to carry out her activities.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase motor  spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntangang Mankon Bamenda NWR","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":"2012-02-11T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-12T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":23810},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":23800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-11T14:46:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390417,"name":"Evalyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evalyne, 31 years old, is married and the mother of one child.

James hopes that in the future he will be able to expand his business. \r\n\r\nJames is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP), which primarily serves small entrepreneurs like James who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more essential commodities such as sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"kibuli","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-02-11T01:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-12T01:50:09Z","loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-04T23:36:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390420,"name":"Urtnasan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Urtnasan lives with his wife and child in Central Mongolia.

is married with four children.  They live in a four-bedroom house with one person per room at Mbomasa, a quarter in Bamenda Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. He has faced challenges in life such as deaths, sickness and accidents of family members.\r\n\r\nHe joined GHAPE in 2005 and has taken and successfully managed and repaid his loans four times with no major difficulties .He has been investing  his loan in a corn mill, grazing of animals and farming of crops. Given a new loan, he will expand his activities. He will buy more cattle, hire a herder who will take care of the cattle and buy seedlings for his farm. He strongly believes his business will succeed because he has a large piece of land where his animals can graze, the dropping will be used as manure for the farm products and he will buy a good breed of cattle. From this activity, the community will benefit from the droppings and from the sale of food crops like cassava, corn and beans, which he will harvest from the farm and sell to them at moderate prices. He will make sure the crops are available at all times.\r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used for employment of more workers to work on the farm, for the education of his children, and for the addition of rooms to his house. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the low interest rate, the education they provide on loan management and marketing techniques given to him by GHAPE.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is a 59-year-old father of three children. He is living in Mantic Tangub City, Philippines. He has been sewing for 10 years and continues to do so today. Dresses are designed according to the customer's desired style, or sometimes he creates out of his own imagination.

She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 17,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusan dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 40,000 loan.

","en":"28-year-old Silvana is single and has a four-year-old daughter.  Every day she makes income from her recycling business which she set up in 2011.  As an industrial engineer, she used to work for a recycling company but she became sick.  She had to take sick leave and then leave her job.  As she had studied recycling during her time at University, and her dissertation was on this topic, when she became unemployed she decided to start buying recyclable material from big industries which she then sold on to recycling companies and companies that recycle cardboard, PVC, paper, plastics, etc.  Her current dream is to further grow her business and to build her mother a beautiful house.  She also dreams of giving her daughter the opportunity to enjoy a successful future.  Her medium-term goal is to buy machines so that she can process the material herself because her biggest challenge is the competition which creates a lot of pressure in the market in which she works.  While she works towards achieving this goal, Silvana's accounts receivable turnover period is one day and her stock turnover period is three days.  It is based on these financial indicators that she would like to grow her business.  This is why she has applied for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy raw materials such as cardboard, plastic and rope in larger quantities.  Her investment will be successful because she is negotiating at a good price.

It's not easy to find larger sizes locally, so she specially purchases clothing for people who need these sizes and brings the goods back to her town to sell. Mariya does not have competition in her market. There is a demand and clientele for the goods she sells. Mariya's shop is in a good location and she has been in business for five years. Currently, Mariya has 35,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in inventory. Her profit is 6,2000 hryvnias. Mariya needs a loan of 12,000 hryvnias to purchase quality goods in Chernovtsi and increase her working assets.

He has a construction business repairing and renovating homes, apartments, offices and other places. Roman started his business five years ago. Prior to this he worked as a security guard and then as a manager before deciding that he needed to go into business for himself. He acquired the minimum equipment needed and began working alone, then recruited 2-3 others to work with him. Currently he manages a team of workers who complete jobs under his direction. Roman requests a loan of 20,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) to purchase construction equipment, specifically two cement mixers. This equipment will help him complete jobs more quickly, increasing the income of his business. Roman is a caring family man, a good friend and a trusted partner to his clients.

He lives in Ica, Per\u00fa which is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours south of Lima, the capital of the country. Ica is known by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (the land of sun). It is known in Peru for having earthquakes often (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), it's production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps above all, for being the source of the traditional national drink of Peru, Pisco.\r\n\r\nIt is in this dry and hot climate that the house and business of the client is located. In his free time he enjoys listening to music. As Peru is known for having some of the most delicious food in the world, one of Miguel's favorite dishes is ceviche. Miguel Angel studied through the fifth year of secondary school, but he would have liked to continue studying to become a dentist. He is the father of two year old, who he adores greatly and who is his reason to live.     \r\n\r\nMiguel Angel makes a living selling house cleaning equipment and supplies.

She lives with her husband, to whom she has been married for 3 years. They have 3 children whom they are raising in their own home, located in Pampa Blanca. Her principal source of income is the sale of food to the nurses in their annex, who pay her for the food they receive during the day. In addition, she opened a grocery store 3 years ago, where she sells basic products to the residents of her zone. On his part, her husband works as a driver, carrying cargo in his parents' truck all over the country. \"Sometimes he is absent for a few days,\" she comments. For that reason, she has to manage their plantings of potatoes on inherited land, where she supervises the growing and then at harvest time she sells them in the capital of the country, where she takes advantage of her husband's work to transport them and obtain better earnings. Now she is thinking of moving her things to a secure room, since the earthquake that occurred a little while ago split the wall of the house, which she will pull down to build a more resistant one. This is her second loan from MFP, where she is hoping for a small loan so that she can complete her objectives. On the other hand, she promises again to make her payments. In addition, she is thankful to be part of her association (communal bank), because all the members are responsible and united.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is celebrated by Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\"  In Peru, it is known for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007, and 6.9 in 2011); its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives; and perhaps especially, as the source of the traditional national drink of Peru, pisco.\r\n\r\nThe home and business of the client is located in this warm and dry climate. In his free time, he likes to listen to music.

Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP), which primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Sarah who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":59.55,"image":{"id":1003560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy braids","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kireka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3475 32.649167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T02:30:04Z","loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.55,"local_amount":136112,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":137855.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264133286,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T11:22:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390852,"name":"Mahmudchon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 16 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0430\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442. \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044f. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443.

He is engaged in the greenhouse farming business and has eight large greenhouses.  His farm is big, but everything is always kept in order.  Every year, Alexander plants 12,000 tomato bushes of both high- and low-growing varieties in his greenhouses.  The part of his land on which he grows tomatoes is situated on the shore of a reservoir, which protects the plantings from morning frosts.  Alexander has been farming for 17 years now.  Every year he has expenses of up to 50,000 hriven (UAH) for seed and plastic film for the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAlexander is planning to invest the 20,000 hriven loan he receives through KIVA in the building of an additional greenhouse on a large piece of land that his family bought last year with the goal of enlarging the farm.  Alexander has future plans to put new greenhouses on the new piece of land, which is 0.87ha in size.
