He is a 29-year-old single father of a 6-year-old son who goes to school.  Manzur only finished 7th grade; he did not continue because of a lack of finances.  He lives in his own house, and he supports 3 relatives who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe never left Boane; he started his business and built his house here.  He is an employee of the company Mo\u00e7ambique \u2013 Farmas, and besides his job there he has had his own business for more than 4 years.  He has no employees but works with the help of his wife.  His best-selling product is beer, which earns him close to 6,500 meticales per month, which he uses for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe never took out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through his sister-in-law, who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his fourth loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticales, with which he intends to buy products (beer, soft drinks, wine and other products) to increase the amount of merchandise he has.  The earlier loans were for 3,200 meticales, 6,200 meticales, and 7,000 meticales, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out more loans.

V. was born in the district of Namaacha, Maputo province, in southern Mozambique.  She is 25 years old, married, and the mother of 3 children who are 10, 7, and 1 years old.  The two oldest go to school.  She only finished the 8th grade; she was not able to continue on due to an early pregnancy.  She lives in her own home with her family and does not support anybody else.\r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha for Boane with her parents when she was very young.  Later on, she married her husband and they decided to get their own place.  She has had her own business in Boane for more than 2 years.  She doesn't have any employees but her husband, who is an automotive electrician at a Petromoc service station, helps her out.  She earns about 4,000 MZN monthly, and with her husband's help with household expenses, is able to save some in her Millennium Bim bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has not had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through her mother, who works in the same area and is also a client of the institution.  This is Margarida's second loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction materials (cement, support beams, sand, zinc plates, etc.) in order to continue building her house.  The previous loan was for 9,250 MZN, for the same purpose.  She promises to  pay back the loan in a timely manner in order to be able to have access to others.  In the future, she would like to request more loans in order to continue with the construction of her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

He is 33 years old, is married, and is the father of four children of ages 9, 8, 6 and 4. Of these, the three eldest attend school. He himself completed 10th grade but did not continue because he lost his scholarship and he decided to begin working. He lives in his own home with his family and he also support his mother, sending her money to help with her expenses. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nHe left Maputo for the Boane district when he began working, and at this point he left by himself. Later, he set up his own business, which he has had for 17 years. He sells rice, flour, doughs, refreshments, and other items. He doesn't have any employees, but his wife helps him. He makes a monthly wage of about 7,000MT, which he uses to help pay for his expenses and also saves some money in his bank account. \r\n<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nHe has never taken a loan from another bank. He came to know Hluvuku through his friends who are also clients of the institution. This is his 7th loan in the amount of 25,000MT, which he will use to buy products (rice, flour, refreshments, sugar, oil, and others) to increase and diversify his merchandise. The previous loans were for 4,000MT, 7,500MT, 10,500MT, 13,600MT, 13,000MT, and 13,000MT, all for the same purpose. He plans to seek more loans to develop his business and he promises to properly repay the current loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is her sixth loan.

Aida B. is the leader of this group.  She is from the town of Balykchi.  At the age of 29, she has already lived through a lot: marriage, a harsh reality of wide-spread unemployment and a simplest need to survive in order to raise two children, who she has after her marriage.  Aida decided not to ask for help from her relatives and did not wait for anyone else\u2019s help.  Instead, she started diligently saving money in order to start her own business.  She was able to have some savings four years ago and started selling children\u2019s clothing at the market.  But not everything happened smoothly.  She encountered many obstacles.  Not having her own retail outlet was the biggest obstacle.  However, the desire to change her quality of life and provide the children with good nutrition, warm clothing and comfort at home, gave Aida additional tenacity and drive to achieve success.  And finally, it all happened.  Whereas her previous turnover was only five and a half thousand som ($125) while not owning a retail stand, now, with having the retail stand, her turnover increased to twenty-five thousand som ($550).  Her monthly income is twelve thousand som.  And while the children are growing up and going to kindergarten, Aida has lots of plans for the future.  The goal of this loan is putting money toward increasing the spring variety of children\u2019s clothing.  Aida wants to open her own store in the future.\r\n\r\nAida has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nJamal S. is twenty-nine years old.  She is married and has three children.  Her husband works at a spirit manufacturing plant and gets a good, average salary.  Jamal is a homemaker.  She requested this loan for consumer needs.\r\n\r\nZamira D. is fifty years old.  Her husband had to leave and go to Moscow for work.  Zamira has one daughter, who is currently attending a university.  Zamira sews traditional goods: blankets, pillows, and sells them.  She requested this loan in order to purchase sewing materials.\r\n\r\nAysha A. is forty-seven years old.  She has one fourteen-year-old son and a husband.  Her husband works as a machinist at the city water station.  Aysha helps her husband with livestock purchases.  The husband purchases the livestock, and Aysha takes care of it.  They decided to request a loan to purchase a cow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":500659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase spring variety of children\u2019s clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6652},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6970},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7303},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7653},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8019},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":151.52,"local_amount":6652,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6730.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989904,"comment":null},{"amount":158.76,"local_amount":6970,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7051.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715715,"comment":null},{"amount":166.35,"local_amount":7303,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7388.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748563,"comment":null},{"amount":174.31,"local_amount":7653,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7742.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931537,"comment":null},{"amount":182.66,"local_amount":8019,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8113.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670550,"comment":null},{"amount":191.4,"local_amount":8403,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884207,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T17:58:39Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182489,"name":"Chhuon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chhuon M. has been working in the ministry of the military since he was a single man.

She even saves some monthly through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe had a previous loan with the GUEGUE Credit Association, but did not continue with them for various reasons.  She found out about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who is also a client of the institution.  She is her 4th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy supplies (bundles of used clothing, hair products, shoes, etc.) in order to increase her stock.  The previous loans were for 9,000 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 13,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan in a timely manner so she can have access to others.  In the future, she would like to request more loans to use for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daily labor and harsh working conditions do not seem to be something to take pleasure from. However, the heroes of this story manage to enjoy their lives regardless of the working conditions, whether it is the weather or material capabilities. Nazgul is the leader of this group. She is 38 years old. Her husband works as a private builder. Nazgul has a seven-year-old son. He goes to school and studies in the first grade. Nazgul works as a nurse in the hospital. When she has free time, she sews national articles, usually made to order. She started sewing 10 years ago. She manufactured blankets and sold them in the market. Gradually she acquired customers and since then it has been her second occupation. That is how her $10 investment has turned into a permanent monthly $70 income. She advised a sister of hers to help her and now they work together, sharing the income. Thus, Nazgul was able to help her sister find an occupation and make her own living. However, Nazgul does not want to limit her opportunities and is now planning to start a new activity. She is thinking about starting cattle breeding. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase some sheep as well as fabric for manufacturing national articles. \r\n\r\nNazgul\u2019s partners are as follows: \r\n\r\nKuljan is 43. She is a widow and has a daughter. To make a living she works in a hospital as a hostess \u2013 sister. Kuljan needs a loan to buy a calf for breeding. \r\n\r\nAinash is 49. She is divorced and has a 23-year-old daughter. Ainash works as a junior nurse in the hospital. In addition, she and her colleague produce doctor\u2019s smocks. Ainash needs a loan to purchase materials for sewing.\r\n\r\nJypar is 43. Her husband is a welder. She has three children. All her children do not work. Jypar works as an attendant at the hospital. Jypar has decided to give a try at cattle breeding. She hopes to obtain this loan and buy a cow.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and Planet (taking care of the environment).

She and her family live in a village. Her husband works as a security guard for a private company in the capital. With regards to Elmira, she is a nurse in the resuscitation department of a hospital. Together with her husband, she has raised four children. Their eldest daughter is age 32, and their youngest daughter is only age 9. Elmira started to look for additional ways of earning money, and, four years ago, she decided to try raising livestock. Her home was suitable for undertaking this plan. She bought two calves and started feeding them. After successfully selling them, she was able to buy a two-chamber fridge and a kitchen suite. This activity of raising livestock brings her about 140 USD per month. Elmira has applied for this loan in order to buy a sewing machine for her daughters. That way, they can earn their own living by manufacturing national articles of clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nElmira has four partners in this group loan: \r\n<p>\r\nIndira is age 26. Her husband is a farmer. Indira is the mother of two little children. She is not working at the moment, as she is staying at home to take care of her kids. Elmira needs a loan to pay for her education by correspondence classes.\r\n<p>\r\nTolon is age 64. He is a welder and the father of three children. His wife works at an organization. Tolon used to be the head of an organization. However, after retirement he could not sit at home and do nothing, and he started offering welding services. Tolon needs a loan to invest it in trade.\r\n<p>\r\nKubanychbek is age 48. His wife is a librarian. Together, they have raised three children. Now, Kubanychbek is breeding livestock for sale. He hopes to obtain this loan in order to purchase more cattle.\r\n<p>\r\nPahtagul is a seamstress. She has two children. Her husband is a farmer and also keeps some cattle. Pahtagul has applied for this loan in order to purchase some sheep, as her husband already has some cows and foals.\r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

They stop noticing the interesting and wonderful world around them and start seeing their life in not so positive light.  This makes their conditions more difficult, and their life becomes bleaker.  The members of this group show a different attitude every day of their lives.  They try not to notice the harsh reality and meet all trials and obstacles with smiles on their faces and good mood.  And they are good at it.  Nargiza I. is the leader of this group.  She lives in the town of Karabalta, which is situated sixty kilometers away west of Bishkek.  Nargiza is twenty-four years old.  She is single.  Three years ago, her parents gave her a starting capital, and she started a retail business of selling women\u2019s and men\u2019s undergarments.  She received a lot of work and life experience during the three years of working at the market.  She learned how to provide good service to her customers and always be joyful.  During this time, Nargiza increased her monthly earnings to eleven thousand som ($250).  Considering that she originally invested twenty thousand ($450), her current income is over fifty percent of the initial investment.  Nargiza decided to request a loan because she wants to buy a new stock of merchandise in order to increase the variety of goods she sells.  She thinks that this will attract more customers.  Nargiza plans to purchase an apartment for herself in the future.\r\n\r\nNargiza has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nBaktybek Kodjegulov is twenty-eight years old.  He has two small daughters.  This is why his wife does not work and stays home with the children.  Baktybek wants to obtain a loan and revive a previously started business.  He wants to use the money to purchase goods of every-day demand.\r\n\r\nGulbahar S. is twenty-six years old.  Her husband is working in Russia, and Gulbahar is raising two children by herself.  Currently, she is involved in retail sales of purses and wallets.  She started this business with the help of her parents, who gave her the initial capital.

She used some of her savings to buy a sewing machine and began offering sewing services for local citizens.  She also started sewing bedding for sale.  Her business went uphill.  Using the profits from this business, Sonunbubu was able to buy a cow and household appliances for home.  Her current net profit is around three thousand som ($70).

When this stability is not achieved, they have to look for extra ways of providing it. This trend exactly applies to the heroine of our story. Guljan is the leader of this group.She is 35 years old. Her husband works in a weighing control post. They have two children. Both of their children go to school. Guljan stays at home and looks after the children. So, from the outside view, everything seems perfectly safe. However, the salary of her husband has never been sufficient to provide for the family. Therefore, Guljan decided to try raising cattle and selling milk. Prior to this, she and her husband used to work on the land. So, four years ago, they harvested the crop, sold it and bought a cow to keep. Now, selling milk brings them about $45 a month. As a result, their initial investment of $350 has been compensated during four years of selling milk. Now Guljan needs a loan as she wants to purchase two sheep to increase the total population and consequent sales. \r\n\r\nGuljan\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nRosa is 49. Her spouse works for a local municipality. He is a senior man of the village. Rosa is the mother of five children. She is engaged in raising and selling cattle and selling milk. Rosa hopes to obtain this loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nRyspek is 38. His wife stays at home. However, she has found a way of earning money by producing meat dumplings for sale. As to Ryspek, he helps his wife distribute the meat dumplings to the shops and brings the foodstuffs home. Ryspek has applied for this loan to buy some convenience goods for the home. \r\n\r\nAigul is 36. Her husband is a farmer and cattle breeder. Aigul is raising five children. She is temporarily not working as she has to look after the children. Aigul and her husband hope to obtain this loan to pay for the tuition of their daughter.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 P's concept: <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

Thanks for these experiences, a person does not expect gifts from fate, but instead starts making his own happiness.  Mairamkul D. is forty-six years old.  She raised three children and fulfilled her parental obligation.  The children are already grown.  Two daughters are already married and live separately.  Mairamkul\u2019s son does not yet work.  Her husband currently works as construction worker.  Mairamkul spent the last few years working at a local national drinks and milk manufacturing company, called \u201cMaksym.\u201d  Exactly one year ago, she started thinking about a supplemental source of income.  Besides, her work schedule at \u201cMaksym\u201d allowed for it.  She obtained a loan from \u201cMol Bulak Finance\u201d and started selling vegetables at the local market.  Mairamkul needed only one thousand som in order to start her retail business.  And now she receives one and a half thousand som per month from the sales of vegetables.  She hopes that she will obtain a loan this time.  Mairamkul plans to expand the variety of vegetables in order to increase her income and repair her house in the summer.  The preparations for the repairs started a long time ago, and this is why Mairamkul sincerely believes that everything will work out.\r\n\r\nMairamkul has four partners in this group:\r\n\r\nNurbek I. is twenty-six years old.  He is single and works as a security guard at the yarn processing factory in Tokmak.  Due to his low salary, Nurbek has been involved in livestock sales for seven years.  He hopes to obtain a loan and buy livestock.\r\n\r\nRustam M. is thirty-one years old.  He is divorced, but helps his ex-wife and daughter.  Rustam works as a security guard at a factory and also breeds chickens.  He hopes to obtain a loan and buy chickens.\r\n\r\nOlga I. is twenty-four years old.  She is married and has a daughter.  To help her husband support the family, Olga began sewing dresses at home and selling them.  The profit is small, but allows her to cover minor expenses.  Olga needs a loan to buy chickens.\r\n\r\nMaudjuda M. is fifty-three years old.  She is divorced and is a mother of two children.  Her son lives separately, and the daughter lives with Maudjuda.  Maudjuda works at a news stand and sells newspapers.  She hopes to obtain a loan to purchase goods for her stand.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":500704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To expand the variety of vegetables in order to increase income and repair house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmak","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mairamkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rustam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maujudova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6074},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6380},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6619},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6927}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140.17,"local_amount":6074,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6225.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989911,"comment":null},{"amount":147.23,"local_amount":6380,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715723,"comment":null},{"amount":152.75,"local_amount":6619,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6784.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748571,"comment":null},{"amount":159.85,"local_amount":6927,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7100.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931545,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-07T05:22:45Z","paid_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182521,"name":"Fummilayo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fummilayo sells crates of eggs to make a living.

Este negocio es de mucha ayuda para la econom\u00eda de su familia, ya que los ingresos que su esposo percibe como trabajador agr\u00edcola no son suficientes para soventar los gastos familiares. Por este motivo Mar\u00eda Magna se esfuerza diariamente para sacar adelante a su negocio. \n\nLas lluvias que se presentaron en el norte del Per\u00fa hace algunas semanas hicieron da\u00f1os en el techo de su vivienda, por ello Mar\u00eda Magna se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la compra de eternits para techar nuevamente su casa.\n\nMar\u00eda Magna es una mujer bastante responsable y trabajadora. Su mayor anhelo es ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales exitosos en el futuro. Ella ya ha trabajado anteriormente con nuestra Instituci\u00f3n y ha demostrado responsabilidad y puntualidad al momento de asumir sus cuotas.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Magna is 35 years old, married, and lives with her husband and her 3 children in the Licapa sector of Paij\u00e1n district, Ascope province, in the region of La Libertad.  That is 2 1\/2 hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nFor a year now she has sold alfalfa (used as forage for feeding animals).  She buys alfalfa from regional farmers then sells it to her customers in the El Hueco Market in the city of Paij\u00e1n.  The business is very helpful with her family economy, since her husband's income as an agricultural worker is insufficient to meet family expenses.  For this reason Mar\u00eda Magna works hard every day to advance her business.\r\n\r\nThe rains in the north of Peru during the last several weeks damaged the roof of their house.  For that reason, Mar\u00eda Magna found it necessary to approach Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1,000 new sols to buy fiber\/concrete roofing tiles to re-roof her house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magna is a very responsible and hard-working woman.

Now she requests a new loan to continue investing in her business, by purchasing new products that will allow her to increase her sales volume and improve the finances of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":500820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a greater inventory for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-03-08T17:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.66,"local_amount":1153.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1204.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604588,"comment":null},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":1069.08,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640060,"comment":null},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":1185.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1238.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821846,"comment":null},{"amount":114.52,"local_amount":2290.4,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2392.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561855,"comment":null},{"amount":53.86,"local_amount":1077.11,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1125.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204664,"comment":null},{"amount":54.48,"local_amount":1089.58,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330369,"comment":null},{"amount":51.18,"local_amount":1023.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465528,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":1111.12,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1160.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097684,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T01:42:47Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182586,"name":"Lizet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lizet vive con sus dos hijos en la zona de Achachicala de la ciudad de La Paz; trabaja como empleada en una empresa de costura.

He lives on the plateau of Diakhaye, a neighboring town to the village of Baye Laye Guediawaye. In May 2009 he joined the U-IMCEC savings bank in Baye Laye. Mr. D. has been carrying out his cabinet-making business since 1969. He puts his creations on display and works to order. It is a profession he has chosen out of love and one out of so many that he could have chosen. From a profitability point of view, his business is particularly interesting during the run up to festivals, because there are a lot of orders during this period. However, during the winter period wood is rare. Consequently he is applying for a loan of 500,000 francs which will be used to buy wood in order to make beds and other furniture that he will sell. The loan will allow him to increase both his work capacity and his profits. As such, he will be able to provide better for his needs and those of his family. He is married and has eight children, the ages of whom range from three to 30 years.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

As the income is not adequate to meet the family expenses, he also raises and sells small animals in the backyard of his house which he sells to businesspeople who periodically visit his area.\r\n<p>\r\nThe rains that come in the northern part of Peru caused one of the walls of his house to collapse several weeks ago, and because of this Gerado has seen the need to ask for the first time for a loan of 1500 PEN from Edpyme Alternativa which he plans to invest in the purchase of material to rebuild the wall.\r\n<p>\r\nGerardo is a very responsible man and worker.  His neighbors and acquaintances have a lot of esteem for him and consider him trustworthy, and say that he helps others when they need it.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by William Gray,

The majority of its population works in the sandblasting business, although they also work in other areas, meaning they must leave for their places of employment very early as transportation is very scarce in their area.  The group is formed of 8 members who form part of the board of directors.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Maria works selling cosmetics through a catalog.  She is a student at the univsersity and her desire is to graduate and be able to improve her quality of life.  With the loan, she will buy merchandise on sale to later sell for the original price.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Sandalio works in construction.  He is married and has small school-aged children.  He will invest the loan money in the purchase of construction materials and tools to use in his job.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Edwin works selling furniture at the 16 de Julio market.  He is married and his wife helps him sell furniture.  With the loan money, he will buy merchandise to have more furniture for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nOther group members include: Jesus, who is a mason, Ines, who works selling cosmetics, Ximena, who sells cell phones, Maria Isabel, who is a seamstress, and Mrs. Remedios, who does sandblasting at the Irpavi River.  The loan will be used to increase labor capital to improve their businesses.

She is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Ceprodel to purchase various bundles of second-hand clothing so she can offer a larger stock of products for adults as well as children. She started the business with the goal of increasing her income, and she started out selling small quantities of clothing only for adults and as demand increased she also increased her products. Yareysi has had the business approximately one year and tends to it every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and sometimes her sister helps her. Previously, Yareysi made a living as a hairstylist. She hopes that with the purchase of more second-hand clothing she can increase her sales and satisfy her customers' demand, and thus grow her business more.

Fabiola is a distinguished member of the group who is a single mother of one child.  She produces homemade bread and distributes some of it to nearby shops.  The rest of it is sold from the corner of her mother\u2019s house, where she resides for the moment.  Fabiola is a highly intelligent and capable person, but in order to generate extra income to support her child, she needs to enlarge her business.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy more supplies and a larger oven to help generate more income so that she can help her elderly mother and pay for her child\u2019s education.  \r\n\r\nThe remaining members have businesses selling hamburgers, food, cosmetics, fruit, or providing services such as welding and public transportation.  Competition in the marketplace is high and really difficult, especially in the food and cosmetics businesses in which there is little available operating capital.  This loan will be used to improve their businesses by purchasing supplies, merchandise, and equipment to make their work more efficient and help generate additional income to improve their families\u2019 quality of life and provide them with stable homes.  Most of the members have experience working in a Communal Bank setting because they have taken out loans with other institutions similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.

Competition among them is quite difficult, especially in food and cosmetics sales, since each one expects a good result from her daily sales.\r\n\r\nThey will use the funds to stock their stores, to buy more merchandise, and to offer better customer service so that their business will earn higher income in the future and they will have a better economic situation as a result.\r\n\r\nBecause this

","en":"The \u201cLas Bendecidas\u201d (The Blessed Ones) is represented by Amparo and made up of 14 members who are in their second loan cycle.  They have shown unity, responsibility and the desire to continue growing to get ahead and make more progress every day.\r\n\r\nAmparo C. P. (group president) has a cosmetics sales business.  Thanks to her efforts, she continues to move forward in her work day to day.  She has two children and is separated from her husband.  Because of this, she overcomes obstacles in order to get her children ahead in life.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a hard-working woman and has shown herself to be very responsible.  She lives under the anticretico modality (a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you) and dreams with having her own home for her and her two children.  Amparo is making a great effort to reach this goal.  She will use the funds as working capital to continue growing in her business.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are multifaceted; they enjoy work very much.  Some sell food; others sell groceries, chickens, soft-drinks and turnovers.  Some sell milk, others vegetables. Some sell maja blanco (a sweet).

G. is a 48-year-old married woman who lives in Nangka, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by running a rice retailing business.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Ricardo, is 51 years old and works driving a habal habal (a single motorcycle that is the only mode of transportation in most  mountainous areas). They have two children who are 20 and 21 years old.  One works as a delivery boy and the other helps her parents in their business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the rice retailing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $326 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRosemarie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her rice retailing business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is on her 15th cycle loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her rice retailing business. Rosemarie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She lives with her husband and 8-year-old granddaughter, for whom Maria is completely responsible. She sells clothing for children, women, and men and also sells shoes. She sells her products from her house and also sells them as walking vendor among her neighbors and people from other towns. She is seeking a loan through which she can buy more clothing in different styles and colors; in this way she can acquire a bigger clientele, and she will also buy more shoes. She does all this with the desire to see her business and also her family economy prosper, since her husband is an employee of a private business, but in spite of this, his earnings often aren't enough to cover all the expenses. For this reason, Maria has decided to apply for a loan at Integral, with the hope of being able to improve her business and pay for everything that is difficult for her husband.

Nieves has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nieves is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI.

Marites has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Marites is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Marites from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

M. is a 50-year-old married woman who lives in Brgy Alimango, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running her general store which has been in operation for over 5 years.\r\n\r\nElvira\u2019s 50-year-old husband, Henrico, is a tricycad driver.  They have 4 children aged between 12 \u2013 26 years old with some of them currently going to school and helping out in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nElvira joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by running the general store. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 3,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nElvira is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,000 was used for the operations of her general store which had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 10th loan the amount of Php 17,000, which she also intends to use on her general store. Elvira is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":500429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is a 52-year-old married woman who lives in Jingjang Village, Barangay Alimango, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s 48-year-old husband, Ronie, works in a sugarcane plantation. They have seven children, 14 to 32 years old, with some of them having their own families while the others are currently going to school and help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nGloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fishing and selling fish in her local community. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 3,000.\r\n\r\nGloria is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her fishing and fish-selling and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 15,000 as her 9th loan,  which she intends to use as an additional working capital and to buy fishing nets.\r\n\r\nGloria is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They have two children, 6 and 9 years old, who are currently going to school while helping their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nJenny joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 4,000.\r\n\r\nJenny is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 5,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 9,000 for her 4th loan, which she intends to use for her general store.\r\n\r\nJenny is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Niginamo is a small-scale entrepreneur from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She is married and the loving mother of three children, who are the reason for her daily fight for a better life. \r\n\r\nNiginamo sells women's clothing in the market. She is a very hard-working woman. She always achieves her goals and overcomes different challenges with natural optimism. She is requesting a loan of 800 USD to re-stock her inventory. She is hoping to purchase more merchandise at affordable wholesale prices for further retail sale. \r\n\r\nThe only dream of Niginamo is to ensure her children a good education and to make them happy. We believe Niginamo\u2019s integrity and the consistent growth of her venture in the past years can guarantee further stable expansion of her trade and timely loan repayment. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jeremiah has provided typesetting, laminating, binding, computer servicing, and photocopy services from his location in a busy town market at the city center for 2.5 years.

A  specialist in shoes since 1968, Mr. B. is a teacher of shoe-making at the Maurice De La Fosse high school in Dakar. He took up this profession out of love and believes that the protective element of shoes and their elegance are the most important aspects of his work. Concerned by the necessity to manage his affairs by himself, Mr. B. is planning to run a parallel activity by setting up his own workshop and making products (shoes, bags) to sell; he plans also to train young people who do not have the opportunity to go to school. Thus, in order to advance his work, Mr. B. would like a loan of 150,000 FCFA from his savings bank, Jammi Xaleyi, which belongs to U-IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual savings and loans institutions) in Thies. He is planning to buy basic materials for 55,000 FCFA, and the balance of 55,000 FCFA will be used to cover personal needs (to pay the electricity bill for his house, rent..). Finally in thanking his lenders in advance, Mr. B. thinks that the loan will allow him to settle his debts and  to create products (such as the bag in the photo, which he made himself) for sale. \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":501386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Get supplies of basic materials and pay expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-06T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aboubakrine Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.86,"local_amount":42857.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":44805.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759260,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790770,"comment":null},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971208,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708477,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922536,"comment":null},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-07T00:56:17Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182833,"name":"Mohamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamad is a 28-year-old married man with two young children.

They are all from Notto, a rural community in the Thi\u00e8s region. Because all five women sell vegetables at the grand market in Notto, they formed a group to better organize their business and help one another with work. They thus joined U-IMCEC Notto in 2009 to find the necessary finances for their trade. So, they are asking for a loan of 375,000 FCFA which they are going to split equally. \r\nThe president of Takku Liggueey, Mrs. Coumba S., is 31 years old. This married woman has been working in this trade for 15 years. She says she knows the environment and its components thanks to the market gardeners. With her part of the loan, she counts on strengthening her work like her other colleagues. She intends to buy vegetables like carrots, sprouts, eggplant and cassava. Finally, Mrs. Coumba S., who chose this work for love, thinks the trade allows her to lighten her household load.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":501393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Stock up on merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-06T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nogaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":128672.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036679,"comment":null},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":128672.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759261,"comment":null},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":128672.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790771,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-07T01:06:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182836,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret W.

She has a business where she offers internet services, international calls, and photocopies.  Most of her customers are young students attending high schools and universities.

That is how she learned to manage it so well.\r\n\r\nDoris is single, and she does not have children.  She lives with her three siblings.  One of them is allergic.  The floor in her house is very rudimentary and in bad shape.  It emits a lot of dust even though it is constantly cleaned.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to improve the house\u2019s conditions, and that is why she is asking for her second loan for 2,300,000 pesos from the Mario Santo Domino Foundation.  She will buy construction materials to improve the floor and the bathroom, which is on the patio.  It is also in very bad shape.  At the same time, she want her house be more secure by putting up a wall.  That way she will have more control over the people who enter.  The patio is not sheltered from the neighbors.\r\n\r\nMrs. Guzm\u00e1n is a very active woman.  She participates in the social pastoral community in the church.

 comenz\u00f3  su negocio con un peque\u00f1o capital que le quedo de un trabajo temporal en sus vacaciones de estudio;  con sus ganancias pag\u00f3 su colegio porque desde muy joven tenia negocios con sus compa\u00f1eras de clases.\nCuando se cas\u00f3 su esposo(a su lado en la fotografia) le recomendaba compa\u00f1eros de trabajo como clientes y una vez \u00e9l qued\u00f3 sin trabajo, tambi\u00e9n empez\u00f3 a comercializar con ella durante un a\u00f1o manteni\u00e9ndose  esta pareja de las ganancias producidas: ellos vend\u00edan  de puerta en puerta y de barrio en barrio, alli se dieron a conocer y ganaron muchos clientes ; cuando posteriormente los clientes aumentaron sus pedidos de mercanc\u00eda, ten\u00edan que esperar hasta recoger sus cuentas por cobrar para responderles, as\u00ed muchas veces dejaron de ser oportunos y por eso recurrieron a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo buscando recursos para financiarse.  Hoy su esposo trabaja de mensajero  en una empresa, pero tambi\u00e9n gestiona la venta de mercanc\u00eda que Karen vende entre sus compa\u00f1eros de trabajo, ayud\u00e1ndola  a conseguir mucha clientela de sus conocidos.  Karen ha recibido 2 cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n en la l\u00ednea de capital de trabajo, con ellos ha podido aumentar sus utilidades porque tiene m\u00e1s venta debido a que con este dinero pudo comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda y hacer una oferta  diversificada; en la actualidad  solicita su tercer cr\u00e9dito por valor de $ 2.200.000 para comprar ropa, calzado e interiores para damas caballeros y ni\u00f1os, tendidos para camas, para lo cual viajar\u00e1 a  Barranquilla, ciudad a dos horas de Cartagena, porque incluyendo transporte su mercanc\u00eda  sale a un mejor costo y puede venderla a un precio adecuado entre sus clientes.\nCon su  negocio Karen se siente \u00fatil para los planes futuros que tienen ella y su esposo, porque sabe que pude lograr el sue\u00f1o de adquirir su vivienda propia y  piensa que puede tambi\u00e9n tener un local al lado de su casa. Su gran desaf\u00edo es terminar los estudios  y con su esposo tener un  gran almac\u00e9n de ropa y brindar a los hijos que planean,  un futuro prometedor.\nKaren se siente contenta, vive en un barrio que fue producto de invasi\u00f3n pero entre todos los vecinos  se organizaron y lograron  acceder a todos los servicios p\u00fablicos y especialmente a la pavimentaci\u00f3n de sus calles que hace f\u00e1cil el acceso a su negocio.\n\n","en":"Karen Bar\u00f3n B., age 26, lives in the Altos de San Isidro neighborhood of the city of Cartagena de Indias, within the municipality of Bol\u00edvar.  She began her business with a small amount of capital that she obtained from temporary work during school vacations.  She also paid high school fees with her earnings because, beginning when she was very young, she did business with her classmates.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she married her husband (standing next to her in the photo) he sent friends from his job to her as customers.  Once, when he became unemployed, he began working with her for a year, and the couple continued to produce profits.  They were selling from door-to-door and neighborhood-to-neighborhood, and they say they got to know and win over many customers.\r\n<p>\r\nLater, when customers increased their orders for merchandise they had to wait until they had collected on their accounts in order to fill them.  As a result, many times they lost opportunities.  Because of this, they resorted to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, looking for resources to finance themselves.  Today, her husband works as a messenger in a business, but he also tries to sell Karen's merchandise to his fellow employees, helping her to get more business from among his acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren has received two loans from Fundaci\u00f3n for working capital.  With these she was able to increase her earnings because she had more sales due to the fact that she was able to buy more merchandise and offer greater diversity.  Currently, she is applying for her third loan for 2,200,000 Columbian pesos in order to purchase clothing, footwear, and underwear for ladies, gentlemen and children.  For these she will travel to Barranquilla, a city two hours from Cartagena, because, even including transportation, she can obtain her merchandise at a better price there and can sell it at a good price to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her business Karen feels good about the future plans that she and her husband have because she knows that they can succeed in their dream of acquiring their own home, and she thinks that she can also have a shop next to their house.  Her great challenge is to finish her schooling and with her husband have a large clothing store and offer the children they plan to have a promising future.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren feels contented.  She lives in a neighborhood that was informally settled but all the neighbors organized themselves and succeeded in obtaining public services and especially the paving of their streets, which makes access to her business easy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

The most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning.\r\n\r\nHassan is special in his work because he is known for his good and tasty mankoucheh. He does chicken, meat, escalope and all types of other sandwiches. When he first started his business, he passed through some financial issues, so Hassan requested a loan in order to purchase a refrigerator for his work.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Hassan has requested a loan.

It is a group made up of 4 women with Madam Astou S. as president. Madam Astou S. is 39 years old, married and the mother of 2 children who are 17 and 3 years of age. She is a trader and runs a vegetables business on a table and various food products in the Notto market, a rural community located in the district of Thies.

He is in the transportation business; he has a taxi.  He has been in this business for 13 years.  Seven years ago he got his own taxi with five years of savings.  This has given him greater economic stability because now the earnings stay with him.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan to buy some things for his vehicle because it needs some repairs.  He points out that the vehicle is in very good condition, but he wants to improve it.  Like everyone else in the transportation sector, he is confronted with the challenge of maintaining his prices and earnings amid the great instability of gas prices.  This makes the price of basic needs more expensive everyday.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a taxi business with at least five vehicles.

She sells typical Ecuadorean dishes like:  rice and beans, guatita (stewed beef tripe in peanut sauce), caldo de bola (green plantain dumpling soup), caldo de pata (a broth containing chunks of boiled cow hooves, considered a delicacy by locals and believed by hopeful men to increase virility), etc.\r\n\r\nShe will use the funds to buy meats, rice and vegetables for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to have many more customers and to provide better service to them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":497887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"For rice, meats and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.68,"local_amount":30.68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945770,"comment":null},{"amount":31.95,"local_amount":31.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674131,"comment":null},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":32.88,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":32.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708292,"comment":null},{"amount":33.6,"local_amount":33.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":33.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891489,"comment":null},{"amount":34.51,"local_amount":34.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":34.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631739,"comment":null},{"amount":36.38,"local_amount":36.38,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":36.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845625,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-05T20:52:05Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":182927,"name":"Renovacion 2-5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sujeiri, 29, is a borrower who lives in Samana, Dominican Republic.

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Sujeiri runs a successful business running a small eatery. With this loan, Sujeiri plans to purchase more food including rice, beans, and sugar.\r\n \r\nThis is Sujeiri\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve life for her family. With her profits, Sujeiri hopes to purchase equipment so that she can also start baking cakes. She will also use her profits to purchase school supplies for her daughter, including a backpack, notebooks, and pencils. Sujeiri is currently studying as well, and her loans have provided her business with the profits that will get her through school. In the future, Sujeiri hopes to build a house of her own that she can pass along to her family.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Gregoria maintains the business to this day.  She is asking for a loan so that she can purchase the ingredients she needs in order to sell her food.  She is requesting this loan because she invested her earnings from her business when she began selling groceries, since the only store in her town is very far away.  She therefore saw the business opportunity and started up her store.\r\n\r\n     When she started her grocery store she was left without money to invest in her food sales, and that is why she is requesting the loan.\r\n\r\n     Gollita dreams of turning her land into an animal farm.\r\n\r\n     Gollita and the others are greatly benefiting from the loan, which they will use to purchase more utensils, livestock products, and vegetables, etc.  They are very pleased to be receiving economic help from Fundacion Realidad and Kiva for the first time.

They give her a certain quantity of clothing to decorate with different and novel designs.  That way she makes them more striking.\r\n\r\nAna really likes her work because it allows her to use her creativity and her good taste.  The difficult part stems from having to have very good eyesight in order to thread the beads to decorate the clothing.  They are very small, and you need to be very skillful when it is time to work.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she has demonstrated herself to be very punctual in making all of her payments.
