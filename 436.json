Unfortunately, in 1964, when Ainagul was one year old, her parents died in a car accident and Ainagul grew up at her grandmother\u2019s house, helping her in the household: she milked cows and pastured the cattle.\n\nFrom her childhood, Ainagul was eager to study and, after graduating from secondary school, she intended to pursue her studies through higher education. However, when Ainagul was 23, she was given into marriage.\n\nAinagul and her husband moved to the capital, Bishkek, where she graduated from Bishkek Humanities University with a degree with honors. Ainagul and her husband returned to the south of the country where Ainagul got a job as a researcher at Osh State University. In 1996, Ainagul divorced her husband. Some years later, Ainagul, being a very whole-hearted and persistent woman, adopted two little girls, who are presently 8 and 11 years old.\n\nIn 2004, Ainagul and her daughters moved to Belovodskoe village near the capital. It was the beginning of a new life which led Ainagul to start up her business. With an investment of only 6,000 Kyrgyz Soms, Ainagul started to sell foodstuffs at a local market in 2006. After four years, she already owns her own little shop.  Recently, she also bought two milk cows and began cattle-breeding.\n\nAinagul will use this loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Soms to further broaden the range of the food products in her shop and to buy one more cow. With the revenues, she plans to renovate her shop and to give a good education to her daughters.

Valencia is 39 years old and lives in the Villa del Carmen neighborhood, within the Soledad Municipality in the Atlantic Department  with her husband and her 3 children, between ages 10 and 15.  She has a general store that sells a little bit of everything, from pencils to accessories, perfumes and other items.  It's a family business that started because she needed to make important contributions toward supporting her household and also to fulfill her community's needs.  While her shop sells all sorts of products, the most useful items are the school and general stationary supplies; taking advantage of the fact that her business is next to a school.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second credit with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Since her first credit, she has noticed an increase in sales and also a wider profit gap from being able to make her stock purchases in cash with her credit.  It worked like a low cost work capital.  Now, with her Kiva credit, she is going to stock her shop with pencils, pens, notebooks, overalls, blouses, bracelets, earrings, perfume and cologne.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to earn a University degree and for her business to be known not only in her neighborhood but in the entire area.  As such, her greatest challenge is to make a name for her business in the sector, taking advantage of the fact that she lives in a neighborhood where the availability of inexpensive merchandise is in high demand and this is exactly what she is commercializing off of with her general store.   \r\n\r\n      \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva

They are located in the Tepexco community in the state of Puebla, Mexico.  The group is composed of 5 members that know each other as neighbors.  This is their first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  One of the group members is Se\u00f1ora Ivet V. S., who is 28 years old and is studying to become a computer technician.  She has 2 children, 1 boy and 1 girl.  Benito is 4 years old and is in Kindergarten while Azul Isabel is 8 months old.  Se\u00f1ora Ivet works selling women denim trousers and needs a loan to purchase more.  She lives with her partner, Se\u00f1or Herminio, who works in the fields and is paid minimum wage.  As such, she saw a need to begin this business, starting it over 3 years ago, when her friend's brother gave her some merchandise to begin selling and paid her little by little.  She operates her business out of her house in Tepexco and attends 5 to 15 clients a day.  Normally, they are young women that visit her business and Se\u00f1ora Ivet is always nice, cordial, and attends to them personally so that they return for more.  Her business is important because it adds to her household's income.  It provides towards her family's groceries and also allows her to care for her children.  Her dream is to continue to work to increase her earnings in order to be able to provide her children with a better life, expand her business by eventually selling women's bathing suits and underwear, and invite more people to join the group to obtain more loans.  \r\n\r\nThe challenges that she faces are her business' high bills.  Sometimes there are losses due to trousers coming out badly or defected.  Also, there is a lot of competition because various people sell the same products as she does.  Tepexco is a very hot place with hills.  Some of the people have animals, like horses and donkeys that they use to work or to get to their jobs or their houses.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Se\u00f1ora Ivet V. S., who, with her loan, is going to purchase women trousers at wholesale with which to stock her business.  Se\u00f1ora Maria del Rosario Guti\u00e9rrez C. is going to purchase fertilizer in bulk for her sorghum cultivation and to resell.  Se\u00f1ora Delia T. M. is going to purchase clothing, such as trousers for women, men, and children, skirts, blouses, underwear, shirts, etc, with which to stock her business.  Se\u00f1ora Ana Maria C. M. is going to purchase food for her pigs and baby pigs.  She is also going to purchase tomatoes, dried chiles, cheese, etc. in order to prepare her antojitos Mexicanos (typical Mexican snacks).  Se\u00f1ora Irene B. R. is going to pay for the initial fee and the catalogs to start selling nutritional packets for her nutrition club.  Se\u00f1ora Ivet would like to say the following to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"I hope that you continue to increase your loans because they help us uplift our businesses.

Many years ago, he lived in the city of Urubamba, where he had a hardware store. He had to close it because there was a lot of competition and he did not have many customers. \r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, Oscar moved to Ollantaytambo, where he had some friends and distant family members who encouraged him to open a store. He used the money from the liquidation of his hardware store to open a new store in the city of Ollantaytambo, where he sells paint, cement, nails, metal sheets, sandpaper, and much more. He has operated this business for ten years, and it is going very well for him, thanks to the dedication he puts into the business. With the benefits he obtains from his work, he has helped his three children get ahead. \r\n\r\nOscar is a responsible and hard-working father who presents an image of experience and professionalism. A regular flow of customers visits his store, but his sales are low in the month of March, due to the rains that fall in the city. Oscar belongs to the communal bank called \u201cLa Amistad de Ollantaytambo\u201d [\"The Friendship of Ollantaytambo\"], and he is one of the founders. With his next loan, Oscar hopes to receive $300, and he would like to improve his hardware store. He wants to buy energy-saving lightbulbs, nails and electrical accessories.

The vendors of the market \"Virgin of Ollantaytambo\" used to sell their merchandise door to door and around the city, since there was no market nor any stalls from which they could operate.   Today, each vendor counts on his own stand, Francisca as well.  From her stand, Francisca sells food, snacks and grocery items.  She also sells handicrafts from the group of artists called \"Senor de Choue Quilca\".   You will find Francisca at her stand 3 times a week from 8 in the morning until 11 in the morning.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francisco exudes the qualities of a responsible and friendly person.  A constant flow of tourists visit the market and the environment is very animated in the mornings when the tourists headed for Machu Picchu arrive.  Francisca sells quality handicrafts, for example table cloths, hats and embroidery.  She has been selling handicrafts for 15 years now and the business has gone well.   With her next loan, Francisco will receive $300US.  For the moment, her stand is modestly stocked with the merchandise she needs. She would like to use the money from this loan to puchase sodas, rice, sugar and other products.    <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francisco is a member of the communal bank \"La Amistad de Ollantaytambo\", or \"The Friendship of Ollantaytambo\" and she is one of the founders.  4 years ago a group of neighbors got together to form the communal bank and saw in the Association Arariwa an alternative way to get help with the loans.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":575635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase products for her small business such as sodas, rice, sugar and other ingredients she uses to prepare the snacks she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ollantaytambo - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.8,"local_amount":71.8,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":71.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166801198,"comment":null},{"amount":73.96,"local_amount":73.96,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":73.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070971,"comment":null},{"amount":76.17,"local_amount":76.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362268,"comment":null},{"amount":78.07,"local_amount":78.07,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":78.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497176,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T03:55:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218652,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is 50 years old and married with eight children who are between the ages of 8 and 24 years old.

Fifteen years ago, Doris opened a small inn, \u201cLa Casa de Doris\u201d [\"Doris's House\"] in her home, where she hosts foreign and domestic tourists. She and her husband Am\u00e9rico have one child. In her inn, Doris has single, double and family rooms, with prices ranging from 20 to 50 soles depending on the room. Every day of the week, 24 hours a day, she can be found in her inn, which is equipped with personal computers for Internet access, a kitchen, a waiting room, private bathrooms, etc. Doris projects an image of friendliness and cheerfulness. A steady flow of tourists stays at the inn during the months of May, June, July and August. \r\n\r\nWith her next loan, Doris hopes to receive $200 in US dollars. For the moment, her inn is modestly equipped with the most basic needs.

Several years ago, her husband passed away, and Justina was left to take care of her children alone.\r\n\r\nDeciding to continue with her life, Justina dedicated herself completely to her business.  She used her savings to start the restaurant, where she attends to approximately 20 customers everyday.  They can find her in her restaurant, which is equipped with chairs and tables, Monday through Saturday from 9 in the morning until quite late, or until the food runs out.  On Sundays she also sells special dishes like, for example, chicharr\u00f3n [fried pork rinds] and caldo D. cabeza [sheep's head soup].\r\n\r\nWith her next loan, Justina hopes to receive 500 new soles.

The communal bank's meetings are held every 30 days at the central office of the Arariwa Association. \r\n\r\nThe economic activities of some of the members are, for example, selling food, selling hens and guinea pigs, selling handicrafts, selling hay, selling stuffed peppers, and selling tamales. Other members proviD. services such as child care and manual labor. \r\n\r\nNeil is 24 years old and has one child. She was born in Cusipata district, located 45 minutes from the city of Cusco, and she currently lives in the city of Cusco. Since she was 11 years old, Neil has been surrounded by the business of selling tamales. Her sister-in-law Nayda went into the business of preparing tamales, and Neil helped her sell the tamales in the buses that travel from the city of Sicuani to Cusco. She got into the buses and asked the drivers if she could offer her tamales to the passengers. Several years ago, she got married and had to come live in the city of Cusco to be with her husband.\r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, she moved to Cusco. She used her savings to prepare tamales and sell them at the bus station in Cusco, where she gets on the buses and offers them to the travelers. She can be found at the terminal 7 days a week, from 5 in the morning until 6 in the evening, or until the tamales run out. She sells tamales in two varieties, sweet and savory, at a price of 0.50 soles each.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, Neil hopes to receive 1000 Peruvian soles. She would like to buy corn, corn husks, sugar, eggs, raisins and many more ingredients. At present, Neil is worried because the director of the bus terminal wants to evict her; he is requiring her to rent a sales stand, but she does not have enough money to rent one. Her dream is to open a small food store in her home, and she would like to become a microentrepreneur.                         \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4050,"image":{"id":575678,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buying corn, corn husks, sugar, eggs, raisins and many more supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ocongate - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neil Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Etelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leslie Hindira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11400,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2684.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2791.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2903.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3019.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":953.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":991.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1031.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1072.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":954.71,"local_amount":2687.32,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2692.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166801209,"comment":null},{"amount":992.91,"local_amount":2794.85,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070982,"comment":null},{"amount":1032.61,"local_amount":2906.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2911.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362279,"comment":null},{"amount":1069.77,"local_amount":3011.23,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3016.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497187,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T00:59:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218674,"name":"Mary Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Ann R. lives in the town of Surallah.

She has been very hardworking since she joined GHAPE as she explained how good it is for a woman to work for herself and care of the children. Her desire is to work for her children\u2019s education and pay for their apprenticeship. Also, she says she finds it very difficult to take care of her two children because for some months back she has been having some marital problems. Because of that, her husband has not been giving her food money for the family. With these difficulties, she looked for a place to get capital in order to do some buy and sell trade, which would give her income. With the inability to get investment capital, which could give her higher income to meet her children\u2019s needs and the family, she decided to join GHAPE in 2009, and since then she has successfully received and repaid one loan.\r\n\r\nWith the second loan she is requesting, she plans to buy 30 tins of potatoes for 50,000FCFA, 20 tins of beans for 50,000FCFA, vegetables for 10,000FCFA, and cocoyams for 5,000FCFA.  This investment will help people in her community because she will sell her goods to the public, which will reduce their cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nShe says that she will use the profit generated from this investment to help her husband pay tuition fees for her two children and take care of their health. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Her motivation comes from the difficulties she faced, especially the death of her mother, poor health, her inability to continue education and the destruction of her cassava farm by wild fire. As a consequence of all this, she was unable to educate her children even at primary school level.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by GHAPE borrowers she became a member of GHAPE and received her first loan of 40,000CFAF in 2009. Since then she has proven her ability to receive, invest and repay her loan. From previous loans she provided her community with food stuff like beans, corn and Irish potatoes. \r\nShe is proud of her achievements, especially her success in owning and managing her own business. With profits from these loans, she has been paying her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nWith a new loan, she plans to continue in the same line of business. She plans to buy twenty tins of beans for 50,000FCFA, fifteen tins of Irish potatoes for 20,000FCFA, six tins of corn for 15,000FCFA and vegetables for 10,000FCFA  She will provide food stuff to the community and the business will succeed since she has many customers.

She has faced so many challenges as a woman, like when the cold hands of death took her mother away when still very young and when she finds it difficult to single-handedly pay tuition fees and provide the basic needs for her children. This is the first time she has requested a loan from GHAPE. As she was unable to get investment capital that would help increase her income, she was motivated to request a loan from GHAPE. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she plans to buy three tins of beans seedlings for 195,500FCFA and she will use 30,500FCFA to pay for labor on her farm. She will pay for clearing, hoeing and planting.\r\n\r\nShe thinks the business will succeed because she has been doing this activity for a very long time, she has a plot of land on which to operate and, also, her community will provide a ready market for her beans when they are ready. The profit obtained from this investment will be used to pay tuition fees and cover the basic needs of her children.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

The inability for her to have business capital and to be with people motivated her to join GHAPE in 2009. This is the first loan she is requesting from GHAPE. \r\n\r\nShe knows she will succeed in her farming business because she knows all the farming techniques and her farm products are in very high demand in her community. Also, she will buy Irish potatoes in bulk in her area and resell in the urban areas of Bamenda and Yaound\u00e9, which will give her a high income.\r\n\r\nEsther F. plans to buy farmland for 30,000FCFA and to buy ten tins of Irish potatoes for 20,000FCFA. The profit obtained from this investment will be used to pay tuition fees for her children and basic needs. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Ram\u00edrez is a native of the state of Guerrero.  She is the president of the group \u201cLa Juquilita\u201d, and works selling shoes by catalog to support her family.  She has a 2\u00bd-year old child, is married and 26 years of age.  Her greatest dream is to grow her business, and she tells us that this latest loan will help finance the purchase of shoes.  She is thankful to the Foundation for the support of her business.  She says that she very much likes how the Foundation works, as well as her interest rate, the rewards and the personal treatment.  She also mentions that, hopefully, the Foundation will continue to help support her efforts for a long time so the group can grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation got its name due to the town\u2019s deep-rooted religious belief in the Virgin of Juquila.  There are 10 hard-working members in the group, and they are all grateful to the Foundation for its confidence and understanding.  The members are: Clara M. J., who sells chickens; Evangelista Hern\u00e1ndez M., who makes tamales, Yazm\u00edn Alicia R\u00edos Garc\u00eda, who sells clothing; Yanina M. J. and Maricruz A. C., who sell food; Gloria M.

K. is 32 and married with two children aged 14 and 10. In 2008, she established her poultry business. Working 6 days a week, 4 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received, and successfully repaid, 8 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to purchase chicks. In the future, Saraswati plans to send her children to private school. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, raising poultry for eggs and meat is a very profitable business. Kiva loans are used to purchase chicks, food, and necessary medicine to keep the chickens healthy. Once matured, the chickens are sold at small butcher shops or in the many open air markets throughout the valley. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

He sells in the same town from a place in his house.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy coffee and corn seeds to increase his business.  He thinks that the loan is an opportunity to get ahead.  He dreams of having the money to increase his production.  He faces challenges; which are the lack of money, the change of climate, pests, and illnesses.\r\n\r\nHe likes to play sports and work in the field.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

It is comprised of hard-working and enterprising people who always look for opportunities to get ahead.  With their daily effort they are looking to give their children a better future.  The communal bank\u2019s meetings are every 30 days.  They meet in Benedicta\u2019s house.  She is a member, and her house is located in the Compone community in Anta.  The Componte community is 45 minutes from the city of Cusco.  Most of the inhabitants work in agriculture and with livestock.\r\n\r\nBenedicta is 35 years old, and she has two children.  She was born in and lives in the Compone community in the Izcuchca district, Anta province.  Two years ago Benedicta opened a grocery store in her home, and she sold food to her neighbors.  She also sold corn, potatoes, \u201cchicha de jora\u201d (a traditional beverage of the area that is made of corn), yogurt, and cheese.  She took her products to the city of Cusco to sell.\r\n\r\nNow Benedicta has changed businesses.  She raises small animals like guinea pigs.  She used the small amount of capital that she had to prepare to raise animals and to build a small shed.  She started raising seven guinea pigs.  She currently has 15 guinea pigs.  The specialists in the Anta municipality are training her.\r\n\r\nThe next loan that Benedicta hopes to receive is for 1,000 soles.  At the present time the shed is modestly set up with the basic necessities.  She would like to use the money to plant grass on her farm, which is at the side of her house.  Grass is good food for the guinea pigs.

They have four children between the ages of 8 and 16.  Mar\u00eda has two businesses, one selling fish and the other selling general merchandise.  Both of these activities are her main sources of income.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa is a very organized woman.  She began selling fish with her husband when she was 16 years old.  Mar\u00eda worked as a street merchant, selling to employees who worked at an industrial park called PINZA that was located in her town.  At the time, she transported the fish in polystyrene coolers.  Her main customers were neighbors, relatives, and friends.  She even resorted to borrowing her mother-in-law\u2019s refrigerator.  As her family slowly grew, so did the number of other needs that she had to fulfill.  It was around that time that she talked with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo about applying for a loan.  In 2004, she received a loan from the organization in the amount of 900,000 COP which she used to boost her business.  Later she received another loan for 1,300,000 COP, and then a third loan for 1,500,000 COP, and finally an additional loan that was also worth 1,500,000 COP.  All of the funds were invested into her business with great discipline.  Using the earning she had saved, she was able to buy a plot of land and became eligible to apply for a new loan which she used to build her house.  Her housing loan has since been repaid completely.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan.  She will buy a refrigerator where she can store her fish when she is not working.  With the rest of the money, she will pay for merchandise that she has ordered and purchase a canoe since she belongs to a family of fishermen.  Her husband is a member of the Nuevo Amanecer fishing cooperative and fishes in the lagoon in Malambo, which is near where many businesses are located.  They have a canoe that is in disrepair, so they need another one.  At the moment, Mar\u00eda buys her fish from other fishermen and then sells it at a higher price.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince participating in the programs offered by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Mar\u00eda has been able to build up enough capital to continue her business and make improvements to her living conditions.  She dreams of finishing all of the adjustments she has to make for her family to live a healthy life and for her children to have a secure future.  Her greatest challenge occurs in winter when her fish sales decline because she does not go out to sell.  With her other business, she is able to sell different merchandise to the same customers who buy fish from her.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":575259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase a refrigerator for storing fish, a fishing canoe for her husband, and merchandise for her second business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-28T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria  Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112285},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115823},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117754},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":119716},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121712},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":123740},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125802},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127899},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130031},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":132198},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":134401},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138639}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":112285,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":114867.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117140,"comment":null},{"amount":128.46,"local_amount":233577,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":238949.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550663,"comment":null},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":119716,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":122469.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688269,"comment":null},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":121712,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":124511.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427498,"comment":null},{"amount":137.25,"local_amount":249542,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":255281.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288920,"comment":null},{"amount":288.49,"local_amount":524529,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":536593.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673198,"comment":null},{"amount":76.25,"local_amount":138639,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":141827.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325128,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T22:02:51Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218744,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio P.

Z., 52, is a hardworking man whose business is making breakfasts, lunches, pupusas (typical Central American food-cornmeal filled with cheese, or pork or beans) tortillas, and he also sells juices, fruit shakes and sodas.  Carlos lives in  Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n with his wife, their three children: 12, 13 and 7 - all students.  The business is located in Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n near the  Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as University.  The location is a great benefit because the majority of students like this type of business since food is offered at a lower price.  Also Carlos has many customers who are workers in different offices that are found nearby.  Despite  the fact that there is a lot of competition, he tries to make the best possible food so that he can always count on regular customers and that they will recommend him to others.  Carlos is a very responsible and friendly man who is dedicated to his work.  He is asking for the loan to have money to be able to buy a greater quantity of the necessary ingredients so that he can make more food, broaden his menu, and thus keep his customers satisfied and continue eating what he sells.  This is very important to him and to his family since the business is their only source of income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

The sweaters that she makes are very high quality, which is why she has loyal and stable customers who solicit her elaborate work on a regular basis. Sabina doesn't stop at weaving. She's always on the lookout for new business opportunities like, for example, selling breakfast foods in front of a university, which supplements her income.

Her business is making crafts such as hammocks, sandals, bags and anything that her natural creativity inspires.

This generated better conditions for the family such as education for her children, who are in college studying law and social sciences. It has also allowed her to improve her home that she built little by little with her husband. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with this organization and she will invest in in the purchase of materials to make crafts and sandals for which she has orders. \r\n\r\nShe faced her greatest challenge 10 years ago when her husband didn't have a stable job and the family lived on her modest income and hard work. Today all that has changed, the business is thriving and they live in a neighborhood surrounded by craft businesses. This competition motivates them daily.

N. is thirty-five years old, married and has four children aged between ten and two years old. His wife helps him in running the business and they hope to grow the business and create employment for people.\r\n\r\nHis business is located at Mikindani estate in Mombasa and it is well known by the name Liera Tailoring. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian Ocean's white beaches.\r\n\r\nSamuel makes clothes for men and women of all ages. He also makes school uniforms, something he has engaged in for the last ten years.

Her customers are mainly women.   \r\n\r\nShe has done this business for many years now and works seven days a week.  Her main business challenge is transportation from her home to the Kampala city shops.  She aspires to buy a plot of land and build a house for herself. She joined MCDT because of the low interest charged on loans.\r\n\r\nMadina resides in and rents a two-room house and the family has access to electricity and no piped water.  Her greatest expense in a month is rent for her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":576142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":" To buy more boxes of cosmetics, creams and weaves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17700},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":23600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.96},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":8.01,"local_amount":17800,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":17966.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159671479,"comment":null},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":70800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":71461.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166885146,"comment":null},{"amount":31.86,"local_amount":70900,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":71562.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172152404,"comment":null},{"amount":45.49,"local_amount":101050,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101994.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177447520,"comment":null},{"amount":107.82,"local_amount":239450,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":241688.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188722701,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-29T14:35:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:02:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":218860,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Joyce J. is currently in the business of selling maize flour, rice, beans and more at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of maize flour and rice to sell.  \r\n\r\nJoyce is 30 years old and is married.

B. is from the town of Trento. She is 42 years old. Lucina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Lucina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Lucina also raises pigs and chickens. She hopes that this new venture of hers will grow as well.\r\n\r\nLucina joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucina has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Lucina is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure, and livestock feed. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lucina from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

Daisy is a 28-year-old mother of one, operating a business selling soft drinks in Nawawojjollo, Lugazi. A friend helped her to start up in business after she prevailed upon her to dispense with the idea of depending wholly on her husband for everything.\r\n\r\nDaisy has been running her business for the last two years and, in a sense, has been successful in as far as making her business function well.

completing his university studies, started a business selling smoked fish such as herring and mackerel.\r\n\r\nUsing 50,000 francs of his scholarship money from when he was a student, he bought two boxes of smoked fish, rented a table, and started selling at the great market of Brazzaville. Oddly, smoked fish is typically sold only by women at this market. Being the only man involved in this activity, he got many customers. He was able to achieve sales of 80,000 to 100,000 francs per day as the people of Congo really appreciate this type of smoked fish, and because it is much more affordable and available to all segments of the population.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to buy 50 boxes of herring and 10 boxes of mackerel. He gets his stocks from the Beninese, who fish in Pointe-Noire, and each week he has to send money to get fish. Otherwise, he places orders at least twice a month.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, he plans to increase his stocks of smoked fish and become a supplier for the ladies who sell it at the market, while continuing with his own sales. He is very likable and everyone calls him \u201cpapa gentil\u201d (nice daddy).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

Kiva borrower is a 44-year-old married man with three school-age children. He has many years of experience working as a car electrician and car electronics seller. And in 2003, he opened his own shop in his town to earn his own profit. After opening his shop, he noticed that his family economic situation was improved and he\u2019s thankful for this.  \r\n\r\nHe has taken a first loan and he has been a reliable borrower, with on-time repayments throughout his loan cycle. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,500 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase more car electronics equipment in order to grow his business into other areas.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999.

In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers.

","en":"Adrienne K. is a 47 year-old retailer.  She is married and the mother of 4 children.  She has been in business from a young age, when she helped her mother with her sales.  She developed a liking for second-hand clothing and at the end of her junior high school studies, she also began to sell secondhand clothing.  Her daily sales are from 25,000 to 30,000 francs and she gets her supplies in the storehouses and department stores in the area  or from the wholesalers who go to buy in Matadi in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Once the loan is granted, she plans to expand her business by purchasing bundles of unused towels, sheets, bedspreads, curtains and robes.  Her sales strategy is very remarkable.   She has the unused sheets and towels washed and delivers sets of towels and bundles of sheets sorted by size and color to offices and homes.  She is thinking of opening one or more shops in various districts of Brazzaville. That will help her to save more and to provide for the education of her children so that they will be able to get a university education.  Very well known in the neighborhood, her husband is proud of her. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva

With all these difficulties she decided to look for a way to find this capital. She decided to join GHAPE. This is Margaret's first loan, and this loan will help provide capital, thus increase her income and the well-being of her family. \n\nWith the loan, Margaret plans to rent farmland for 25,000 FCFA, buy three tins of beans seedlings for 21,000 FCFA and 4,000 FCFA will be used to pay for labour that will assist her in the farm. She knows this business will succeed because she has been doing this activity for a very long time.\n\nWith the profits from this loan, Margaret will assist her husband to construct a house for the family. She will also pay tuition fees for her children and ensure that they are well prepared for school. She will also provide good food for her family.  Her training in business management that she received from GHAPE will help her to invest this loan in the most efficient and productive manner. \n \nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

is married with nine children and they live in Twalatwal, a neighborhood in Belo Sub-Division, Cameroon. Poverty has been the main cause of problems in her family. In order to solve some of these problems, she decided to became a GHAPE member. This is Regina's first loan. She is very interested in the activities of GHAPE.   \r\n\r\nThis loan will help her rent  farmland for 10,000 FCFA, buy Irish potato seedlings for 20,000 FCFA, and also buy bean seedlings for 20,000 FCFA. She knows this business will succeed because the land where she will carry out her farming is still very fertile and her community will provide a ready market for her farm produce when it is ready.  \r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Josephine F. will open a workshop for her daughter. She will also pay her children\u2019s and the children of her late sister's tuition fees and ensure that they are well prepared for school. Her training in business management that she received from GHAPE will help her to invest this loan in the most efficient and productive manner. \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

She has three children, who range from 7 to 21 years of age.  When she finished her training in the tailoring trade, her mother gave her a sewing machine as a gift.  She opened a workshop in 1996.  She has a strong customer base and has an average income of 45,000 to 50,000 francs CFA per day.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan that she plans on receiving, she is going to purchase some fabrics and <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth) to make camisoles, shirts, and women's outfits that she will sell to her customers.  Beyond this, there are special orders from customers she receives each day.  The difficulties she encounters involve the accumulation of orders, and the customers do not keep their appointments.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, she is thinking of opening a sewing school for re-integrating young mothers into the working world and for helping them to support themselves eventually.  She is also thinking of continuing with her design courses in order to be a designer and to put on fashion shows in the future.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Her daily income varies from 15,000 to 20,000 francs.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to boost her business by purchasing plastic items such as baskets, bowls, basins, bowls, buckets, as well as sweets (candy, cookies), hair extensions (pony, Afro, darling, x-pression, olive, English), underwear (slips, bras) and many other things.Her strategy is to set up an appealing display of her merchandise to attract customers, to give them a proper greeting, and to accumulate daily savings.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to open a big shop, get a piece of land, and provide good living conditions for her children. She is a good representation of the women in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

It is located in the community of Barrio Santiago, Acteopan, in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The group is made up of 5 members who know each other because they are neighbours. This is their first loan with Fundacion Realidad. \r\n     \r\nThe representative of the group is Miss Pompilia T. A., age 37, who studied until the 6th grade and obtained her primary certificate. She is single and has no children. She is a potter and needs a loan to purchase clay, firewood, lead, celite, and paint for decorating her pans, pots and jars of various sizes and models. From a very young age she has enjoyed helping her father with this work, and he taught her how to work with clay. She has been in this business for 15 years and her father, mother and brother are involved in the making of the products. Some will cut the clay, others will crush it and others put on the plaster, handles and edges of the pans, pots and jars. She considers her business to be important because it generates the  income for her household costs, food and savings to continue purchasing materials. This is a family business; generations of her family have worked in pottery. She takes great satisfaction in seeing her completed pans, pots and jars because they are very beautiful; and she gets great satisfaction when her customers say that they are beautiful. They bring their products to sell in the Ozumba plaza on Tuesdays, and also in Tonatico, in the state of Mexico. They have much competition since these are locations where much pottery is offered for sale. The good thing is that Pompilia already has customers who only buy from her because of her quality, good price and good service. Her earnings are used to purchase more clay and firewood, and she saves to cover her household costs.\r\n      \r\nBarrio Santiago, Acteopan, in the state of Puebla is a very beautiful village. There are trees and fields, and they sow sorghum, corn, and peanuts and use donkeys, horses and mules to work in the fields. They use yoked oxen to plough the land. There are paved roads, some with cobblestone and some cement. They have a festival in the neighbourhood of Santiago on July 25th where they celebrate mass, have a procession, and set off fireworks. There is dancing, the Chinelos [a traditional Mexican dance] and food for all who go to the Santiago neighbourhood party.\r\n      \r\n Pompilia and her family dream and hope to purchase a truck to transport the clay, firewood and their merchandise for sale to Tonatico in the state of Mexico. \r\n       \r\n The group members are: Fidelia M.

In her second last year of high school she lost parents and due to lack of support started a business selling smoked fish. She has a daily revenue of 30000 to 50000 and gets her supplies from the inland markets or from the riverside villages where fishing is the principal activity.  With the loan she hopes to receive, she will buy 5 baskets of Mboto (large carp). 10 baskets of brown bullheads (Ngolo) and 8 baskets of sea lamprey or eel (Nzombo), all heavily consumed fish in Congolese familiies.\r\n\r\nIn time, she has plans to expand and to open a large fish outlet, and have the riverside suppliers deliver their baskets of fish rather than her having to make the trip by canoe each week. The more she increases her stock, the greater her profits will be, enabling her to increase her savings and in turn provide for her family and put her children through tertiary level education.<br

She has had her business for four years, starting with some savings. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying more rice, flour, and other foods.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed to invest in her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).\r\n\r\nThe rural area surrounding Hato Mayor is an area where the economy is dominated by agriculture.

L. is a 43 year old woman who lives with her husband and five children in the community of Canalete, which is located in Upala, Alajuela Province.  This place is located in a semi-mountainous area where the main business activities mostly revolve around livestock breeding and agriculture.  In this community there are great opportunities to develop and establish micro-enterprises, particularly in the agriculture and retail sectors.  \r\n<p>\r\nSeveral years ago Do\u00f1a Marta decided to start her own business, so she bought a cottage next to her house and rents it out to students and tourists in the area.  This provides her with a source of income that will allow her to move her children forward.  However, due to the lack of maintenance, the cottage is in very bad condition.  It needs to be repaired so that it can be rented out and continue generating income.  For this reason, Marta needs a loan of 617,000 CRC to buy windows, doors, and wood to repair the kitchen and fix other details that are lacking so that the cottage can be used.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Marta is a member of the Canalete Communal Credit Enterprise, one of 100 member organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her third loan and she hopes to continue growing on a personal and financial level.  She is also an active participant in her local credit organization.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Entrepreneurs Program.  They made the decision to work so that they could help their spouses move their families forward in the best way possible.  All of the women in this committee come from modest families.  They are hard workers who want to see their children complete a higher education so that they can have a better life.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members is Sra. Nelida who sells eggs and chickens.  She says this business requires a great amount of attention because the birds are very delicate in terms of their care.  Her greatest source of revenue is the sale of eggs, but she also earns income when she sells hens that she no longer needs.  \r\n<p>\r\nNelida sells the eggs to different businesses in the area.  Her customers constantly request her product in large quantities.  She is requesting a loan because she currently needs to buy specialized feed for her hens.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":576473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase poultry feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Paraguari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26 -57.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"N\u00e9lida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcialina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Docci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Belen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredesvinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":10949132,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1824856},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1824856},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1824856},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1824856},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1824856},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1824852}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824856,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1836750.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638758,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824856,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1836750.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852820,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824856,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1836750.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119587,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824856,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1836750.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413544,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824856,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1836750.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182553190,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1824852,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1836746.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188689614,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-29T18:13:59Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":219012,"name":"Reyna De Los \u00c1ngeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Reyna de los \u00c1ngeles R.

In the photo she is found in the back row, second from the right, and is wearing a purple jacket. She bakes pastries, alfajores (a traditional Arabic confection) and various cookies and sells them in a stand that she has created in front of her house. She also distributes wholesale for other business to sell within the neighborhood. Fabiola learned how to make pastries from her father who was a bread-maker and pastry chef.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Fabiola intends to purchase the principle ingredients needed to produce these goodies. Her dream is to one day open a pastry shop in a grand location and afterwards add to it a shop that will sell these ingredients for other to make them too.\r\n\r\nFebiola lives with her husband and 7-year-old daughter. She enjoys participating in the weekly bank meetings along with the other socias (borrowers) and the loan officer. She credits Fondo Esperanza\u2019s weekly bank meetings with enabling her to socialize with other entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences too.\r\n\r\nLa Florida is a community located to the southeast of Santiago (the capital of Chile). The community itself is quite diverse, representing all sectors of socioeconomic levels. This area has an active commercial life which is manifested in the existence of several new shopping centers.

Even though it has been a long time since she first moved to Barranquilla, Judith still remembers the moment when she arrived in search of new horizons.  She began working at uncle\u2019s bakery.

She and her mother engage in a series of income-generating activities such as making uniforms, selling fried meats such as \u201csalchichas\u201d (sausages), and selling merchandise on credit such as bed linens, clothing, shoes, and the latest cosmetics.  Julieth also works as an employee at a job where she exercises the technical skills she learned while attending university.\r\n<p>\r\nShe lives with her husband and five year old son.  Julieth wants to teach her child the values that defined her life and were instilled in her by her parents such as family stability, love of work, and responsibility.  She began working at a young age while studying for her technical degree in information systems.  It was while she was at university that she began her business selling products such as bed linens, towels, and women\u2019s accessories to her classmates with the help of her mother.  Upon finishing her degree, she began working at a private company where she found opportunities to increase her customer base for selling merchandise.  At the same time, she became involved in producing uniforms.  Since she was not directly responsible for the sewing, Julieth began initiating negotiations to create new sources of income and now has contracts with educational organizations.  A woman uses the machine in Julieth\u2019s home to do all the sewing under the supervision of her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that has supported the development of her entrepreneurial creativity.  These available credit resources have provided her with opportunities to invest in her businesses and have the capital to increase her earnings.  Another aspect that has improved is her income since she can pay for her son\u2019s studies at a bilingual school.  In addition, she is able to make business purchases in cash so that she can get a better price, which makes her more competitive when selling her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nAs a businesswoman, she is still refining her abilities while working at the job she obtained upon finishing university.  She does all this so that she can provide a better future for her family.  At the moment, Julieth is requesting a Kiva loan to invest in the purchase of fabrics so that she can fulfill her school contracts.  She will also buy different types of merchandise such as clothing, towels, accessories, and shoes.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
