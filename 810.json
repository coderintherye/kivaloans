The Trust Bank is located in a small town called San Jose Xepatan, Patzun, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, which is a very agricultural area. The majority of the inhabitants grow vegetables like green beans and broccoli. Within the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank, five of the women are engaged in agriculture, another woman sells fruit, two ladies have convenience stores and one member operates a tortilla-making shop. All of them are also weavers. \r\n\r\nMaria is on her fifth loan with Friendship Bridge. The 54-year-old has never attended school and is divorced. She has six children, and four of them are still at home. Maria is an entrepreneur and works hard every day to support her children. She buys and sells vegetables and fruit, traveling to the market, which is located 20 minutes from her home, to sell her products on Tuesdays and Fridays from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. During the rest of the week, Maria and her family work in the field growing green beans and broccoli. Maria only started selling fruit five years ago, but her business is growing, which allows her to dedicate more money to raising crops. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s dream is to expand her businesses so that she has a larger variety of products to sell. She wants to use her income to help her younger children continue in school; most of her older children only have a sixth-grade education. With her new loan, she will be purchasing seeds for planting more green beans and broccoli, as well as purchasing fruits and vegetables for resale.\r\n\r\nLike Maria, the other eight women in the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank are so thankful to have the support of KIVA investors. The women realize that KIVA investors work hard like they do and appreciate that others are willing to share their earnings with women in Guatemala so that they can create better opportunities for their children.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds for planting green beans and broccoli, and to purchase fruits and vegetables for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Patzun, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-03-19T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-18T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":3275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Dalila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eulalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":25200,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2520},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2520}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T00:55:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":404484,"name":"Violeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Violeta is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

While it is a fairly quiet community, the town has a variety of bustling commerce activities. In the West Village of Patzun, the Trust Bank Mujeres de \u00c9xito (Successful Women) was formed four years ago and currently has nine determined women in the group, all of whom identify with the name of the Trust Bank. The vast majority of women in this group are engaged in hand weaving, selling screws and selling fruits and vegetables. They are all neighbors and know each other well.  \r\n\r\nMaria Magdalena is a member of the Mujeres de \u00c9xito Trust Bank. She is 50 years old, married, and has eight children (four of them still live at home). Thanks to Maria and her husband\u2019s hard work, all of her children were in school until the heavy rains hit Guatemala last year and her oldest child, who was in college, had to drop out. Maria Magdalena only has three years of education, because her family couldn\u2019t support her schooling anymore. Maria learned to make huipiles (traditional blouses) when she was a child, and over time she learned the styles from other places. She now makes different styles of huipiles from different areas. She also learned how to make chocolate (a product that originated in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, where she is originally from). Maria Magdalena travels to Antigua, Guatemala (two hours away from home), Monday through Saturday and sells her products from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. She also sells her products in Patzun on Sundays.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Maria Magdalena will buy fabric and thread to make huipiles. She will also use the materials to make aprons since her orders are on the rise because the Easter season is fast approaching. She will also use her loan to buy more ingredients to make chocolates so that she can keep up with demand (she has many orders for chocolates as well). One of Maria Magdalena\u2019s goals is to grow her businesses and have her children help manage the businesses with her. She also wants to help her child, who had to drop out of college, go back to school. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful to Friendship Bridge for the opportunity to have been a client for the past four years, which has allowed her to invest in her business. Likewise, the Trust Bank that she belongs to feels so grateful to the KIVA lenders because even though they do not know the lenders, they rely on their support. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy fabric and thread to make huipiles and aprons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Patzun, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-03-19T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-18T17:30:04Z","loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingry Nineth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn Merida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T20:28:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405368,"name":"Mijgona","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0438\u0447\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0434\u0430\u0442. \u0415\u0439 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0444\u044e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432.

In 1982 after finishing school she began as a simple laborer in a factory in Bishkek, where she worked for three years. In 1985 she married, moved with her husband to the town of Temir-Kanat in the Tong district and found work in the Tong district's manufacturing plant. Unfortunately her and her husband's salaries were not enough to cover the family's expenses. After working until 1991 and having saved up 5,000 som, Saparkul decided to begin her own livestock business, and bought a milk cow. \r\n\r\nEven as she just began to work in agriculture, Saparkul set a goal: to have a large farm and a well deserved and bright future for her children. Being by nature a purposeful, patient, hardworking woman, Saparkul was able to reach her goals. At this time she has 3 head of cattle, 20 head of sheep and one horse, an smallish sheepyard and 2.10 hectares of irrigated land from which she harvests clover, wheat, barley and potatoes annually. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Saparkul came to the Bai-Tushum and Partners company for a 120,000 som (KGS) loan, with the goal of increasing the number of livestock she has for raising and later sale. Saparkul plans to use profit from the loan to invest in expanding the sheep yard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1048406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Temir Kanat village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-19T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-18T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":2575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saparkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3465},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3761},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3858},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3958},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4060},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4165},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4273},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4383},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4496},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4612},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4731},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4854},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4979},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5108},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5240},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5375},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5514},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5656},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5802},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5952},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6106},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6264},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6426},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6962}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T18:35:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402766,"name":"Bexy Lucia Zambrano Mendoza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bexy de 57 a\u00f1os vive (suburbio Guayaquil).
