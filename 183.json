This motivates a lot of cocoa traders like Ni Komang Wiriasih to seek side businesses, such as selling seasonal fruits.  Ni Komang Wiriasih is married to I Komang Suarya.  Besides selling cocoa, she also trades Rambutan and Durian that is in season during the rainy season.  The profit is sufficient to supplement her income to pay for daily expenses.  Ni Komang Wiriasih just paid back her second loan of $500, and is applying for another loan for $92 that will be used to purchase more fruits.  With this additional funding, Wiriasih hopes to purchase more produce from farmers and reap more profit until the summer when cocoa season peaks.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by

She sells gado-gado (Indonesian Salad), ice, and other snacks.  As her client base increases, so is her profit.  She was assisted by an earlier loan from Kiva and DINARI foundation.  Ni Wayan Sueli is helped by her daughter in managing the kiosk.  In the morning, when Ni Wayan Sueli goes to the market to purchase foods to sell, her daughter takes care of the kiosk until her mother comes back.  Also in the evenings, when Ni Wayan Sueli is performing her household chores, her daughter also take care of the kiosk.  Therefore the kiosk can remain open longer during the day.  With the profit, Ni Wayan Sueli managed to fulfill her daily family needs and pay down her loan from $200 to $100.  In this third period, Ni Wayan Sueli plans to use the loan to purchase a refrigerator to make ice, keep vegetables and perishable items.

They have an average age of 33 and, on average, 4 children, and they live mostly in monogamous families in the  Bozo Kin neighborhood of Sansanding (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). <P>\r\n\r\nThey mostly sell fish in diverse forms (fresh, smoked, dried) and also condiments. The need to grow their working capital led them to organize themselves and join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom they are on their second group loan. The first was correctly reimbursed. <P>\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 2 jerry cans of 20 liters of cottonseed  or peanut oil, 4 baskets of fresh tomatoes, a ton of fresh onions, 3 basins of green peppers and fresh hot peppers, 300 kg of smoked fish and some dried sardines. They do their buying once a week at the fair of  Sansanding as far as vegetables go; their oil and fish are from Macina. The fish are re-sold at the fairs in Siribala, Dougabougou and right there in Sansanding; the other condiments are sold from their homes and in the market of Sansanding for cash or credit to a clientele essentially constituted of women. <P>\r\n\r\nThey hope to make a monthly average profit of 19,000 F CFA which will be used to increase their working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":277792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of fish and condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satou                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135858,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033670,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621038,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020003,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242748,"comment":null},{"amount":245.85,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":126062.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678289,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T23:09:14Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":91294,"name":"Fadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fadi A. is a young and energetic man who has been caring for his elder mother since his father passed away a year ago.

Sanobar is 34 years old and comes from a large and humble family.  She is married and the loving mother of four children.  \r\n\r\nHer father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work.  Therefore, she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. \r\n\r\nNow she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle.  With the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. \r\n\r\nSanobar asks for a $600 loan for the term of 12 months in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown.  With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life.  Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Even so, she now finds herself with more expenditures and she would like a loan in order to increase their capital by increasing their production. \r\n\r\nBinodira and her family are waiting for your quick response. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.  \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zamira is a polite and hard-working entrepreneur in Penjikent, Tajikistan.  Known for her honesty and dedication, she works long hours running her own small clothing store where sells mainly women's clothes and underclothes.  \r\n\r\nZamira is lucky because her store is located in an excellent location, so she has an excellent sale rate.  That's why she's confident she will be able to repay a loan of $1000 in full.  \r\n\r\nZamira is single and lives with her parents, but the high inflation rate in Tajikistan is making it difficult for her family to maintain their basic standard of living.  With the loan, Zamira hopes to purchase more inventory to grow her business and improve her family\u2019s living conditions.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

B. is a 40-year-old man who lives with his wife and two children. Jasray, his wife, works at the shoe factory, and the children go to school. He moved to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, from the countryside a decade ago. During the last 10 years, he has been making traditional belts called Gyargan. The beautiful belts are made from woven silk. Before 1930, this type of belt was used commonly by the lamas, or Tibetan Buddhist priests (50% of Mongolians practice Tibetan Buddhism, or Lamaism, according to the CIA World Factbook). \r\n\r\nNowadays, very few people know how to make Gyargan belts. He learned to make the Gyargan belt from his aunt. At first, it was hard for him to find clients. But now he has many customers who buy the Gyargan belt to use during the lunar New Year celebration. Uuganbayar weaves only one belt in 3 days, or about 10-12 per month. His monthly income from his business is MNT 160,000-180,000 (1500 MNT=$1 USD).

Bozor is 43 years old and was born in Penjikent, Tajikistan.  He is the father of four children, and his main work consists of breeding cattle. \r\n\r\nThis very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family.  A very ambitious man, he would like to buy a greater number of cattle and build a farmhouse to house them in order to ensure their safety.  Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of $800 for the realization of this project. \r\n\r\nBozor promises to repay the loan in 12 months.  When his dream is carried out, he will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family.  With your help this will be possible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Oblokul has always been a hard-working man who has made sure, from his young age, that his family never went without the daily bread.  He is married and has four children. \r\n\r\nOblokul has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs.  With a starting capital of $500, and thanks to his perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 2 years ago.  Today this business has become domestic and his children and wife are also engaged in the business. \r\n\r\nToday Oblokul needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase his range of goods for sale.  For this purpose he is requesting a loan of $800 for the term of 12 months. \r\n\r\nHe is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.  We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.  \r\n     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rafoat is a 39 year old woman.  She is married with four children.  Since she has lived with her husband, she has worked in the business of buying and selling cattle and also breeding sheep.  \r\n\r\nShe walks through the farms and several settlements to buy cattle at the lowest price to be able to increase her profits.  She currently has 2 cows, a calf, and 4 sheep which she will fatten for some time to later sell them.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan she wants to buy calves and feed for his animals.  This will be her first loan with IMON International, and her evaluation shows she is qualified to receive the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n\r\nShe is engaged in this business together with her husband.  Slowly, the number of cows has increased and, with that, her clients started asking for more and more.  With an endless list of requests she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and, for this reason, she is requesting a loan. \r\n\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Radjabmo\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sharofat is 51 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two adult children. Mrs.Sharofat sells such goods as detergents, hair accessories for girls, batteries, blades, machine twist and treads, pens and other items. She has been in this business for 5 years. Her husband helps and supports her always. The business is successful and brings considerable income to the family. Today, Mrs.Sharofat wants to expand her business and to increase her working capital to purchase additional goods for resale. For this purpose, she requests a loan of $ 800 US Dollars for a term of 12 months. She has borrowed from IMON several times and having always duly repaid her loan payments. She is a good client of IMON and promises to manage this loan with diligence. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He began working as a day labourer, later became an independent merchant, until one day he managed to build a home and had the idea to open a convenience store, which he still runs to this day.\r\n\r\nAlfonso wants this loan to increase his stock of merchandise because he had previously invested in building walls for his house and now needs to reinvest in his store.\r\n\r\nHis store is

Mavjud is 43 years old.  He is married with 5 children.  He is a small entrepreneur who sells different kinds of foodstuffs and household goods like cookies, soft drinks, juices, tea, detergents and many other items in his grocery store, which he built 2 years ago. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Mavjud has about $1000 in inventory.  His monthly net profit is about $300.  \r\n\r\nToday, Mavjud is requesting a loan of $800 for a term of 12 months to increase his stock.  He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once and awhile to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is that his children progress by means of their studies, for which he is doing all the best.  We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her greatest expense at the end of the month is mainly school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nShe also sells grasshoppers, during their season, at the market. She works seven days a week and she pays rent for the place she works. Pauline normally receives about 10 people a day, both men and women. She sells her products on a retail basis, and has been in this business for over 10 years.\r\n\r\nPauline complains of the very expensive transportation from the villages where she purchases her goods. And the grasshoppers only come seasonally, which is twice a year. She has worked with MCDT for six years now and she chose to work with MCDT because of the school fees loan they give to their clients. She will use this loan to increase her stock and she also hopes to educate her grandchildren until they graduate from university.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":277933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

There are their activities:\r\n\r\nJuan C.: Grinds corn to make tortillas, nacatamales, and rosquillas.  He has been doing this for many years, and also works construction.  He tends to his customers at the mill from 4:00 am until 6:30 am, after which they are attended to by his wife.  Juan is 64 years old and has three children who, thanks to his business, he has been able to help succeed.  Presently, one of his sons is attending high school.

He also needs to buy some spare parts for his mill.\r\n\r\nElias M.: Also has a mill to grind corn.  He gets up early to begin serving his customers at 4:00am.  He has been doing this for many years.  Some years ago he had an accident with a machine while working in a factory that produced cigar boxes (the machine cut off four fingers from his right hand), and so he decided to start this business and, thanks to God, it's going very well for him.  He has five children, one of them a teacher and the others in high school.  Elias needs this loan to buy some spare parts for his mill.\r\n\r\nEsteban S.: Mr. S. is married with five children, and his primary occupation is selling ice cream on foot in different neighborhoods in the city of Danli.  This business generates income to be able to feed his family.  Currently he needs to invest in merchandise since summer is coming and it's the high season for ice cream sales.

Triunfadoras has been formed in the 28 of March village.  Its members are Santos Isabel O., who is 45 years old and has three children.  One of her daughters drowned eight years ago in a pool, which was very difficult and has made it hard for her to get her life back in order.  Her son is 22 years old, already graduated and has a cellphone repair shop.  Her daughter is still in school.  Santos Isabel has been able to provide for them thanks to her cosmetics sales, and she needs a loan to buy lotions, creams, and shampoos.\r\n\r\nYesenia S. is 20 years old, a single mother of a 3 month old baby whose father doesn't support them, so she has  had to pay for all the costs of child care by herself, with the help of her mother who takes care of the baby while Yesenia works.  Yesenia sells shoes and used clothing sent from the United States.  Thanks to this business she is putting one foot in front of the other and succeeding, but she needs to buy more merchandise to sell because her baby needs food, clothing, diapers, medicine, and she has to pay for it all herself.\r\n\r\nLeonor C. is 39 years old, a single mother, and has two children, one of whom has already graduated who is working and helps Leonor with some of the household expenses.

They buy their goods either from Makeni or the other villages surrounding Makump. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the group's sixth request for a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one of them in the group received a loan of 800,000 SLL. That loan had meaningful impacts on the lives of these people. They were able to use the loans to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They were also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are now requesting a loan of about $330 (1,000,000 SLL) each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nAmidu (right) is the leader of the group. He is 60 years of age and was born in Makump village. He is married to 3 wives and they have 19 children. The eldest is 26 and the youngest is over 1 year old. His wives too are businesswomen; they joined him in the business. Amidu has been a businessman for over 30 years now.\r\n<p>\r\nAmidu sells palm kernels. He and his wives walk around the surrounding villages to search for and buy the palm kernels and then sell the palm kernels in Makeni. A pan of palm kernel costs him 1,000 SLL. With his loan, he will be able to buy 30 bags of palm kernels.  \r\n<p>\r\nAmidu and his wives faces one challenge in their palm-kernel business and it is that of transporting the kernels from the villages to Makump village. Since these are villages, there are no vehicles around to help them transport the kernels. Apart from this, Amidu is doing fine is his business and he enjoys doing it.

The job has always allowed her to provide for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan through The Foundation she will be able to buy fabric so that she can then make school uniforms and other uniforms as well.  With the rest of the loan she plans to buy an industrial sewing machine. \r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Alexis of San Roque High School)<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kendra Gaete, Kiva

She has her own sewing workshop, where she makes garments, shirts, skirts, pants, and jackets. She has spent 33 years in this business. She begins working very early so that she can deliver her orders on time. She is very friendly, cheerful, and is very dedicated to her work. She sometimes only covers her labor since her clients bring the materials for her to work on, but in other cases, she buys the materials. She lives with her mother and takes care of her because she is sick. She is single and needs this loan to buy a new sewing machine since the one that she had for many years is ruined. She also needs to buy buttons, thread, oil, lace, and zippers.

Flores school. She has 3 children: the eldest is 27 years old and works as a teacher, like his mother; her daughter is 20 years old and is in her first year of university at the University of Uraccan; and, the youngest is 13 years old and is in grade 6. She is requesting a loan for the 8th time through AFODENIC (Kiva Field Partner) to invest in changing the zinc and purlins of their roof (to purchase zinc and purlins) because it is in need of replacing. Her life partner works as an agriculturer, both sharing the household expenses and the compromises made to AFODENIC. Eventhough they are a family of limited financial resources they are known as very responsible and humble people. This family is very loved by their community especially because she has been a teacher for 21 years teaching the children of their community. Her dream is to be in good health, to have work and to have a beautiful home for their family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She started the business in February 2006 thanks to an invitation that she received to attend a course on handicrafts.  She learned very quickly and was able to learn to make many different type of crafts such as baskets, paper flowers, bathroom sets, handbags, etc.  She offers these goods to her friends and coworkers.  Each time she meets more people who enjoy her crafts, and they recommend her goods to others.  This process continues very well and she is able to have a flow of steady income.

She enjoys making different crafts very much, and it is an activity that she can perform in her house whenever she wants.  At the same time, she can take care of her grandchildren.  She began the business in March 2006 thanks to a teacher that taught her to make crafts.  She first started making handbags and bathroom sets, and later began making things related to each coming season, such as paper flowers for the Day of the Dead and decorations for Christmas, Friendship Day, Children's Day, Mother's Day, etc.  Thanks to God, she has been getting more customers through recommendations from other people who liked her work.  She needs a loan of $6,000 MXN that she will repay in 12 installments that she will use to purchase raw materials such as cloth, glue, foamy, thread, scissors, paper, etc.  This will allow her make decorations that her customers entrust her to make for special dates and events.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva

did not have the opportunity to study due to his family's economic situation.  He has been part of a similar business before.  Since he was a child, he has had experience as a salesman, so he wanted to test his luck in this work.  He began the business in February 1984 from an inheritance from his grandfather and from his mother.  Since they dedicated their entire lives to this business, he took advantage of their relationships and experience to continue doing the same thing.  He has progressed a lot since each time he has more customers and he has been able to hire three salesmen who sell in different parts of the city.  In addition to selling in the streets, he has many customers who make orders to decorate their children's parties, so he doesn't regret dedicating himself to this activity.  He needs a loan of $12,000 MXN that he will repay in 12 installments.  With this credit, he is going to buy balloons, gas, thread, plastic, etc.  so he will be prepared and well-stocked for Children's Day which is celebrated on April 30 in Mexico.<br

This is not his regular source of income because he can only get income when people call him to paint their houses. <P>\r\n\r\nHuma baji shares the financial burden of her husband by doing decorative embroidery. She prepares embroidered dresses, taking the orders from her relatives and neighbors. Her husband is very happy with her caring behavior. Huma baji successfully repaid two loans from Asasah (a micro-finance institute in Pakistan). Now she is applying for a loan to buy more paint for her husband\u2019s painting business. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader for some more women from her locality. Rani baji wants a loan to buy leather to sell. Rehana Kosar baji wants a loan to buy paint to sell. Josphen baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Nazia baji wants a loan to pay off the remaining installments on her auto-rickshaw.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

Panen yang lalu I Komang Wistra mendapatkan hasil 500 kilogram. Namun, saat ini harga vanili sangat rendah, yakni Rp. 5.000.- per kilogram.

Pinjaman kedua ini I Komang Wistra berencana untuk lebih fokus untuk tanaman kakao karena hasilnya lebih baik dan harganya stabil. Pinjaman kedua ini dipergunakan untuk biaya pupuk dan bibit kakao untuk memperbanyak tanaman kakao yang sudah dimilikinya.","en":"I Komang Wistra has fully paid off his 1st loan from DINARI foundation.

She sells charcoal in Makerere Market in one of the city suburbs. Mastula works seven days a week and buys charcoal from villages where she incurs extra transport costs.  Mastula pays a license fee of 20,000\/= per month as well as rent plus an operating license   She sells to an average of 20 customers a day and sells to all categories of people, both retail and wholesale.  <P>\r\n\r\n Mastula has been in this business for the last 20 years and has been with MCDT for only one year, but is servicing her third loan, working all this time with the same group mates.  Mastula is faced with a challenge in the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her and makes transportation of her merchandise difficult, because roads become impassable.
