Christine ambitionne augmenter le stock de ses produits pour mieux faire face \u00e0 la demande des clients. C'est ce qui am\u00e8ne Christine \u00e0 solliciter un troisi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9. ","en":"N. Christine has been living for twenty years in the Zogbo district in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Married to ADJAGBE Michel, a fisherman, she is the mother of three children.  All of the children are in school and live together with their parents in Zogbo.  The couple jointly ensures that family expenses are covered.  \r\n\r\nFor about twenty years, Christine has been selling smoked shrimp at the Gbogbanou market, and this brings in the revenues she uses to cope with her different responsibilities.  She supplies herself from the shores of the lagoon in Cotonou.  \r\n\r\nShe is a previous client of ALID\u00e9 having already benefited from two loans, which have been repaid.  Facing the demand from more and more customers, she no longer manages to satisfy them all.  Her ambition is to increase her stock of goods in order to cope better with customer demands.  This is what brings Christine to request a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":473814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buying shrimp in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-20T20:50:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859071,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619214,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653095,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835234,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575627,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954128,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055789,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347333,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482466,"comment":null},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10385.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617316,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-20T21:33:47Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169986,"name":"Hazel Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hazel Jean A. is from the village of Lurugan, Valencia City.

Charlotte has been settled in the Zogbo district of Cotonou for around 15 years. Married to Gilles AGBOHO, Charlotte has four children. All the children are at school and live with their parents in Zogbo. The couple has another child in their care, as well as their own children. Charlotte's business brings in an income and allows her to help out a little with the family's various expenses. Charlotte has not been to school. For around five years Charlotte has been selling kitchenware (plates, iceboxes, sets of bowls). Charlotte also sells shoes, which allows her to multiply her sources of income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the past 11 years, N. Mahmanain has run her own clothing business at the clothing market in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She and her husband have four children and her business is an important source of income for the family. Mahmanain's income helps her to support her children with food and education. \r\n<br>Lending services from Kiva partner, IMON International, have been a key support for Mahmanain as she has developed her business. She has proven to be a great client and has maintained a perfect payment record. Mahmanain is requesting a loan of 8000 TJS to boost her available capital and allow her to purchase new inventory. We are grateful for the opportunity to further assist in the success of this dedicated entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mais actuellement Marie \u00e9prouve de difficult\u00e9s dans l'approvisionnement de ses produits. C'est la raison pour laquelle Marie sollicite un troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat afin de satisfaire la demande de sa client\u00e8le et aussi d'\u00e9largir son champ d'activit\u00e9. \n\n","en":"T. Marie was born in 1974 and lives in the Zogbo district in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Marie is married to AVOCEVOU Noel, who is a tailor. The couple has 4 children, some of whom are enrolled in school. All the children live together with their parents in Zogbo. The couple share in supporting the family. <P>\r\n\r\nMarie was never enrolled in school. To support herself, Marie sells cooked food (maize and rice porridge with various sauces) out of her home. She buys her ingredients in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin, and in Fifadji market. Marie has already received and correctly reimbursed two loans from ALID\u00e9. Her clientele is continually growing but she currently has difficulty procuring her ingredients. That is why she is requesting a third loan so that she can satisfy the needs of her clientele and also expand her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has three adult children. To make a living, C. raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. C. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 Vietnamese Dong a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, C. joined SEDA, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. C. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. C. is now requesting a new loan of 7.840.000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan she has taken out from SEDA.

The official name of this borrowing group is C\u1ea7u Gi\u1eefa 1 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n\r\nK\u1ef7 is married and has two school-aged children.

K\u1ef7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. He is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. K\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

Djibil F., age 30, is a new client of U-IMCEC in Thies, a city about 50 miles from sprawling Dakar. \r\n\r\nDjibil earned his diploma as an electrician in 1999, inspired by a long interest in all things electrical. However, he has found it difficult to find steady employment, so he supplements his income by raising chickens. Chickens can be a profitable activity, because each one can fetch as much as $6.00 in the markets. Djibil's older sister taught him the trade, and he has been raising chickens for about a year. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 300,000 frs (Communaute Financiere Africaine francs, also known as \"XOF\"), he will purchase 200 chicks and about a dozen 50-kg (~110 lb.) sacks of feed.

She is the coordinator for her group, Las Iluminada (The Illuminated), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nLaura lives with her husband in a simple home north of the Dominican capital. The area is very crowded and typical of urban areas in developing countries. Running potable water is inaccessible, electricity is scarce if available at all, and health care is inadequate at best. Despite these and other difficulties, Laura runs a successful small business from her home, selling women\u2019s clothing. She is very grateful for this loan, her third from Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to expand her business.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Laura plans to use this loan to purchase women\u2019s pants, blouses and undergarments, which she will then sell at a small markup to friends and neighbors. Laura\u2019s loans have helped her business immensely and as her business grows, so do her loans. Her current loan is 150% the size of her first loan and Laura continues to increase her sales and profits. She hopes to have her own home one day and help her children progress. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in 11 offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

She would like to use it to purchase more food to sell in her shop, as well as to buy kanga and vitenge to add to her offerings.

Mariam believes that selling these fabrics in her store will greatly improve her business by attracting many new customers.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Mariam is seated in the front row wearing the yellow-green dress (which happens to be tailored from vitenge cloth!).

He usually works in agriculture, but because it doesn't offer him the stability that he needs, he set up a small grocery store in his in-laws' house a year ago.

The closest town is 15 minutes away.\r\n\r\nIn order to handle the great demand for his products, Pedro saw it necessary to request his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN so he can invest in the purchase of more products and expand his business.\r\n\r\nHe is well-known and loved by his neighbors and other people who know him.

She is married and her husband is a farmer.  They have 5 children: 4 are married adults who live on their own.  The youngest lives with his parents helping them with household tasks and the farm.   They have been growing pitahaya (dragon fruit), pineapple and bananas for the past 15 years.  The main problem facing them has been the lack of capital to be able to improve the crops.  Coupled with this last year the family had the tremendous misfortune of losing a son.  This family tragedy led to a series of big expenses to cover.  They had to manage these expenses with their savings that they were going to use to invest in the business.  That is why they are asking for a loan-to take care of their crops with the purchase of fertilizers.  This will improve their economic situation and help them repay the loan, and will generate the means for new family projects.\r\nThey have been a very humble and responsible family over the years-their community will confirm this.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":474032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T02:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura Katalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.16,"local_amount":3.15,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841718,"comment":null},{"amount":199.84,"local_amount":3996.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4175.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770591,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T05:02:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170087,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

Her husband works as a security guard at a hotel in Guayaquil.  They have one child who attends a private school near their district.\r\n<p>\r\nTwo years ago, Jacinta started selling rice and sugar from her home.  Gradually she started to generate the income needed to buy more groceries for her business.  She now works every day by herself selling all types of food.  Some complications that she encounters are the diseases that develop during this time of the year because the district experiences a lot of rain.\r\n<p>\r\nWith his loan, she will buy rice sugar, canned goods, and an assortment of candies to restock her store.  In the future, she hopes to finish the construction of her house and be able to expand her business even more.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Nguyen Th\u1ecb (10117120017) is a 42 year-old woman living in the town of Dong Anh - Hanoi.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, Nguyen Th\u1ecb operates a family member's business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling soft drinks in the local community.  Nguyen Th\u1ecb H. has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Nguyen Th\u1ecb joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Nguyen Th\u1ecb has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.250.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Nguyen Th\u1ecb is now requesting a new loan of 6.758.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Nguyen Th\u1ecb H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":474075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Along with his wife he has endeavored to give better opportunities to their two children.  His wife emigrated to the United States of America to be able to work and improve their dwelling, since the work here in Nicaragua is scarce.  Se\u00f1or Juan has various businesses; he teaches English, has a taxi and a small bookstore in his home.  He gives classes part time in the morning, then in the afternoon provides his taxi service.  In his house he has a person that administers the bookstore.  He does all this with the objective of obtaining profits to be able to make improvements to his house, such as to pay for water, lights, and telephone. He has achieved all this with his efforts and the remittances that his wife has sent.  With the loan that he is requesting he will buy building materials such as: stone, sand, iron and cement and other things to be able to make the porch across his house and to have more space, since he has the bookstore in the living room and it is small and makes things difficult.  He wants to invest more and relocate the bookstore on the porch.  For more security from outsiders, since it would be on the porch it needs better security.  In the future he would like to be able to increase sales, to buy other showcases and to be able to offer more products.  All this he expects to achieve with his work and the support of the institution.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":474085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy building materials to add a porch to his house where he can relocate his bookstore.

She is a single woman and lives with her mother and her brother in the Vichayal settlement, district of La Arena, province of Piura, in the region of Piura, located 3 hours and 35 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that due to the fact that that her father abandoned them, she had to begin to work to support the family economy.  She is dedicated to the sale of salchipollo and rice with chicken (typical dishes of the country) in the evenings.  She cooks these dishes on a stove constructed of rustic materials that she installed in her house.  During the mornings she helps her mother with the tasks of the home.  Also she is dedicated to raising and selling poultry.  \r\n\r\nMaria Esther desires to buy a cart with a grill to facilitate the food sales in the evenings, but does not have sufficient capital to carry out this action.  Because of this she has seen the need to request, for the first time, a loan of 1000 new soles from Edpyme Alternative.  \r\n\r\nHer greater desire is to study the technical career of nursing in the city of Piura.  She is a responsible, hard-working youth and businesswoman.

He and his wife hope to succeed in giving them a good education. He is 41 years old. His wife works selling cellular phones to cover the costs of water and light, among other things, since everything has gone up in cost. \r\n<p>\r\nHe works as a gasoline pump technician. He has been working in this business for two years, but he has worked at the same job in past years. When he was unemployed, he sold cellular phones to be able to feed his family. With his previous loan he was able to begin building the room but he did not finish it due to lack of capital. For this reason, he will buy construction materials such as stone, sand, cement, and boards to be able to finish the room and a wall that he also wants to make, since what he has now is made of wood and is already very old and in bad condition. Thanks to the instituiton for its support in making this improvement in his home and for the approval of more capital, which he is waiting for to finish the work he began.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor in the eastern lowlands of the Dominican Republic where the economy is centered around agriculture and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure of wooden walls and a tin roof with her husband and her son.\r\n\r\nJosefina is excited to be taking her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans without arrears. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling clothing and shoes by purchasing blue jeans, blouses and shoes. Her business model is to take orders for clothing and then to go to Santo Domingo and purchase the clothes in the main markets and come back to her community to sell the items at a profit. While 80% of her product is ordered in advance she will sell the rest by walking around the community and searching for clients.\r\n\r\nJosefina will use the profits to invest in her home by completing the project her husband has started to replace the wooden walls with cement block. She also intends to continue investing in her family by purchasing medicine, school supplies and clothes for her son. In the long term her goal is to purchase a small plot of land so that she can construct her own home, as her current home is owned by her parents. She also plans to start university classes in business management soon. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":474096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more blouses, blue jeans and shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T01:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zorilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":61000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4583.98},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4669.26},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4756.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4844.6},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4934.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5026.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":5120.02},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5215.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5411.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5511.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5614.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":127.75,"local_amount":4583.98,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4605.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118067730,"comment":null},{"amount":130.13,"local_amount":4669.26,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4691.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118067731,"comment":null},{"amount":271.46,"local_amount":9740.51,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":9786.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123902905,"comment":null},{"amount":423.51,"local_amount":15196.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15267.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128937344,"comment":null},{"amount":295.68,"local_amount":10609.58,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10659.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136665070,"comment":null},{"amount":141.4,"local_amount":5074.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5097.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144697981,"comment":null},{"amount":153.6,"local_amount":5511.77,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5537.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144697982,"comment":null},{"amount":156.47,"local_amount":5614.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5640.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151881033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T07:02:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:40:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170125,"name":"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M\u1ef5 \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb operates a family member's general store selling school products such as pencils, pen and notebooks in her community.

He works with his wife in order to support their two children who are in school.  His goal is to give them a good education since he and his wife were not able to finish studying due to the financial situation of their parents.  His wife started to work as a housekeeper and her earnings help to pay the water and electric expenses and part of the school expenses for their children.  Don Cesar has worked as a carpenter for the past 11 years making beautiful furniture, doors, beds, and other pieces.  He gained experience first by working as an apprentice.  Later, thanks to God and the help of Afodenic, he was able to start his own workshop which he now runs.  His challenge is that sometimes the cost of lumber is very high and he cannot afford to buy enough to fulfill his orders or to make his pieces.  With this loan, he will purchase a variety of lumber to finish his furniture and fulfill his customers' orders; also he will build and sell beds, chairs, wardrobes, etc. in order to gain new customers and better income to be more stable economically for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":474117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase of lumber to make wardrobes, beds, chairs and other furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T04:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.67,"local_amount":1593.49,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1664.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874538,"comment":null},{"amount":38.99,"local_amount":779.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":814.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604407,"comment":null},{"amount":39,"local_amount":780.04,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":814.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821657,"comment":null},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":791.72,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":827.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561665,"comment":null},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.82,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":812.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770595,"comment":null},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":783.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":818.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204485,"comment":null},{"amount":74.68,"local_amount":1493.62,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1560.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T06:40:16Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170131,"name":"Julio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, su estado civil es casado, tiene un hijo que depende de \u00e9l, la familia vive en casa que es propia.

Tip\u00f3n Communal Bank.  Our members are situated in the Tip\u00f3n community in the department of Cusco.  The region is known for its recreation areas, and it is famous for its open air restaurants on all of the roads.  They sell \u201cchicharrones\u201d (typical dishes containing pork with roasted potatoes, sweet corn, and salad).  In the Tip\u00f3n area some sell chicharrones, and others sell baked guinea pigs.\n\nOur members have different commercial activities.  Among them are raising small animals, buying guinea pigs, chickens, hens, and pigs.  They raise them, and in time they fatten them, and the animals reproduce.  The members who work in this field sell the animals.  Then they buy animals and start again in another season.  Another group of members sells beer and soft drinks wholesale.  They distribute them to different restaurants in the area that sell baked pork and guinea pigs.  Other members have grocery stores to supply the regions with diverse products for their kitchens.  Another member sells breakfast and all types of snacks.  Another group sells clothes and cosmetics.\n\nMrs. Cintia MarceL. B. C. is 38 years old and lives with her partner and their son. She has been raising guinea pigs since 2002. She started with 20 guinea pigs, which eventually reproduced. She buys guinea pigs, and once they are full-grown she sells them.

She has been engaged solely in selling for six years. When she started, she did it with a part of the severance from her job. With the support of her husband, she was able to help cover living expenses, since everything is expensive and you must have initiative to get better income and be able to get by and obtain your goals. Due to a lack of funds, she has no clothing, only jewelry. This is why she neds to invest in clothing for uniforms to be able to sell such as: skirts, shirts, pants, socks, undershirts, and to purchase a variety of clothing to grow the business'  inventory. Her long term goal is to have a little store at her house. She is happy with the financing since thanks to this loan she will purchase merchandise to sell and satisfy clients with what they need.

Community Bank Nueva Juventud (New Youth) is made up of a group of hard-working women who are using their strengths to get ahead and help their families.  They have become great friends, all of them live in the Cuenca area, a city that is known for its friendly people, its landscapes, and its historical center.  It is a lovely city that attracts national and international tourists.  Maria M. has been  a member [of Nueva Juventud] for two loan cycles.  She was invited by her friend Celina Cornejo.  Maria lives in the Conferencia neighborhood in the Quingeo district, in her little adobe house with her husband, their eight children and two grandchildren, because her oldest daughter\u2019s husband left her.  Her 23-year-old daughter needs extra care because she is epileptic and requires continuous care.  Due to a lack of financial resources they are not able to give her all of her necessary medications.  Her 19 and 16-year old children both work and help out with the family expenses and her 14-year old daughter helps at home, caring for their animals and the other three children, who all still attend elementary school.  Her husband works in agriculture and at a sawmill when there is work.  This member [Maria] raises chickens and guinea pigs and also has a dairy cow that provides milk for her family.  She also works in agriculture, planting corn, beans and garlic with her husband.  With the money she will receive from the Foundation she will buy guinea pigs and food for guinea pigs, so she can raise and sell them.  She dreams of opening a fast-food restaurant.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":474204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"guinea pigs and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T16:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074738,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910721,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946381,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946382,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674693,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674694,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708854,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708855,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892156,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T18:56:15Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170168,"name":"Fama","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fama N. est une femme de 46 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

Most of the members are from the same neighborhood and know each other well, which makes them a united group that works together to keep the bank running smoothly.  The members are all responsible adults.  Among the different jobs of each member is the president, who works as a traveling cosmetics saleswoman, which generates a good income for her.  There are also members who sell food from their homes, make and sell empanadas, soft drinks, members who work in hardware stores, housecleaning services, and some of the men work as moto-taxi drivers.  Competition is very tough for the members, especially in cosmetics sales, food and transportation services, but the members know how to keep moving forward with enthusiasm and hard work.  The loan will be used to grow their businesses, increase their sales and offer better service to their customers, so that in the future they will be able to give their children a good education and improve the quality of life for their families.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by RachE.

She is married with 2 children.  Carmen began as a manufacturing employee and worked for many years but had to resign, due to her child's long-term health problems which impeded her from complying with work hours.\r\n\r\nSince that time, she has looked for opportunities to work independently, for a way to generate income that will permit her to care for her son.  This is how she came to make dresses for a long time, which wore her out.  For this reason, and knowing how to handle customers, she decided to become a merchant.  For the last 7 years she has sold products, using specialized guides to products, in order to continue to add to the family income, in union with her husband.  He is also a merchant, selling disposable products and operating a pharmacy.\r\n\r\nHer small beginning capital was fortified from the start by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with more than 6 loans, each gradually increasing as the last was paid off.  She believed that each loan should be administered cautiously, that is, directing them towards investing in merchandise to reproduce her working capital, which she has been doing all this time.  She is very satisfied with the loans she has received; her monthly payments have been negotiated by the assessor during the first visit at payable amounts and desirable periods that would benefit her family.\r\n\r\nPresently, she is applying for a loan of $2,000,000 (Colombian pesos) to be used to obtain discounts in paying off previous invoices early, and to buy merchandise requested by her customers.  Her principle goals are related to changing neighborhoods; buying a house in a more central zone where  she will be close to her principle customers, who are employees and independent workers.  She is very selective in granting small amounts of credit, with an initial quota set when each begins as a customer.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

She has applied for her first loan of 3,000 PHP to add to her capital for running her sari-sari store business. The future income from this business will be used for basic daily needs and loan repayments. Rosita is hoping that her business will make good progress and that she will be able to send all her children to school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":474340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"As additional

Saul is a carpenter who makes timber furniture in Bungoma town.

Now, they earn an average net income of at least PHP 4,000.00, which benefits their family.  \r\n\r\nNow on her fifth loan with a good credit record, Lina was given the privilege of borrowing PHP 8,000.00 to buy additional fishing nets for her bunsod. She will use the future income from this loan to meet her family's daily needs, repay her loan, and save for the future. She hopes that this project will result in a good catch with God\u2019s help."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":474455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fishing nets for her bunsod (fish corrals)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Maquilao, Tangub City, Mis.

P. is from the village of Victoria in Alicia, Isabela. She is 34 years old. Marilyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marilyn sells \"sawali\" and \"cogon\" (long grasses that, when dried, are used for the roofs and walls of houses) in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a loan of 10000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Marilyn's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: \r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs. Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Maybileen R..\r\n\r\nMaybileen is single. To make a living, Maybileen raises and sells pigs. Maybileen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maybileen joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maybileen is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future. This will be Maybileen's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<P>\r\n\r\nJosie is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Josie owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Josie has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately  2000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josie is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Josie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<P>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 42 years old. Gloria is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner, While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGloria is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Gloria runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gloria has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gloria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Gloria is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Gloria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 49 years old. Marciana is the group leader of a 10-member group offered a loan by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nMarciana is married and has four adult-age children. To make a living, Marciana owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Marciana has been engaged in her business for over one year, and she earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nMarciana joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marciana is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marciana from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI: <br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anna is 39 years old, married, and has five children -- two girls and three boys -- that range in age from 4 to 17 years old.  Anna says that all of her children are attending school.  Anna also helps support her mother, who lives in the countryside.<P>\r\n\r\nAnna has a business selling foodstuffs such as beans, rice, and oil, and household staples such as soap.  She has had her business in Thinker's Village near Monrovia for about four years, and says she ran a similar business elsewhere for about ten years before setting up shop where she is now.  Her customers are people in her community.<P>\r\n\r\nAnna plans to use the proceeds of her 6,000 Liberian dollar loan (her share of the 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan) to buy more inventory for her shop.  She buys from a large market in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, and transports the goods back to Thinker's Village about 20 kilometers away.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita runs a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the third loan taken out by Carmelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 44 years old. Mercy Joy is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nMercy Joy is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mercy Joy owns and operates a business venture raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Mercy Joy has been engaged in her business for over ten years, and she earns approximately 20000 PHP every four months.\n\nIn 2009, Mercy Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercy Joy is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mercy Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \n\nAbout ASKI: \nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":472137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She is 35 years old and the single mother of six children between the ages of 3 and 17 years old, and their educational level is from kindergarten through eighth grade. She also cares for two sisters.\r\n\r\nQuita and her family lives and works in Thinker\u2019s Village, a newly established community at the southern outskirts of MonroV., the capital of Liberia. She was never able to go to school herself due to lack of financial support from her parents.\r\n\r\nQuita\u2019s business is bricks production. She buys cement in bulk and produces construction bricks to be sold to residents of Thinker\u2019s Village. She has been running this business for eight years and hopes to own a building materials store in the near future.\r\n\r\nQuita started by selling doughnuts and she managed to raise 6,000 LRD to get into bricks production. She produces strong and long-lasting bricks in order to encourage customers to continue buying from her.

Red Light is Liberia's largest market, a bustling area near the capital (Monrovia) that is full of shops, stalls and vendor tables.\r\n\r\nDaniel is 37 years old and married with five children, aged 7 months to 16 years old. He also cares for two of his wife's aunt's daughters. Daniel is a high school graduate and went on to university but had to stop his studies after the first year due to a lack of money to pay school fees.\r\n\r\nDaniel\u2019s business is selling kerosene. He buys wholesale in 55-gallon drums and then sells gallons of kerosene to his customers. Most of his customers are from rural areas and use the kerosene for lanterns and cooking.\r\n\r\nDaniel's share of this 27,000 Liberian dollar group loan is 6,000 Liberian dollars. He intends to buy more kerosene with the money from the loan.\r\n\r\nDaniel has been running his business for five years and this is his first loan from Kiva field partner LEAP. Daniel says the key to his success has been talking to customers in a good manner and sometimes he adds bonuses to their purchases to reward them. His dream is to own a gas station someday.\r\n\r\nIf he makes good profits from his business, Daniel hopes to be able to educate his children as fully as possible, send his wife to school and complete his own university education. He also wants to build a house for his family.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Daniel is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\n<b>About LEAP:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating micro-finance institution, with 13 branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship. LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs and puts emphasis on lending to women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":474723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more kerosene for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-01-22T01:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":27000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1113},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1991},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1995}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.49,"local_amount":1113,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952493,"comment":null},{"amount":29.5,"local_amount":1991,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2094.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952494,"comment":null},{"amount":236.68,"local_amount":15976,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16804.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985505,"comment":null},{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":3920,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4123.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711318,"comment":null},{"amount":59.26,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4207.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997875,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-22T16:05:26Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":170394,"name":"Anastasio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Anastasio tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es conviviente y tiene tres hijos.
