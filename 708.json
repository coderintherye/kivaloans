Jydyzkan is a teacher and has been working at the local school for the last 15 years. She has a reputation of an energetic, responsible and hardworking person. Unfortunately, a village teacher's salary is not very high and to be able to provide for her children's future Jydyzkan is supplementing her income by raising cattle. She started with a small amount of money, 5000 som (KGS) and now her business yields a profit of 5000 som every two months. In order to further expand her herd Jydyzkan has turned to \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) so that she can purchase more cattle. In the future, she is planning to expand her livestock business so that she can collect enough money to pay for college education for both of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":911112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jydyzkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-13T06:40:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354637,"name":"Muniraan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muniraan has applied for a loan from KIVA partner Asasah for her husband who is an embroidery expert.

His wife's name is Natalia. They have a young daughter, 3-year-old Anastasia. Vladimir works as a manager at a business selling car tyres. He travels extensively for his job, using his personal car. Unfortunately, the car he owns is constantly in need of repair. Vladimir is asking for a loan of 8,000 UAH. This is the additional sum he needs to purchase a new car. Buying a new car would make Vladimir's work much easier. Also, the amount he spends on fuel for the car will decrease, and so the family's discretionary income will grow."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":222,"image":{"id":911117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for

","en":"Elmira is 43 years old, married and has six children. Elmira is a biology teacher, and has worked at a school in the city of Naryn for 19 years. As a goal-oriented and hard working person, Elmira has passed on her love for learning to her children, four of whom have university-level degrees. In search of additional income to support their family, Elmira and her husband started a business, breeding and selling animals. Initially, they invested a sum of 25,000 KGS in 2001. Today, Elmira's farm consists of two cows, sixty sheep and ten goats, bringing in a total income of 4,000 KGS per month. To further expand their farm, Elmira has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners, for a loan of 100,000 KGS, to purchase a bull and sheep. Elmira plans to use the profits gained from investing the loan to build an additional barn for the animals.

","en":"Mayramkul is 44 years old, married and has three children. Mayramkul works as a cook at a local school and is known for being an optimistic and joyous person. As a way to provide additional income to her family, Mayramkul started her own business, raising and selling animals, initially investing 5,000 KGS. Today, Mayramkul's farm makes a profit of about 10,000 KGS per month, which covers the expenses of her family and the cost of feed for the animals. With the goal of increasing the number of animals, Mayramkul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals. This will allow her to expand her farm, and she plans to use a part of her income on preparations for her son's wedding.

Sayrakul has a degree in accounting, which has helped her to start up and successfully run a grocery store in the town of At-Bashy. Her store has become a family business, and Sayrakul's son and his wife have always helped out, to this day playing an active role in running the store. Being a goal-oriented and hard-working person, in 2010 Sayrakul started a business in breeding, raising and selling farm animals. Now Sayrakul has three cows, one horse, and thirty-three rams. To further grow her farm, Sayrakul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS to buy sheep.

living in the village of Frunze (in northeastern Kyrgyzstan). He is married, and raising three children: 16, 13 and 8 years old. Since 1991, Janybek's family has been successfully raising lifestock, and selling farm products. They especially focus on growing apples and pears, as well as processing wheat. Now, Janybek has 3 cows, 2 horses and 10 sheep. Janybek's perseverance and hard work has allowed him to cover his family's expenses and save for his children's post-high-school education. To further increase the number of animals at his farm, Janybek is turning to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals to fatten for market. Janybek plans to use the money he makes on improvements on the barn, to ensure good living conditions for his livestock.

Two of Asankan's children became farmers just like their grandfather and help out with the family business.  Since 1991, Asankans family has been successfully involved in breeding livestock and reselling agricultural products.  Starting with a capital of 20,000 som (KGS), Asankan was able to develop his business to have a monthly income of 13,000 som.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, he requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock for fattening up.  Asankan plans to use the expected profit to build a new barn in order to provide good conditions for keeping livestock.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":911171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase additional livestock for fattening up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tasma village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-08T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asankan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T09:29:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354667,"name":"Dieynaba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dieynaba est une vendeuse de produits alimentaires tels que bananes pommes orange et autres, elle est bas\u00e9e \u00e0 domicile et elle fait de l'ambulante au niveau du quartier et dans les zones environnantes. \nElle approvisionne au garage et dans les stations de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de bananes, ces produits viennent souvent de la sous r\u00e9gion ou de certains pays limitrophes.

Her husband works as a welder.  Yulduzkhon decided to become involved in retail sales at the local market seven years ago, after investing a sum of 25,000 som (KGS) - money that she earned through hard labor in Russia, where she and her husband used to travel for work.  Times were hard for Yulduzkhon at first because she did not have enough money and had to borrow it.  Due to this, her husband continued to travel for work, thus, helping Yulduzkhon to get her business off from the ground.  Today, Yulduzkhon actively works and currently has a revolving capital of about 150,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase her revolving capital and expand merchandise assortment.  This will also allow Yulduzkhon to work together with her husband and avoid future travels for work.  Yulduzkhon's dream is to expand her business and build a big house for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":655.36,"image":{"id":911182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to broaden merchandise assortment and increase revolving capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-08T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulduzkhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7208},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7318},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7525},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7738},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7958},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8183},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8415},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8653},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8899},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9151},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9410},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9542}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":319.57,"local_amount":14526,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":14614.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722510,"comment":null},{"amount":165.55,"local_amount":7525,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7570.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125441,"comment":null},{"amount":170.24,"local_amount":7738,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7785.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250594,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T17:41:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354671,"name":"Coumba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Coumba s'active depuis des ann\u00e9es dans le secteur du commerce.Son activit\u00e9 consiste a vendre a domicile des vaisselles , bols,verres, etc. En m\u00eame temps elle vend des tissus qu'elle ach\u00e8te en provenance de quelques pays limitrophes.

raising two children.  He is a farmer, who is involved in fattening up and reselling livestock and agricultural products.  Thanks to his diligent daily labor and persistence, Sarynzhy was able to develop his farm to have two cows, ten sheep and two horses, and to bring his family a monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS) from the sales of dairy and meat products.

She works hard to support the education of her two children who are both in high school\r\n\r\nFrancisca maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers count on for their income. Aside from direct selling, she sells processed meat. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 5,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 36,000 that will help her to continue her business. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. \r\n\r\nFrancisca dreams that her business will continue to grow and she will have more sales. She hopes that her children will be able to finish their studies and enjoy a good life. She never fails to attend to the fellowship* every week. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She goes out to sell her products on the sidewalk outside her house.  She had been selling her food continually for seven years but stopped approximately one year ago owing to some problems.  However, six months ago she started selling her food again and her business is up and running again.  As her food is tasty, her customers are always seeking her out so that they can eat her delicious dishes.  She works alone and would like to make progress, doing her good work.\r\n\r\nWhat Ida likes about her work is that it gives her time to be with her young son and she also has time to take care of her household.  Her business is doing well as her customers are very loyal.  This is because she provides good customer service and delicious food.  She hopes to continue selling her food for a long time to come and, in the future, she would like to improve the infrastructure of her business.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Ida's second loan from MFP.  Her first loan went very well and she hopes to be able to continue doing well.  She is very grateful for the loan she has been given as it will allow her to re-start the work that she used to carry out which is going better now.  She will use the sum of 1,500 soles that she has requested to buy ingredients and supplies so that she can continue with her food sales business.  She hopes to be able to buy in bulk as this allows her to earn more."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":367.01,"image":{"id":911404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T00:50:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":219.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":239.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":248.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":250.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":267.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":275.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.01,"local_amount":219.16,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":227.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621937,"comment":null},{"amount":91.83,"local_amount":239.55,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":248.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836011,"comment":null},{"amount":95.25,"local_amount":248.49,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":257.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245770,"comment":null},{"amount":95.92,"local_amount":250.22,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":259.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385804,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T02:16:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354708,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Judith, de 31 a\u00f1os, es una mujer joven y alegre, es conviviente con su pareja con quien tiene un hijo de 14 a\u00f1os, aunque su hijo no esta cerca de ella pues vive en la ciudad de Lima.

His daughter is nineteen and she is studying in her junior year at the Yerevan Institute of Linguistics with specialty as a teacher of foreign languages. Yurik's wife works in the military recruitment office in the town of Kapan.\r\n\r\nYurik has been in the distribution business since 2006. He has a contract with a firm which manufactures natural juices, ice cream, cookies, confections, meat products, cutlets and etc. Yurik buys all these products and juices in wholesale, delivers them from Yerevan and then sells them in wholesale to the stores in towns of Kapan, Kadjaran, Agarak and Mergi. Yurik has storage and refrigerators in his house for the business. \r\n\r\nYurik works almost without any days off and already has many regular customers in these towns who for many years prefer to buy in wholesale what Yurik brings from Yerevan and then sell in their own stores. Thanks to the profit from his business Yurik can support his family and pay for his daughter's education.

In one he works transporting passengers while in the other motorcycle taxi is rented to a driver daily. On the other hand, he has a barn where he raises poultry. He has an average of 300 chickens. The breeding process takes 40 days, and then he takes them to sell them in different markets in the city. He has two years in this activity, while with his motorcycle taxis he already has more than 10 years. What he likes about his job is the freedom that it gives him and being able to walk around the city on his own schedule. So it is going well and it pays well with his two jobs. Later he wants to strengthen his business raising birds and buy another pair of motorcycle taxis. This will be the third loan with the institution MFP. He likes belonging to this group as it is doing very well and he has very responsible partners. With the amount requested, he will buy many parts for the renovation of his two motorcycle taxis. He has to restore the upholstery, tires, rims and conduct maintenance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":366.35,"image":{"id":911677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To send his motorcycles to the mechanic, buy parts, tires, and upholstery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":219.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":238.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":240.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":257.74},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":267.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":276.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.14,"local_amount":219.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":227.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621953,"comment":null},{"amount":91.29,"local_amount":238.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":247.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836028,"comment":null},{"amount":92.12,"local_amount":240.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":249.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245787,"comment":null},{"amount":98.8,"local_amount":257.74,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":267.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-07T14:42:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354734,"name":"Roel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roel is 46 years old and married.

In winter, goose is the most popular poultry; in spring and autumn turkey is the most popular, and chicken is popular throughout the year.

There are 20 entrepreneurs who work in the areas of preparing traditional food and selling clothing and perfume.  All of them live in the city of Castro.\r\n\r\nNilda is a member of the communal bank; in the photo she is in the middle of the group, in the third row from the bottom, wearing glasses.  She works preparing and selling traditional food in the southern part of Chile.  Among these dishes are \"milcao\" [potato pancakes], \"chuchoca\" [potato bread], \"empanadas\" [meat pies], homemade bread, and \"curanto\" [clambake].  She has been in this business for 14 years, and she uses her home to prepare the food.  She has a gas stove, a wood-burning stove, a dough spreader, pots (metal cooking containers in the shape of a half-sphere and generally with two handles), and pans.\r\n\r\nShe says that her schedule is totally flexible and that the season of highest demand is during the summer, since there are many traditional festivals and fairs.  Generally she buys her ingredients in the supermarket, where the prices are better, and in this way it has gone very well for her.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to build a \"quincho\" [thatched barbecue area] to offer her meals in the same place, so her customers eat the food right there.  Nilda also wants to get an industrial oven for her meals, since she also works in rendering, which consists of killing and later cooking a pig and other food in a cauldron to make lard.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and two children, ages 19 and 17, who help her advertise her meals and attract new customers.  One of her dreams is that one of her children will finish studying, since in that way there would be better job options.  She also would like to travel throughout the country to know some places.\r\n\r\nNilda is very happy and grateful for the services granted by Fondo Esperanza, since she can count on capital that will allow her to invest in her business.  She also enjoys the communal bank meetings with great happiness and affection, since the group is united and supportive.\r\n\r\nCastro is the capital of the island of Chilo\u00e9 (the biggest island in South America), in the region of Los Lagos, in the south of Chile.  The natural landscape is conserved almost totally without human intervention.  It also has a culture rich in myth and tradition.  The \"palafitos,\" structures (houses) built on wood pilings on the shore above the ocean, are one of the greatest attractions there.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":917622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

De ese modo, se encarga de preparar panes todas las noches, los que vende todas las ma\u00f1anas en la puerta de su casa, y que a\u00fan no tiene un local adecuado para expenderlos. \u201cDiario invierto 70 soles, comprando harina, az\u00facar y manteca; del preparado salen 25 latas de masa y por lata obtengo 35 panes\u201d, explica Luz, adem\u00e1s comenta que inmediatamente recupera sus 70 soles de capital y gana otros 70 soles, \u201ces muy rentable\u201d, agrega. En el trabajo apoyan su esposo y un personal al que pagan mensualmente, por ser una labor ardua y cansada. Antes, ella y su esposo viv\u00edan en una casa alquilada, ahora la compraron. Sus ans\u00edas de progreso no descansan, ahora est\u00e1n tramitando la licencia de funcionamiento para una bodega y panader\u00eda a la vez. Con su ayuda, Luzmery podr\u00e1 acceder a su primer pr\u00e9stamo de MFP, por esa raz\u00f3n se muestra firme en su idea de pagar sus cuotas los d\u00edas programados. Con el dinero del cr\u00e9dito, ella podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de panes, tales como sacos de harina, sacos de az\u00facar y bolsas de manteca. \n\na","en":"Luzmery, 27, and her partner have been together for 11 years.  They have a 2-month old baby and three older children who are 11-, 5-, and 3-years old, respectively  They live in a house they own in La Union.  Luz, as she's know, operates a bakery business.  She bought the bakery from her father-in-law in May so she can now manage it in a way that better suits her.  She makes batches of bread each night and sells what she makes in the mornings after.  She sells the bread from her house because she doesn't have a large enough shop for selling.  Luz says, \"I spend 70 soles a day buying flour, sugar and butter to make\" [a nightly batch of bread].  She says, too, that she makes back the 70 soles she spends on supplies plus another 70 soles.  \"It's very profitable\", she adds.  Her husband helps her with the business.  She also has an employee who she pays by the month to help her with the difficult and tiring work.  She and her husband rented before, but they own their own house now.  Luz's drive to get ahead knows no bounds: she is processing the paperwork to get the licenses she needs to operate the business as both a bakery and a shop.  With your help, Luzmery will be able to secure her first MFP loan.  She is committed to repaying the loan on time and says she will use it to buy flour, sugar, butter and the other supplies she needs to operate her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105.26,"image":{"id":912044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies for her bakery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luzmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":70.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":71.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":79.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":80.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":88.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":94.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":98.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":102.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.12,"local_amount":64.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":65.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621954,"comment":null},{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":136.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":138.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245788,"comment":null},{"amount":29.9,"local_amount":79.73,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":80.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385822,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T17:59:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":354977,"name":"Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santiago, vive con su esposa y tres hijos, \u00e9l es agricultor en peque\u00f1o y administra una granja peque\u00f1a de pollos, \u00e9l tiene 15 a\u00f1os de estar dedicado en esta actividad, lo aprendi\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de su padre.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas como abono y herbicidas, adem\u00e1s de comprar pollos para la granja, este aporte ser\u00e1 muy necesario para Santiago, ya que podr\u00e1 aplicar lo necesario para el cultivo y aumentando su granja.\nLa aspiraci\u00f3n de \u00e9l es seguir mejorando, tanto los cultivos como la granja, as\u00ed podr\u00e1 dar a su familia lo necesario.\n","en":"Santiago lives with his wife and three children.

She lives in the company of Ra\u00fal, her husband of 11 years.  They have 3 children, who they care for in their own house, which is located in the Conopa annex.  As responsible parents, they hope to give their children a good education.  And so they rented a room in the city of Huancayo where the children can study.  They take on all their responsibilities together, as partners.  Carmen's husband works in transportation using the car he owns.  His route is very long, and so sometimes it takes an entire day for him to get back home.  He earns a minimum of 100 soles a day.  They are still finishing up paying off the car, which took a lot of effort to purchase.  Carmen, on the other hand, makes her living in agriculture.  She plants potatoes, beans, corn and peas on her own land.  She sells her produce after each harvest in Acostambo's market.  In addition, she raises a lot of cows and pigs which she fattens to later sell to the butchers who visit the area.  For now, she hopes to improve her profits and finish paying off the car, which is her primary concern.  Carmen belongs to the communal bank \u201cConopa,\u201d and this is her third loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will receive the help that she really needs.
