She has been in this for a long time now, and success is her watch word. She believes the business will succeed because she has targeted a period where there will be scarcity of firewood and at that time it will be expensive. The loan will help her community because they will be able to buy firewood and other items in her provision store at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nP. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family.

Margarita is borrowing PHP 25,000 to fund her business operations.  This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

In the future, the family wants to purchase a piece of land in Kerben for farming.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Srey is 48 years old. She and her husband, Mr. Touch, are farmers who own a very small piece of land where they can grow rice not to sell but to support their family.

She is 46 years old. She and her husband have four children (three sons and a daughter).\r\n\r\nGulzada was born into a simple family. She was the middle child, and spent most of her time working around the house: she looked after younger brothers and sisters, did her homework and did some housework.  Gulzada did very well in school and dreamed of becoming a teacher. After graduationg, she entered Osh State University in the physics and mathematics department. After finishing school, she married in 1984 and planned to work in her trade, but it was too difficult to live on a teacher\u2019s wages.  Gulzada and her husband decided to raise cattle. They began with one single lamb, and for ten years increased their livestock.  With the money they made, they constructed a small house in the village. At that time, 400 square meters of undeveloped land were allocated to each family.  Unfortunately, the income from selling the crop did not cover the expense of planting.  In 2000 the family decided to move to the Chuysky valley to their native village.  It was very difficult to sell their house and all of the cattle. When they moved to the village of Alekseyevka (in the northern part of the country), Gulzada\u2019s family bought a house, one milk cow, and two sheep. Eleven years have passed since then.  The family has had many hardships: in 2005 Gulzada and her husband decided to plant wheat, but because of a recession affecting the price of grain, the couple lost a great deal of money.  To pay their debts, Gulzada had to sell all of their cattle. Thanks to persistence, diligence, and family support, Gulzada\u2019s family has made it through and continues to work in their business. Today Gulzada\u2019s farm has two calves being fattened, two young cows, and she is cultivating potatoes.  \r\n\r\nGulzada had approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and ewes.  Gulzada plans to use any money she makes to pay to educate her children.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

P. is from the village of Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 55 years old, widowed and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Solidad owns and operates a retail store selling daily use products such as canned goods, noodles, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Solidad has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, Solidad joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Solidad is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

El cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para la compra de golosinas, pan, galletas, juegos, gaseosas y granos b\u00e1sicos.

in 1978, Kang D. is married to Che Emmanuel and has five children. She has been very hardworking from the day she joined GHAPE. Her desire is to work for her children\u2019s education and pay for their school fees so that they can be educated. She decided to become a member of GHAPE due to her inability to get investment capital that could give her higher income to meet her children\u2019s needs and the family's needs. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy piglets and feed. This investment will help people in her community to have pork. She also wants to invest part of the loan toward purchasing a farm to start the growing of vegetables. \r\n\r\nShe is planning to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school. She will plow her profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees, and she will save some for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost of obtaining and paying back the loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":724508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"piglets, feed, farm tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ndamukong, Bamenda, NW.

She is a hard working lady and has faced many challenges in life, such as being a widow at a young age, ill health and being unable to take care of her children. Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in the year 2009.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, Mary received her pioneer loan of 40,000 XAF, and the repayment was done promptly. With her new loan of 75,0000 XAF, she plans to buy seedlings. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time. She has good land for farming.\r\n\r\nHer neighbors are happy for the business she is doing because it will reduce their distances to the market and because they will be able to buy from her at a cheaper cost. She plans to use the profit from the business to plow back into the business, care for her son and provide good medical attention for herself and her son. She prefers borrowing from GHAPE because of the social services GHAPE offers, and because the method of repayment is comfortable. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

At the age of 8 he helped his uncle with piling up the corn and herding cattle. He worked with his uncle for 25 years, and for this he had given him 3 meters of land to plant beans and corn. At the age of 12, he saved his money and was able to buy 16 meters of land himself.  He sold it to buy a different plot of land located in Ocotolillo. He married at the age of 30 when he already had his own farm, where he raised his children and sent them to school as long as he was able. \r\n\r\nHe asks for a loan to be able to maintain his coffee farm, including activities like filling bags, regulating planting, and manure.  His future plans include improving the condition of the farm, renovating the old coffee in order to get a better yield from the harvest, and improving the quality of the coffee.  His main goal is to increase the amount of land his has from 8 to 10 meters, since this way he will be able to plant more and increase his income, and at the same time improve his family's quality of life and give them financial stability.

The \"foraging\" season is now beginning for her coffee crop (when they take off the first mature beans), and she hopes to obtain good income from it.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the village bank \"Flor de Almendra\" and this is her first loan with MFP, where she is known as a responsible woman and hopes for good results from the work with this association.  Teresa has four seedbeds of coffee (plantings in black bags with fertile soil) that she will transplant to her farmland during this season.  With the loan that she requests, she will invest in buying compost, tools, and paying workers to help her with the farming.

Every day they make an effort together to get ahead. For the last two years this enterprising woman has worked selling the beauty products of a recognized brand. She is very satisfied with her job as it allows her to take care of her children and make a profit, no only from the sale of her products but as well from the household appliances she earns from her order points. She used to work in a company but when she had her first child she decided to dedicate herself completely to taking care of him and that is how she started this business which regularly generates profit. She sells through catalogues to her friends and acquaintances and then brings them their orders for which they pay by credit. As well, she buys beauty products when they are on sale and keeps them in stock for a while to sell them at regular price.

Upon receiving her severance pay, she started her business and now has no regrets because it has enabled her to generate a good income.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of a large quantity of merchandise since she has several orders to fulfill.  She wants to make her purchases all at once because the city where the wholesale market is located is a long distance away.  Being an enterprising woman, Yuliana has plans in the future to establish an Internet caf\u00e9 in a space in her house since there is no competition in her area.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Yuliana promises to complete her payments on time because she does not want to look back in the eyes of those who made this loan possible so that she could continue working and making progress.  She plans to invest the loan she requested in the purchase of various food products so that she can improve her earnings.  This income would allow her to start a new Internet business without having to quit selling food products.

He continued to grow vegetables until he was able to buy his own land.  \r\n<p>\r\nHugo got married when he was 17.  Of all his children, two are in their first year of college.  There are others who are in their third year of high school and must walk one hour to get to their classes.  Another child helps with planting and has passed elementary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nHugo grows cabbages, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes.  He is requesting a loan to buy supplies, fertilizers, compost, and pay for labor to continue with the cultivation of his crops to promote output and quality.  With this harvest, he hopes to expand the size of his farm so that he can pay his expenses with the revenue he generates.  His goals include seeing his children earn their university degrees, achieving self-sustainability, and developing new crops of potatoes and cabbages.

He is single with 2 children.  He started working when he was 5 years old, doing farm work for his father, tending the family garden and his father's coffee crop.  When he was 12 years old, he started full-time work because he had to support himself.  He met the mother of his children when he was 22 years old, but they've never married, only been together for years.  A year and a half later, he decided to plant vegetables and other produce that he then could sell.  He made enough to set up a small store selling everyday commodities--food and other everyday items--and a meat-butchering business.  He was able to use the income from the business to buy his own house.  He's succeeded in maintaining his level of sales and even buying a vehicle of his own.  One of his children is in elementary school and the other is one-year old.  \r\nJose is applying for a loan so that he can prepare his fields and plant coffee.

She tells us that it has been very difficult to get her children ahead in life because the wage that her husband earns as a construction worker doesn't cover all their household expenses.  Sometimes he has no work which has made it difficult to achieve financial stability since sources of work are very scarce in their town.  For this reason, Mar\u00eda decided to set up a small store in her home in order to support her husband with their expenses.  She will invest her loan in buying more merchandise.  Her wish is for her children to continue in their studies and for them to become good professionals some day.

is a married woman who lives in Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Jose, who is 60 years old, is retired but helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children. Anita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500, which she added to her own capital, helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion and savings. Anita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Eleuteria, 51, is married and lives in Talic, Oroquieta City,  Misamis Occidental.

She used her first loan of PHP 3,000 to buy one piglet and this is how she started her hog-raising business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to God that her hog-raising business has done very well and she has buyers already. Now she is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000 to buy feed and more piglets. She also wants to build a concrete piggery for her pigs.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

families' standard of living. Mrs. Chuob is the village bank president who has been selected by the other members. She was born in 1955. She and her husband, Mr. Sunney, are farmers who own a plot of land where they can grow rice.

Both of her children attend a local secondary school. \r\n\r\nAlimaa graduated from a vocational school as a tailor in 1986 and worked at a local clothing factory for six years. She began operating her own business in 1993. In the beginning she made clothes at home, however in 2008 she began to rent a workplace in a bigger trading center. Since she began her own business she was able to save enough money to buy the land they currently own. She wants to have her own workshop in the future so that she can save money on rent. \r\n\r\nAlimaa is a hard-working and brave person who says, \"I want my two children to get a good education so they can live without any difficulties in the future.\" She is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to buy a stitching machine for her business.
