This loan will be an important part in the growth of Sheroz\u2019s business.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In total, she has 3 cows that provide her with milk for sale and 100 laying hens that very soon will be laying  eggs. These hens are replacement of those that she had sold. She is requesting a loan to purchase more laying hens to expand her business. As a result of investing more in her business, Esther has been able to save  money which has helped her with buying household items as well as making life comfortable for her orphaned grand children. Esther is a widow with 7 children. Most of her children have passed away and left her with the care of the grandchildren that she has to work so hard to provide for.

Because of these challenges, life became difficult for her until she saw GHAPE as a source of relief in the year 20004. in that year she received her first loan of 20,000 FRS,then 60,000 FRS in 2005 and 150,00 FRS in 2006. \r\n\r\nCeline is now requesting a loan of 150,000 FRS so she can buy tomatoes, beans, spices, and so forth. She is convinced the business will succeed because of her long experience in the business, and she already has a ready market for her goods. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children's school fees and to cloth them. This business helps her community by supplying food locally, reducing the distance people need to travel to buy food. \r\n\t\r\nCeline prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE provides before disbursing loan and the follow up GHAPE provides after the loan is disbursed.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is married to Elizabeth Bih and they are blessed with three children, all of them above 15 years of age. Patrick and his entire family are living in a house with three bedrooms and one sitting room. As a very hard working man, Patrick has faced many challenges in life. In the process of struggling to earn a living, he encountered many challenges in life such as the death of his pigs and people owing him huge sums of money for work done. These problems made life very difficult for him until 2005 when he became a member of GHAPE and received his first loan (for 20,000 FRS). He received a loan of 65,000 FRS in 2006 and 400,000 FRS in 2007. He successfully repaid these loans. \r\n\r\nNow Patrick is requesting a loan so he can buy \u201cwilberoo\" fish and five piglets and make repairs on his pig pen. Repayment of the loan will start at the fourth month from the day of disbursement. Patrick is convinced that the business will succeed because of the experience he has had in it and he is well known in the community as fish supplier.\r\n\r\nPatrick plans to use the profit from the loan to construct a good house for his family, pay for his children's school fees, and to feed and cloth his family. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE provides before giving out loans and the follow up it does after the loan is disbursed to ensure  proper usage of the loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

is married to Wulie Vincent. They have six children, four of whom are below 15 years of age. Margaret is living with her entire family in a house with three sleeping rooms and one sitting room. Margaret has faced many challenges in life, which made life difficult for her. But in 2006, she became a member of GHAPE and obtained her first loan, which was for 20,000 FRS. She obtained a second loan in 2008 (for 150,000 FRS), and she repaid both loans promptly.\r\n\r\nNow Margaret is requesting a loan of 300,000 FRS so she can buy fruits and vegetables such as yams, plantains, cocoyams, pineapple, carrots, and banana. \r\n\r\nMargaret greatly believes her business will succeed because of the experience she has had in this business and because her goods are in high demand. This business helps Margaret\u2019s community by supplying food locally, reducing the distance people need to travel to buy food. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and to feed and cloth her children. Her repayments will commence at the fourth month from the day of disbursement.\r\n\t\r\nMargaret prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE provides before disbursing loan and the follow up GHAPE  provides after the loan is disbursed.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":252046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruits and vegetables ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

She repaid both loans promptly.\r\n\t\r\nNow P. is requesting a loan of 300,000 FRS so she can buy yams, plantains, cocoyams, pineapples, carrots, and bananas.\r\n           \r\nP. greatly believes her business will succeed because of the experience she has had in the business and because her goods are in high demand. With this  business, P. will help her community by supplying food to them locally and reducing the distance they have to go to buy their food. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and to feed and cloth her children. Her repayments will commence at the fourth month from the day of disbursement.\r\n\t\r\nShe prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE offers before disbursing loans and the follow up GHAPE  provides after the loan is disbursed.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":252047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruits and vegetables ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

She has faced many challenges in life--such as ill health, the death of two of her children, and divorce. Faced with all these challenges, life was not comfortable for Veronica. Veronica learned about GHAPE in 2007, and she is now able to take good care of her children.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Veronica received her first loan (40,000 FRS) and she repaid it promptly. With this loan of 200,000 FRS, she plans to construct a pig fence; rent a plot of land for cultivation; and buy firewood, vegetable seeds, and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nVeronica is sure this business will succeed because of the experience she has in this area, because the demand for the vegetables she is producing is high in her locality, and because she is trusted by the people in her community. Veronica will help those in her community by providing vegetables and firewood to them. She plans to use the profit from the loan to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and to complete her house. Veronica plans to start repayment on the same day of disbursement.\r\n\r\nVeronica prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE because of the rules and regulations governing the institution and because of the follow up that GHAPE does after the loan is disbursed, to ensure the loan is not misused.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":252052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"vegetable cultivation, pig farming, and sale of firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

They have been blessed with eight children, two of whom are still below the age of fifteen. Amabo and his family live in a seven-room apartment in the Ntaghem neighborhood of Nkwen.\r\n\r\nDue to circumstances beyond his control, Amabo didn\u2019t have the privilege of basic education or an apprenticeship to learn a trade, because his parents where poor. Even worse, both his parents died when he was still very young because they did not have money to pay for medication. Amabo joined GHAPE on October 8, 2003. Since then, he has borrowed and successfully repaid four loans and the profits from these loans have helped him to sustain his life and that of his family, as well as to provide for the school needs of his younger children.\r\n\t\r\nWith this loan of 500000frs, he plans to buy piglets, pig feed, wood, and fish to resell from his home so as to reduce the distance that his neighbors must trek to obtain these items. He will use part of the profit generated by this loan to continue to educate his children and part will be reinvested in his business. He thinks his business will succeed because he has been doing this business for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nAmabo will start repaying the loan in the fourth month after he receives the loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":252077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglets, feed , wood, and fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

Thanks to God, she has already made several sales. \r\nJennifer is requesting a loan of 400 soles ($150) to buy merchandise like toys for the Christmas season. \r\nJennifer has found in Finca (Kiva's field partner) a lot of help and orientation for her business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to increase her income, and to buy a sewing machine to make sweaters. She would like to have her own workshop.                                                                                                                               \r\nJennifer has gone through a very difficult situation. When she became pregnant of her fourth daughter, her partner left her. She was in a really bad emotional state and had to get help.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":252198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Toys for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-10T19:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenifer Milagros ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":78.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215435,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":78.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397144,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":78.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088818,"comment":null},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":66.99,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":78.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982174,"comment":null},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":156.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-10T21:04:08Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82733,"name":"Hercilia Vicenta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Herlicia pertenece al Bancomunal Perlas de la Sabidur\u00eda\nHerlicia es de Ancash tiene 36 a\u00f1os, es conviviente tiene cuatro hijos de 12, 10, 8, y 5 a\u00f1os  todos su hijos estudian en el colegio estatal Jos\u00e9 Maria Arguedas, su casita es de madera  \nHerlicia empez\u00f3 hace un a\u00f1o a vender ceviche en al puerta de su casa, fue animada por sus vecinos, ella vive frente a una loza deportiva y siempre hay campeonatos y despu\u00e9s de cada campeonato  la gente quer\u00eda consumir y tomar algo.

mother and has three children under the age of 18.  She has worked as a teacher at Ceta INATEC Nueva Guinea for 5 years.  She is requesting her 7th loan from Kiva partner AFODENIC so she can improve her home by repairing the floor and repairing the roof a bit, which is in bad condition.  She will buy construction materials with this loan.  She is a woman with a great spirit to overcome, as she has been a professional since she was very young, and has developed herself in the labor market.  She is a very responsible and honest person.

His son is in the third grade, while his daughter is not yet old enough for school. His wife doesn't have an official job, but earns extra money each week by offering washing and ironing services, and this money goes towards household expenses. Eliezer's salary goes toward loan repayments and other living expenses. \r\n\r\nEliezer has worked for the Juigalpa Municipal Council for twelve years as a night watchman. He also receives a monthly voucher which the council awards to its workers, which helps him financially. This will be his second loan, and it will be used to continue construction on his home. With his first loan he built walls up to the height of the doors. With this loan he will buy the rest of the stones needed for construction, and perlines and zinc for the roof. Eliezer has shown that he is making a great effort to build a home and provide shelter to his wife and children. It is very sad to have to share a residence with other people who have different personalities, where the children and parents suffer for not having their own roof over their heads. Thanks to the agreement that the council has with AFODENIC, Eliezer will very soon fulfil the greatest dream of his life, which is to provide a good home for his family.\r\n<br

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married with five children and lives in the town of Bamenda, Cameroon.  She plans to invest this loan in her retail business.  She wants to purchase more specifically, yam, paw-paw, oranges, and pineapples.  \r\n \r\nThis is Serah's fifth loan from GHAPE since she joined in 2004. Serah also has an excellent site for her business located at the entrance into the main market of the town. She has seen that there is a high demand in her produce because her inventory is always fresh. Sarah  plans to strengthen her business by purchasing these items from farms located closer to town thereby reducing her transportation costs.\r\n \r\nWith the profits earned from this loan, Serah plans to pay for her children's school fees and other educational needs.  She also intends to buy a piece of land for herself.  She hopes this loan will improve her and her family's standard of living. She plan to repay her loan in 18 months and her first installment repayment will be done on the fourth month from the date of disbursement.\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":252499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She will use the remainder for transport. Her experience helps ensure the sustainability of the business. By so doing, she is very sure the business will progress and grow.\r\n\r\nShe will help her community by providing food and drinks to them.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve ittheirs agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have the opportunity to support themselves through viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have the opportunity to support themselves through viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is a 43-year-old married man who lives with his daughter and owns a small farm. He lives and works in the small village of Penjikent, Tajikistan. Latif has a business raising and selling sheep. He has 5 years of experience in this field. \r\n\r\nBecause sheep raising and selling is a profitable business, Latif has become a very successful businessman in a very short period of time. He works very hard and spends all his time with the sheep; cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. \r\n\r\nNow, Latif wants to expand his business and buy more sheep, so he has applied for a loan of 2000 Somoni ($600 USD). He promises to repay the loan within 12 months and thanks all lenders for their support. With your help, Latif can get ahead.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with two children. Four years ago, Bahodur started to use his mechanical skills to do work for his neighbors and acquaintances. He learned this skill at another shop and practiced until he had the opportunity to start his own business. \r\n\r\nWith his faith and enthusiasm, his auto mechanic business started to grow little by little. Villagers who use machines for their business always come to him to have their machines repaired. Now, Bahodur is finding that the tools that he has are not enough to work at his job with full speed. For this reason, he is seeking a loan of $600 USD that will be paid back over the course of 12 months. This loan will be used to buy tools and materials used to repair autos.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Karomatullo is happy about this loan and would like to thank everyone for the trust and support.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.   Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet Republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 38-year-old Happiness M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children ages two and seven years old. Happiness has been running a pharmacy since 2001. A pharmacy in Tanzania is traditionally a small store that has many glass shelves in which a variety of medicines are displayed, from antibiotic soap to malaria medicine. She works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. She is requesting a loan of 750 USD in order to increase her inventory. Happiness thanks you for her support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":252650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-12T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Happiness ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436361,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":167375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130633,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":167375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027430,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":167375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613431,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":167375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010511,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":167374.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232807,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T08:42:56Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":82903,"name":"Marisiano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marisiano K. is 32 years old and lives in Gari Village in the Rongo District of Kenya.

Martines is 54 years old, and is a widow. Do\u00f1a Martina has 5 children. Her oldest son, 38, is self-employed. Her other son, of 34, is also self-employed. Her daughter, also 34, is in her fourth year of secondary school modules. Her son of 30, is not in his studies, and her youngest son of 28 doesn\u2019t work. Maria\u2019s intentions are to continue on with her business to support her family, given that it is difficult to maintain her current economic status because she has to support her mother and her children. Her wishes are to continue struggling to better their quality of life by transforming her house and giving her children an adequate place to live. Her dreams are to administrate a tortilla business, where she would be able to have an assistant with the production of tortillas, as her age does not allow her to spend a great deal of time on her feet. \r\nThe economic activity that Maria participates in is the production and elaboration of tortillas, and the sale of beans. The location of her business is in the annexed region, Austria. She has had her business for 4 years, starting it because she needed a means of generating income to support her family. She started with the sale of tortillas, with the initial amount of 50 kg of corn, with which she saw the results of her sacrifices. Later, she decided to establish another business in the sale of beans, which she sold for a period of time, until the price of beans as a product escalated. Later, she returned to the sale of beans because it generates the appropriate capital to buy necessary supplies like beans, corn, and wood, because investing in raw materials is necessary so that she may offer her products to her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva

Tuy S., 44, is married and has six children. Three of them are enrolled in school and three work as laborers. \r\nS. and her husband have a seasonal fruit reselling business. She has a lot of business during mango season because mangoes are very popular in Cambodia. S. and her husband travel a lot to purchase large quantities of mangoes to sell to other resellers, wholesale and retail.

is married with one child; she lives in Ndamukong, Bamenda, Cameroon. She had already successfully taken out and repaid loans to cultivate crops and rear livestock.  She is now asking for a loan to buy a motorbike. The motorbike will be used as a taxi, driven by her son who will pay her an amount of his daily earnings. Bikes are one of the most efficient forms of transport in and around Bamenda. Bikes are often able to move through damaged roads more efficiently than cars. She will continue working hard with the support of her son to improve her family's standard of living. Elizabeth also plans to take care of her family, ensure that they eat well and buy their medication. She is confident that she will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the lengthy repayment period.  \r\n \r\nThis is Elizabeth\u2019s fifth loan; she has been a Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) member since 2003. The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and the alleviation of poverty through a multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, and family values.  Clients are also required to put a small amount of their earnings into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":253049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of Motorbike, fuel and Documents","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ndamukong, Bamenda, NW.

She plans to invest this loan in a motorbike. In the past she has taken out loans to sell vegetables, and do crops and pig farming. The motorbike will be used as a taxi in the area. She has already found a driver (her son) for her bike who will pay her at the end of each day. <P>\r\n \r\nThis is Beltha\u2019s fifth loan; she has been a GHAPE member since 2003.  Bikes are one of the most efficient forms of transport in and around Bamenda.  As many of the roads are in shambles, bikes are often able to move through these areas quicker and without suffering as much damage as cars.  Beltha will continue her profitable firewood business for extra income.  <P>\r\n\r\nRecently Beltha was very upset when her husband sold their only piece of land. And he also married another lady and stopped paying school fees for their son. Beltha is ready to build her life back with loans from GHAPE and collaboration from her son. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Beltha plans to repair her family house.  She also plans to take care of her family, pay school fees, ensure that they eat well, and buy their medication.  She knows she will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the lengthy repayment period.<P>\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":253050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Purchase of a motorbike, fuel, and paying for documents","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

on the 28th December 1968, Winifred is married with five children; she lives in Musang, a quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon.  She intends to invest this loan in her motorbike transport business.  She plans to purchase a motor bike and fuel and pay for the documents with her loan of 500,000 cfa.<P>\r\n  \r\nWinifred has been a GHAPE client since September 9th, 2003 and this is her fifth loan. She has seen that there is a high demand in her community for transport and this is her second time in the motorbike business. She plans to contribute to her community by transporting residents to various destination of their choice. <P>\r\n\r\nThis loan will help her financial situation by providing her with a quick turnover investment and high profits through her motorbike transport business. Moreover, Winifred sells vegetables in  the food market in Bamenda to cover daily family expenses when there less work for motorbikes.   <P>\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan, Winifred plans to pay for her daughter to enroll in the university and construct her own house. She also will make sure her family eats well and stays healthy.  Finally, she hopes to place much of her profit into her personal savings account that GHAPE provided for her.  She is happy to be taking out another loan with GHAPE, and she knows her success will be greater with each loan as she receives more business and life skills training from GHAPE.  <P>\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":253065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Buying a motor bike, fuel, and the documents for the motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

S. was born in 1957 and is a widow. She currently lives in Siem Reap Province. She has two children, both of whom are employed and earn money to help meet with family's living expenses. \r\n\r\nSince 2004, Sam has run a business selling fish in local Kompong Kdei Market, and is currently earning an average of $2 each day. She uses her own old bicycle for her business activities.

Moussa has requested a loan of $1000 US dollars from Al Majmoua to purchase gel, bags, necklaces, perfumes and other accessories for men. This is the first time that Moussa has requested a loan.\r\n\r\nMoussa is special in his field, because his workplace is clean, his work is good, and he is fast. His clients are his friends, family members and neighbors. When he first started his business, he lacked cash, which made him borrow money. Now, thanks to his work, he has been able to use his business income to repay his loan. \r\n\r\nMoussa decided to be a barber, because he learned it in a academy, and he gained experience in one of

He is 40 years old, married, but does not have children.  He also lives together with his parents and supports the entire family, since neither his wife nor other family members work.  Living in their mountainous district makes for very hard conditions.  To feed his family, Nasrullo repairs automobiles and has been in this business for 5 years.  He wants to obtain this loan in order to purchase auto parts for his business.  This would also allow him to start selling auto parts and increase profit for his family.  He will repay the loan within 10 months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

Everyone in his family works: women work at home, and men at the market.  They purchase young calves, feed and grow them and then sell them.

He has to fatten pigs and the food that he gives them to eat is very expensive but he would like to keep fattening pigs.  His wishes are that he can improve his home so his wife and sons can live comfortably and his sons can have a good place for the future.  He dreams of buying a house in Le\u00f3n where he could take his family on vacation, as his current home is in the Ch\u00e1caraseca region.\r\n\r\nGerm\u00e1n works fattening pigs and raising chickens.  His business is located in his home in the Ch\u00e1caraseca region, and he has had the business for 10 years.  He began with another business before starting his current business.  In his previous business, he was a truck driver who transported TIP-TOP poultry.  He began with 10 chickens, and because he is a hard-working person, he also began with two pigs and wanted to invest in more pigs.  He continued buying pigs until he had 30 in total, and this was how, little by little, he increased his production until he had what he has now.

K.

Trunks are mostly purchased by parents who have their wards in the boarding house because it is safe and secure to keep your goods in them. Joseph said business is doing very well due to the strategic location he founds himself in the market but he is refusing to be complacent. Joseph is worried about the frequent increases in the price of raw materials retarding his business progress. However, he is convinced that with the loan he can buy stock of materials like steel, paints, rods, metals and others to increase his inventory. He believes this would help him even in the face of high prices in the cost of raw materials. <p>\r\n\r\nJoseph is pleading for your assistance to realize his dream for giving his children a better education for their future prospects. He also believes the loan would help him to buy machines for the cutting of the metals, to ease the stress he goes through.
