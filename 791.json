She has specialized product catalogs which she uses to promote and sell her products.  Teresa will make a successful investment with her Kiva loan because she sells to order.

She earns a minimum of 200 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Mary Jane is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and then sell that merchandise for a small profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothing and other similar products. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Aside from this, she sells cell phone loads for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy RTW products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRona hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years.

She is not afraid of work and is always happy seeing the positive side of life.  She is married to Arturo, who is 28 years old, and they have two children, Gino who is 17 and Ingrid who is 15.  Jessica lives beside her family in her own home and works hard daily since she wants to bring her family a better quality of life.  Jessica's job consists of selling food.  Early in the morning she goes to the market looking for the freshest ingredients and the most select items in order to bring forth a good product.  Once she returns home she prepares everything and goes out to sell to her clients who are very loyal since they know that her flavors are good and she treats her clients the best.  She does all of this work on her own at home.  She has been doing this work for one year.  Before that she worked selling groceries but that job was never-ending.  She likes what she does now since it permits her to have some free time.  It is going well for her as she is generating good income for her family.  Her plans for the future include opening a restaurant in her house, but she knows it is a process that will take a long time so for now she just wants to continue consolidating and growing a little bit the variety of dishes that she offers to her customers.  This will be her third credit with MFP, and she is hoping that with your help she will be able to reach her goals.  For her part, she promises to complete her scheduled payments and continue being a punctual group member like she was with her previous credit.  With the first loan she met other members of the communal bank and she knows that they are all very responsible and committed, and for that reason she is very happy to belong to such a good group.  With the requested loan of 2000 Peruvian soles, she will buy non-perishable ingredients, so that she will have them in stock, since during the rainy season like right now prices go up a lot and don't allow for good earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":113.25,"image":{"id":1007551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy perishable ingredients and imperishable items for the preparation of food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":301.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":318.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":317.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":342.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":355.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":364.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":113.25,"local_amount":301.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":304.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386554,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T14:27:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395298,"name":"Hawasatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawasatu is a seamstress who sells fabrics in Krofofordo near Abura.

She has always lived alongside Armando, her husband, with whom she has worked to be able to offer a good education and upbringing to their children. Many years ago, Reyna had a good and prosperous business selling groceries. She had a very large and well-stocked store. Unfortunately, she had an illness that left her bedridden for a long time and so her business fell and she could no longer run it. As a result, 18 years ago, she decided to start a new business, one that she wouldn't have to work at all the time, but rather one that would enable her to rest. This is how she started to work in her new business that, at the start, she only did at the weekends. With time, she started working on alternating days. She works selling patasca (a soup from the mountains). In our city, there are many people from this part of out country and they very often go in search of dishes that are prepared the way that they like, with good seasoning and well made. She has been running this new business for 18 years and her husband helps her. \r\nThe business is going very well and she has good sales that bring her a good income. For the future, she'd like to grow her business and make a greater variety of dishes and so better serve her customers. This will be her fourth loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support as she feels more sure that she can move her business forward.

She was widowed 8 years ago. Since that time she has taken care of her seven children, of whom only three live with her: Rocio, Junior, and Jack. They live in their own house, located in the town of Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez.\r\n\r\nShe works tirelessly and takes advantage of every opportunity that is presented to her. Her principal agricultural activity is planting corn and potatoes on her own agricultural land. As she has few parcels, she plants on a small scale. But this does not discourage her. She knows that she has to advance for her children. For this reason, during the agricultural season she works as a laborer on other plantings, where they pay her a daily amount of money. But, as she is an ingenious woman, she buys animals such as sheep and pigs, which she fattens and sells in the market that takes place in her city on Sundays. She also sells her harvests, and in this way she obtains a larger income. \"I can't be without doing anything, I have to work on something,\" she mentions. For this reason she also knits wool sweaters with her own hands. This is going very well, and a number of people have placed orders with her. In addition, she works on government projects in her district, where they pay her a monthly salary.

Now she embroiders at home where she can comfortably take care of the house and attend to her children.  She also grows alfalfa which she sells wholesale.  She has no fixed work schedule but is constantly embroidering because the complexity of the work and thickness of the design on the fabric means it takes up to a month to make a typical garment admired by her customers which they buy and pay for in cash.

The couple have three children who they care for in their own home in the town of Yacuraquina.\r\n\r\nJulia started working as a very good farmer but she always dreamed of being a saleswoman and having her own business.  The farm work was tiring and sometimes she suffered many losses as the bad weather would make her lose crops.  For this reason, she saved up the money she needed to open a business buying and selling clothing in different sizes, colors and price-ranges.  She sells these products in her own village.  During the week, she travels to a nearby city where she buys fashionable clothing and takes it back to her village.  Owing to the distance, this is not an easy journey to make and there are no clothing stores in her village.  This means that her business does very well.  Julia's husband works providing a public transport service in a motorcycle taxi that he acquired a short time ago.  During the day he transports local people from Pampas to different places in the area.\r\n\r\nNow Julia would like to increase her capital and buy new clothing for her business.

In the mornings Daysi sells meals like juanes [seasoned rice wrapped in a green bijao leaf], chicken soup, soft drinks, etc.  She has a stand set up in front of a business where lots of local teachers pass by and she provides them with great service starting very early.\r\n\r\nDaysi started out more than four years ago with a private loan that allowed her to get her ingredients and so far she has worked with the support of her daughter, who serves customers.  Daysi feels her business is sufficiently profitable because it provides healthy profits and a busy location.  She decided to start her business because she had an accident on the river in which she lost the boat she used for her transportation service and she needed to have income to support the family.  So now, given the good results she's getting, she wants to keep and maintain her business.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Daysi's second loan with MFP.  She's very glad to know that she'll get financial support because it will make her feel secure in moving ahead with her business.  She plans to invest the 1500 soles in ingredients for meals.  Prices are going up so she'll look for better prices to increase  profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":46.64,"image":{"id":1007668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and supplies for food preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daysi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":164.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":177.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.64,"local_amount":121.66,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":125.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T23:38:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395376,"name":"Ruslan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruslan is 27 years old and he is married.

He wants to have a shoemaking business.  He lives with Narjil, a housewife and the mother of their three children: Dais, 18, Dayana, 15, and Luz, 14.  Together they live in the comfort of their own home, which they managed to buy through mutual support. \r\n\r\nThe work Miguel does is shoe repair, a job he learned by taking classes and training workshops while he was working in a shoemaking business in another city.  He does his work in a small rented space at the entrance to a shoe store, where he gives his customers quick and friendly service and is very much in demand.  He began three years ago with his own capital, buying a sewing machine for shoemaking, and has worked alone up to the present.  He considers his business quite profitable because of the profits it yields him.  He also saw the opportunity to generate income for himself, because this service was scarce in that area.\r\n\r\nBefore starting his business he had financial problems because he was unemployed.  Besides liking the work, he looked for alternatives to be able to support his family.  Consequently, seeing the profits and the good results he is having now, he wants to continue his business and in the future open a shoemaking workshop.\r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan with the MFP institution, for which he hopes for your collaboration so he can continue with his goals.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 3000 PEN he will invest in buying materials to repair shoes, such as glue, thread, and others, as well as shoemaking materials such as soles, leather, and others.  He will look for low prices for buying in quantity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.63,"image":{"id":1007651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy soles, leather, thread, and glue.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T18:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T18:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":249.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":268.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":284.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":290.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":307.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":314.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":338.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":348.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.63,"local_amount":249.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":251.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T00:16:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393581,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Virginia  se dedica a el comercio de art\u00edculos del hogar (electrodom\u00e9sticos, sabanas, copas, focos y otras mercader\u00edas) hace diez a\u00f1os que se dedica a esta actividad, ofrece sus productos a distintos sectores, ya sea oficina e incluso en los mercados otorgando sus productos a cr\u00e9dito como al contado, los cuales los compra en la ciudad de Oruro y posteriormente entrega la mercader\u00eda a clientes que le hacen pedido en la ciudad de Cochabamba, vive actualmente con su esposo en domicilio de su propiedad, solicita el cr\u00e9dito para compra de mercader\u00eda como electrodom\u00e9sticos y sabanas ya que le hicieron un pedido importante y as\u00ed de esta manera poder incrementar su capital de trabajo y de esta manera  incrementar sus ventas y obtener mas ganancias, la Sra.

","en":"Kaiyrkul is 58 years old, married and raising two grandsons. Her family's primary business is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1993 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS), today yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Kaiyrkul's business has two dairy cows, five sheep and one horse.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Kaiyrkul requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep. This would allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, making the best capital investment, in her opinion.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1013609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kaiyrkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T00:09:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396475,"name":"Odinamo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0415\u0439 24 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434.","en":"Odinamo is a resident of the city of Kulob.

Deris ha logrado capitalizar su negocio poco a poco, pero invirtiendo todo lo que se gana en \u00e9l y esto es lo que planea seguir haciendo, para continuar su crecimiento. Actualmente  acude a su credikiva para lograr un nuevo capital de trabajo, comprar mercanc\u00eda en descuento y en mayor volumen y lograr aumentar sus  utilidades,  mejorando el tiempo de respuesta de los pedidos que hacen sus clientes. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es tener un gran almac\u00e9n en la plaza de Puerto Colombia, municipio donde habita,  ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe y del que ella disfruta su naturaleza, su tradicion y su gente.","en":"Deris has a variety store where she sells varied merchandise and also sells products through specialized catalogues.Deris is a young 21-year-old. After finishing her bachelor's degree and finding it impossible to get a job, she decided to sell merchandise through a catalogue. Gradually, when her business started to grow, she put together a small store (which belongs to her sister) and stocked it with other merchandise which she began displaying in display cases. This has gone very well for her. Her mother helps her by working in the store while Deris delivers products. Deris currently has clothing and accessories in stock, but she plans to expand her stock with school supplies; she has done a pre-sale and has orders. Deris has been able to invest in her business bit by bit, but only through investing all of her income in it. She plans to continue doing so in order to continue expanding her business. She has turned to Kiva in order to gain new working capital. She will buy a large quantity of merchandise at a discount and expand her stock. This will improve her order response time. Her greatest dream is to have a large store in the plaza of Puerto Colombia, the municipality where she lives. Puerto Colombia is located on the shores of the Caribbean, and Deris enjoys the nature, traditions, and the people."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to invest in school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-23T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-24T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91667},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T22:45:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395417,"name":"Igbal","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Igbal vladeet malenkim produktovim magazinom.
