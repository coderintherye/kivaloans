The group is currently on their third cycle of Fundacion Paraguaya's Entrepreneurial Women program; each woman currently receives an average of 943,000 guaran\u00eds (US$231). \r\n<p>\r\nThe first committee meetings were held in the home of Mrs. Marilyn C.. 22 interested women showed up to the group's first meeting. Then, in the second group meeting, 18 women agreed to sign up and take on the benefits and the responsibilities inherent in the program. Today, they hold weekly meetings whenever possible. It is difficult to find a regular time when they are all free to meet, since most of them are ambulatory vendors and work very long hours, beginning very early in the morning and finishing very late at night. \r\n<p>\r\nThough this committee is one of the newest formed at the Caacup\u00e9 office, the women are already doing all sorts of extra work in order to make contributions to their group savings account. This account is very important, and will be used if any of the committee members has to pay for emergency hospitalizations or medications, or to help women make their repayments so that they do not fall behind. \r\n<p>\r\nEach woman will invest her share of the loan to purchase merchandise or raw materials for the particular products she sells.\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva volunteer.\r\n<p>\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 integrado por 18 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras del barrio Santa Lucia de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, la mayor\u00eda de ellas poseen despensas, otras kioscos, ventas de ropa y ventas de chipa (comida t\u00edpica del Paraguay).El grupo se encuentra actualmente en el 3er.

Farmers from the surrounding villages bring their small annual harvests to the market at Solola to sell.\r\n\r\n<p>Members of this group invest their money in different businesses. For example, there are women who buy yarns for making traditional fabrics. Others buy threads to use in embroidering beautiful Maya designs in traditional clothing. There are also women who invest their money in the purchase and resale of clothing, animal husbandry, and meal preparation. There is even a woman who spends her money on maintaining her \u201cmoto-taxi\u201d (motorcycle taxi).\r\n \r\n<p>This group of women does believe in the opportunities that the loans provide. To begin with, they believe that without these loans they could never have started their businesses, since their own capital was never sufficient to generate any profit. At a more personal level, many of these women have large families and the income they earn complements that of their husbands\u2019, which is generally insufficient to support the entire family.\r\n \r\n<p>These women dream of helping their children study and attend school (and why not university?) and be able to attend school themselves.

Most of the women sell clothing, while others sell jewelry, sweets, chipas (a traditional Paraguayan food, similar to bread) and jams. Guayaba is the most popular flavor of jam; other flavors include strawberry, orange and custard apple. \r\n<p>\r\nAll of the committee members are neighbors; they are currently on their seventh cycle in the Entrepreneurial Women program run by Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya. The group was formed thanks to the efforts of Mrs. Zulma B., the group's coordinator, who provided the venue for and organized the first committee meetings. Each woman will receive an average of 882,000 guaran\u00eds (US$216).\r\n<p>\r\nThis group of women is very organized. They perform all of their work very harmoniously, which means that their efforts are always successful. With each additional task that the women perform, they receive extra money for their group savings account. Each woman is very punctual in making repayments and attends a weekly informational group meeting. If one of them misses a meeting without good reason, she will be fined. The women came up with this policy on their own and unanimously agreed on its implementation.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, the women are looking for another group loan in order to invest in their various individual commercial activities and buy raw materials to make their products. Among the products to be purchased are fruits like guayabas, custard apples, apples, oranges, dulce de leche, sugar, extracts, starch, cheese, flour, clothing (jerseys, pants, shirts) and jewelry (earrings, rings).\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva volunteer\r\n<p>\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 17 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras del barrio Centro de la ciudad de San Bernardino, la mayor\u00eda de las integrantes de este comit\u00e9 se dedica a la venta de ropas, otras venden joyas, otras  elaboran y venden chipas (comida t\u00edpica de nuestro pa\u00eds bastante consumida parecido al pan), otras dulces y mermeladas de frutas como guayaba que es la m\u00e1s vendida, frutilla, mam\u00f3n, naranja, etc.\r\n<p>\r\n Todas las integrantes son vecinas del mismo barrio y actualmente est\u00e1n en el 7 ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras que maneja la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.  Actualmente reciben un promedio de Gs. 882.000 por personas. El grupo se form\u00f3 gracias a la se\u00f1ora Zulma B. quien fue la coordinadora del grupo y la que facilit\u00f3 el local y los medios para realizar las primeras  reuniones del comit\u00e9.\r\n<p>\r\nEste grupo de mujeres se caracteriza por ser muy organizado, cada actividad que realizan la llevan a cabo con mucha armon\u00eda lo que les proporciona siempre de un \u00e9xito seguro. Con cada actividad extra que realizan ellas obtienen un dinero extra para su ahorro grupal. Ellas son muy puntuales en sus pagos, y todas asisten a las reuniones informativas que se realizan semanalmente; la ausencia injustificada de alguna de las integrantes recibe una amonestaci\u00f3n, esto es, una pol\u00edtica implementada por ellas y para la cual todas se pusieron de acuerdo en acatar.\r\n<p>\r\nEllas hoy desean adquirir un cr\u00e9dito nuevo para poder invertirlo en sus actividades comerciales individualmente y comprar mercader\u00edas y materia prima para elaborar sus productos. Entre los productos a adquirir citamos: frutas diversas como guayabas, mamones, manzanas, naranjas, dulce de leche, az\u00facar, esencias, almid\u00f3n, queso, harina, leche, ropas y joyas para la venta como remeras, pantalones, camisas, pulseras, aros, anillos, etc.\r\n<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3750,"image":{"id":165670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase clothing, gold and silver jewelry, starch, cheese, vegetable oil, sugar, fruit, milk, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-06-11T16:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"In\u00e9s","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salvadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Evangelista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-14T15:30:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":15000000,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3750000},{"due_date":"2008-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3750000},{"due_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3750000},{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":938,"local_amount":3752000,"processed_date":"2008-08-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3770760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282762,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":938,"local_amount":3752000,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3770760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":312826,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":938,"local_amount":3752000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-02T07:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3770760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344009,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":936,"local_amount":3744000,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3762720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318177,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-06-30T15:30:32Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T04:54:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":50666,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Angelina is 42 years old and married to Mr. Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, who is 46.

K. decided to start business buying and selling goats, pigs, cocoa yams and fowl.  Until now, he had been making healthy profits in the retailing business which has helped him take care of his child. Motivated by the need of business capital and to be with people, he became a member of GHAPE in 2001, where he was trained in business and marketing techniques, So far he has successfully obtained and repaid loans five times from GHAPE, worth a total of $640.\r\n\tGiven a loan he plans to continue in his retail.

Her desire is to work for her children\u2019s education and pay for their apprenticeships so that they may learn a trade. She decided to become a member of GHAPE due to her inability to get investment capital, which could give her higher income to meet her children\u2019s needs.

This investment will help people in her community to travel from one location to the other. She will also retail her goods to the public which will greatly help the poor who will not have to travel as far to acquire their daily needs. She is planning on using the profits generated to sponsor her children in school.

was born in 1949. He is married and a father of four children who are all above the age of 15. Despite being born into poverty, lacking education, and losing his parents at an early age, Emmanual aims to become a very rich man and give his children the good education they need to get ahead.\t\r\n       E. became a member of GHAPE in 2006 and has successfully repaid two loans. He invested his loans to sell maize and bought a maize mill which produces flour.\r\n\r\nE. started farming crops in 1975, and recently starteed buying and renting a few houses around his neighborhood. In the two years since joining GHAPE, he has dramatically increased his fortunes. His first loan helped him to buy his first corn mill (which costs about 350,000 CFA or $875), and the second loan from Kiva, together with his profits from previous business, helped him to buy his second corn mill. Corn mills are in demand in every community around Bamenda, as corn is sold in kernels and every person must take their corn to be milled before they can prepare \u201ccorn fufu\u201d \u2013 a local favorite. \r\n\r\nI asked E. how he is able to farm and operate mills in two locations, and like a modern-day businessman, he operates from a distance. He pays the rent for two shops in two busy markets and hires two young men to operate the mills. With the two mills now operating, he says he is able to earn as much as 100,000 CFA ($250) per month. \r\n\r\nHis profits from the mills have allowed him to expand his business activities into livestock. Since starting the second mill, he has been able to purchase three piglets and two cattle. His dream for the future is to start a full cattle farm. He says that he already has enough land for a herd of fifty cattle, and he has recently obtained two required grazing permits. A future loan will enable him to begin to build his herd.\r\n\r\nE.\u2019s income allows him and his wife, a civil servant working with the government, to give their four children an enviable education. His eldest is studying in a university in France, made possible in part by a scholarship. Two others are in university in Cameroon. And the youngest is in secondary school. Between the four, E. and his wife pay over 500,000 CFA ($1,250) in annual school fees and expenses. \r\n\r\nE. says that without his new business ventures, he and his wife would really be struggling with the expense of providing their children with such an income. Thus, he is very grateful to those who have financed his loan: \u201cIt is a pleasure to learn that so many around the world are contributing to my family\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he says, \u201cand we send them our thanks.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe plans to repay this loan in 18 months and the first installment repayment begins four months after disbursement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":165957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a

Manov lives in the Varzob region.

Because his salary is quite limited, Abdusoleh and his large family need to be occupied in agriculture. He owns a small piece of land, which he uses to plant potatoes. At this point, he needs to purchase natural fertilizers so he could grow good qulity crops.

This community is located in a rural area within the Department of Solol\u00e1.  The most common crops grown in the community are corn and potatoes.  The residents are indigenous and the vast majority of them wear traditional clothing.  The women can be seen walking around the town wearing short or long skirts and huipiles\u2014traditional blouses made of handmade fabric\u2014or embroidered blouses.  Many of the men wear Western clothing, though some of them still wear traditional clothing.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the bank sell traditional clothing for a living.  Selling traditional clothing in the rural areas is a lucrative business because there is much demand for it, especially among women.<p>\r\n\r\nSome of the women in the group are going to invest their loans in other types of businesses, including a shoe store, a furniture store, a tortilla shop, and a shop that sells poultry.  The Brisas de Cienega Grande group includes a variety of non-traditional businesses.  This can be a factor that helps the women\u2019s business development in the communal bank, since all of them share their experiences with their various businesses.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the women said that things were going well with their respective businesses.  When asked about competition, they said that it was present, but that it did not prevent their businesses from being successful.  The women who sell traditional clothing mentioned that all of their products are sold within the community.<p>\r\n\r\nThe members of the Brisas Cienega Grande group say that they enjoy working in a communal bank, mainly because they would not have been able to obtain a loan otherwise.  They also enjoy working together because they know each other well and know that they all have excellent credit records.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother factor that makes this group unique is that all of the women are able to support their children\u2019s education, and all of them send their children to school.  While it might seem like this should be the rule, this is unfortunately not the case in Guatemala, where the illiteracy rate is very high.  These women are thus helping their country to develop not just economically, but also socially.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Chris Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas mujeres de este banco comunal provienen de la comunidad Cienega Grande.

Esto puede ser un factor que ayude al desarrollo de las empresarias dentro del banco comunal porque todas intercambian experiencias de sus distintos negocios. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de se\u00f1oras comentaban que les iba bien con sus respectivos negocios. Cuando se les pregunt\u00f3 sobre la competencia, ellas dijeron que si estaba presente pero no era un gran inconveniente para el \u00e9xito de sus negocios. Las se\u00f1oras que venden ropa t\u00edpica comentaron que todos sus productos se venden dentro de su comunidad. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Brisas Cienega Grande dicen que les gusta trabajar en un banco comunal, principalmente porque de otra manera ellas no hubieran podido sacar un pr\u00e9stamo. Tambi\u00e9n les gusta trabajar en conjunto porque todas se conocen bien y saben que todas tienen un record crediticio excelente. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro factor que hace a este grupo \u00fanico es que todas las se\u00f1oras realmente apoyan a la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Todas mandan a sus hijos al colegio. Aunque al parecer esta deber\u00eda de ser la regla, no es la realidad de Guatemala. Los \u00edndices de analfabetismo son alt\u00edsimos. Es por eso que estas mujeres no solo ayudan al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico del pa\u00eds, sino al social tambi\u00e9n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":166073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Having gained a lot of experience working with her mother, she decided to start her own business. In the beginning, she lacked the funds to do so, so she joined a group that received a loan from Soro Yiriwaso. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full. With this loan, she would like to purchase women\u2019s clothing, shoes, handbags and undergarments, cosmetics, perfumes, sheets, bedspreads and other items. Her shop is located in downtown S\u00e9gou, 100 meters from the market in her neighborhood, M\u00e9dine. This is a busy neighborhood, and many women of all ages come to her shop. She purchases supplies monthly in Bamako. Mrs. H. Koudedia Tour\u00e9 travels there by bus and spends 6,000 CFA francs on average for the trip. She generally sells items for cash and makes an average profit of 35% on each item she sells, thus earning a monthly income of 50,000 CFA francs. With this income, she repays the interet on her loan, builds her business and pays her children\u2019s and family\u2019s expenses.

As you can see in the photo, all of the members are Kachikel Maya.  The Kachikel Maya are one of Guatemala\u2019s largest indigenous groups.  The native language of the members is Kachikel, though the women can also speak Spanish perfectly.  This is because they live in an area where there is much business and they interact with both indigenous people and Spanish speakers.<p>\r\n\r\nThere are some successful businesswomen in the Tzolojya communal bank.  Citibank awarded one of them with a prize for the best woman-owned small business in Guatemala for 2007.  She makes beaded jewelry for a living.    At the moment she has the help of five other artisans who support her in her business.<p>\r\n\r\nThe participating members invest their loans in different areas.  For example, there are businesswomen who invest their loan in purchasing American, Guatemalan, or traditional clothing for resale in Solol\u00e1.  Others invest in their tortilla shops.  Tortillas are a basic staple of the Guatemalan diet, so there is always much demand for them.  One woman purchases vegetables in the Solol\u00e1 market, rents a pick-up truck, and then goes to Quich\u00e9 to sell the produce.  Another woman gets up very early in the morning to buy vegetables from the farmers in the market and then sells the vegetables during the course of the day.  One member makes approximately a thousand tamales and chuchitos (small Guatemalan tamales) a day, which she sells on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of the women dreams of seeing her business grow to the point where it will generate sufficient income for her to open a retirement account at the bank.  Many other members wish for their businesses to grow so that they will have the income to support their children\u2019s development.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Chris Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas integrantes del grupo Tzolojya provienen de la cabecera departamental de Solol\u00e1. Como se puede ver en la foto, todas las integrantes son Mayas- Kachikeles. Los Mayas- Kachikeles es uno de los grupos ind\u00edgenas m\u00e1s numerosos de Guatemala. La lengua materna de las integrantes es el Kachikel, sin embargo las se\u00f1oras se comunican perfectamente en el espa\u00f1ol. Esto se debe a que viven en un \u00e1rea donde hay mucho comercio y se mezclan ind\u00edgenas y hispano hablantes. \r\n\r\n<P>En el banco comunal Tzolojya uno puede encontrar empresarias ex\u00edtosas. Una de ellas gan\u00f3 el premio otorgado por el Citibank a la mejor micro empresaria de Guatemala del a\u00f1o 2007. Ella se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de joyas de mostacilla. Por el momento ella cuenta con la ayuda de cinco otras artesanas que la apoyan con su negocio. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientes participantes invierten sus cr\u00e9ditos en distintas \u00e1reas. Por ejemplo hay empresarias que invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de ropa americana, Guatemalteca o t\u00edpica para su reventa en Solol\u00e1. Otras invierten en sus tortiller\u00edas. Las tortillas es un alimento b\u00e1sico de la dieta de la poblaci\u00f3n Guatemalteca, es por eso que tienen una mucha demanda. Hay una se\u00f1ora que compra las verduras en el mercado de Solol\u00e1, alquila un pick up, y se va a vender sus productos al Quiche. Otra se\u00f1ora se levanta muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana le compra las verduras a los agricultores en el mercado y vende las verduras durante el transcurso del d\u00eda. Una de las clientas produce aproximadamente mil tamales y chuchitos al d\u00eda y estos los vende todos los martes, viernes y domingo. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de una de las clientas es el de ver sus negocios crecer al punto donde este pueda generar los suficientes ingresos para que ella pueda abrir una cuenta de pensiones en el banco. El sue\u00f1o de muchas de las clientas es el de que su negocio crezca para que con los ingresos ellas puedan apoyar el desarrollo de sus

($69 approximately) minimum for rent, an amount they work very hard to reach. They dream with buying their own house for their children. There are several activities on the association, like bread production, bed sheets and clothing production, which is the main one. They usually sell their products on credit, so they need to have capital for production. Short time ago they received an order to produce uniforms for a bank, so they are soliciting a loan in order to buy materials to produce them. They want to increase their income to get financial stability for their homes and save money enough to buy their own house some day.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by N.D., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEn la zona de Alto Lima de la ciudad de El Alto, junto a Pro-Mujer trabaja la asociaci\u00f3n Kurmi, todos con la esperanza de tener actividades propias que les brinde mejores oportunidades de vida, el grupo esta formado por 13 miembros activos, que trabajan junto a Pro-Mujer hace mas dos a\u00f1os, demostrando ser muy organizados y responsables en sus actividades de grupo. <br><br>\r\nCasi todos con sus familias por lo general entre de alquiler de vivienda, mensualmente gastan 500 Bs. m\u00ednimos, monto que lo consiguen con mucho esfuerzo, ellos sue\u00f1an en comprar una casa propia para sus hijos,\r\nExisten diversos negocios dentro la asociaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de pan, confecci\u00f3n de Edredones y sabanas, pero la confecci\u00f3n y venta de ropa  viene a ser la actividad principal.

This woman is also responsible for the care of a 35 years old handicapped brother. \r\n<p>Ms. M. is requesting a loan to improve her house, more specifically to replace the kitchen roof and a partition in the living room, which is in bad shape and needs to be rebuilt with better materials. In this way, she hopes to provide greater comfort to her children, grandchild, son in law and the rest of the family. \r\n<p>She has used prior loans towards the same purpose, having installed electricity, drinking water and the first partition of the living room. As she is a single mother without any support, she will continue to give good use of loans to improve her home. \r\n<p>This woman is well liked amongst her coworkers, thanks to her honesty, responsibility and the good treatment she gives to all of those who ask for her help as human resources staff.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa Sra.

Marculino is married and has five children, all of whom attend school. In addition to his immediate family, he also supports a nephew, who lives with him.\r\n\r\nMarculino studied until 4th grade and had to stop due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. In 1984 he moved to the capital city of Maputo to search for a job and worked first as a fisherman, and later at CFM, the Mozambican Railway Company. Marculino decided to move to Catembe, a fishing village that is a 10-minute ferry boat ride away from Maputo, as the cost of life was significantly lower than in the capital. He started working with commerce and has never stopped.\r\n\r\nHe has a small general store near Catembe\u2019s central market, where he sells mainly food and basic needs products. He works daily from 8:30 am to 7:00 pm and relies on the help of his eldest daughter when she is not in school. Marculino\u2019s most sold products are rice, sugar and cigarettes. He daily earnings range between MTn 1,500 to MTn 2,000, but he is still not saving as he has a large family to support.\r\n\r\nMarculino is an old client of Hluvuku. This MTn 15,095 loan will be used to buy merchandise in large quantity and increase his stock. Marculino intends to buy mainly rice, sugar, oil and cigarettes. He hopes to attract more clients and increase his daily sales. In the future, Marculino would like to see his general store profits improve and, potentially, build a new store and offer many more products for his clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":167032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase
