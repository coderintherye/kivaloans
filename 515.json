To make a living, Aida owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business.

Aida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Aida is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sell them piecemeal with a small profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other items. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarivic dreams to be able to give her all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nNenita hopes that her business will continue to succeed. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Robert H., a retiree, and father to their child. By the grace of God, Susan has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susan, as she herself has been a college graduate (she has a Bachelor of Science in Education) and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSusan operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sell them piecemeal with a little profit.  Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, frozen foods, etc. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a loan for Php 10,000. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nSusan hopes that her child will graduate soon and have a stable job.

is Bernadette T., age 44 and resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Damaso T., a vendor, and together they have four children, all of whom are managing the household and helping her with the business. By the grace of God, Bernadette has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nBernadette operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies in wholesale price and selling them at piecemeal rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php12, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more supplies of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. <p>\r\n \r\nJennifer dreams of giving both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her businesses.

What she basically does is to buy electronic cellular phone load in huge amounts then retail it to the customer. Profit is generated depending on the network's policy of dealership. She may buy 3,000 PHP worth of load for 2,500 PHP, where she already has a 500 PHP profit, depending on promos and quota set by the networks. Angie is also currently readying a few pigs for slaughter and operating a buy-and-sell business with a variety of products.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products to be incorporated into her buy-and-sell inventory. She will also invest some of the loan to buy electronic load from different local networks. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nAngie hopes to be able to give her all her children a good quality education through all her hard work on her business.

C. is from the village of Ricoro, Gingoog City. She is 33 years old. Elda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Elda owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products, such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods and snack foods in the local community. Elda has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Elda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like biscuits and snack foods. This will be the third loan taken out by Elda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue she generates to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Marcelino P. Jr. is from the Barangay of Carmen Annex, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. He is 51 years old, married and has been blessed with five children, four of whom are now adults, while the other one is still school-aged. To make a living, he is presently operating a boarding house. He has been engaged in this kind of business for three years already. He is earning an average monthly income of about 10,000 PHP from the rentals of this business. \n\nJust this year, Marcelino joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marcelino, as a newly recognized member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP as his first loan availment, which will be used for boarding house repairs and renovations. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family, especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, loan repayments, his child\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married to Jane Wacera and they have two daughters together: Winnie, who is in secondary school, and Susan, in primary school. His business is in Kiserian town, which is well populated. He has run the business for 4 years, and his monthly profit is Kshs 19,000 with no other sources of income.\r\n\r\nSamuel was introduced to KADET by other KADET clients.

She is a cook in a local milk-producing company \u201cSut Bulak\u201d. Having worked there for a long time, she understands the whole process of dairy farming. Zina claims that the dairy process begins with taking good care of the dairy cattle.  Eight years ago, Zina and her husband, a farmer, decided to spend a month's salary on the purchase of cattle.  Although at that time 6000 Soms were enough to purchase cattle in the market, today cattle costs a large amount of money. Zina and her group applied for a Kiva loan in order to broaden their  business.

Their main concerns were the low salaries being paid, which led to a lack of teachers in schools and a low quality education for students.  Why has one of the most important professions such as teaching become one of the least paid jobs?\r\n\r\nSuidumkan B. is a leader of this group.   The low salary for teachers made it inevitable for her to start her own  business. In 2000, Suidumkan and her husband, a forester, applied for a loan at a local bank.  The 20,000 soms loan and some of her savings allowed Suidumkan to start a business in cattle breeding. The family business gave them the opportunity to purchase a car  \u2013 an old Russian \u201cJiguli\u201d  model, which helped cut some  transportation expenses.  Unfortunately, 3000 soms of monthly income is too little, so they applied for this loan in order to purchase 12 heads of cattle.  \r\n\r\nSuidumkan and her group is thankful to Kiva and all lenders, who are not indifferent to changing their lives. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

There are many ways for a customer to get from point A to point B. The most wide-spread is a mini-bus, which can seat 12 people. There are also many trolleys, buses, and city cabs.  In order to make a living, many offer a private cab service, where a customer and a cab driver can negotiate the price.\r\n\r\nAigul K., 43, is a leader of this group. Her husband, like many others, works as a private cab driver.  Aigul appreciates her husband\u2019s hard work and tries to make her own contribution to the family budget. Aigul has a dairy cow, which can yield 20-30 liters of milk per day. She delivers fresh milk to customers.  In 15 years, this has turned into a very promising business. \r\n\r\nThey have four children.  Her daughter was accepted into medical school and Aigul is very happy for her daughter\u2019s future.  Aigul earns a monthly profit of 8800 soms from her business, which goes to buying food for the cattle. Aigul and her group applied for a loan in hopes of improving their lives.

Since old times, Kyrgyz  families tended to have six or seven children. The reason for that is the strong family ties and sense of family identity of a Kyrgyz family.  And, they simply just love children. Urban families now usually stop at a third or fourth child, but rural families still follow the old Kyrgyz culture and like having big and friendly families. \r\n\r\n\r\nGulnara I. is the treasurer of this group.  She is a forty-seven-year-old resident of Kochkor, a small town in northern Kyrgyzstan.  She has a big asset:  six children. The youngest child is now a senior in high school. Gulnara proudly claims that raising six children was her greatest accomplishment. She feels fulfilled in helping them find their own place in life. \r\n\r\nGulnara and her husband are skilled farmers. They say land is always the only source of income and they cannot imagine life without farming, because it\u2019s what they have been doing their entire lives. Along with farming, the family raises and sells cattle. The family started the business fifteen years ago with only 10,000 soms. Now they have 10,000 in monthly profit.   But because of inflation, this amount is not enough to purchase additional cattle and to advance the business. Gulnara hopes to get a loan in order to promote her business. Time will show if she will be able to build the house of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\n  --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Collective farms, which worked only for the government, stopped functioning. The process of \u201cprivatization\u201d started. Families were given land according to the number of people in a family. Private businesses of cattle breeding and farming took place in the end of 20th century. Rosa I.\u2019s family also became land owners and their own story began. \r\n\r\n\r\nRosa I. is the treasurer of this group.  Rosa and her colleagues formed a group when applying for this group loan. Rosa\u2019s group members are not only close friends, but each of them is also a professional in farming. All of them are residents of a small town called Kochkor in northern Kyrgyzstan.  Fifty-two-year-old Rosa is the most experienced of the group.  She has been involved in farming for at least fifteen years. \r\n\r\nRosa is a proud mother of six sons and two daughters.  Her youngest son, a junior in college, is the only one still dependent on Rosa. Rosa and her husband, who is also a farmer, received land in 1995 and started cultivating it. This occupation brought enough revenue to purchase cattle and additional land in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.  Now the family is hoping to get this loan to purchase more cattle, and spend the proceeds on a gift for Rosa\u2019s husband:  a long-waited automobile. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a pasal, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce and milk, and staples like rice, lentils, and flour, are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profits.  By keeping lots of inventory and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

He appreciates very much those who through Kiva are able to provide him an opportunity to advance with the purchase of a cow, and he hopes they will offer their confidence once again.\r\n\r\nEmilio tells us that in the future, he wants to take out a new loan to be able to construct a stable in which he can lodge his cattle to protect them during the rainy season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":666040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"TO BUY A MILK COW","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T16:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T08:13:24Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":258392,"name":"River","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"River, de 24 a\u00f1os, es un joven muy amable y trabajador, vive en casa de sus padres junto a su esposa Gladis de 18 a\u00f1os y lo que m\u00e1s desea es mejorar su calidad de vida.

With this loan from ACCION USA, Domenic will be purchasing a new hot water heater to maintain the flow of business and increase his energy efficiency. His current hot water heater is 75 years old and incurs high energy costs as well as being much smaller then newer versions.\r\n\r\nEventually, Domenic wants to be able to purchase more stores and hire a team of employees to run his growing businesses. Watching his current business take root has inspired him to continue growing and continue to provide for the increasing number of his returning clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nAn estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. Small businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\u2019\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4666.62,"image":{"id":662302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"To

She is an entrepreneur dedicated to selling leather clothing imported from Los Angeles (USA). Roughly a year ago she became independent, opening her present business, after working for a long time as manager of a bank office, where she got to know the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, which attracted her attention, in hopes of becoming part of their micro-enterprise program. She alternates her commercial activity, serving  as an account executive, then independently, selling life insurance policies, for which she receives a commission, and next year she expects to receive her pension. \r\n\r\nLaura's micro-enterprise presently has the following financial indices: a cost of sales of 36%, a gross profit of 64%, an operating profit of 40.78% of sales value, and a net profit over sales of 29.5%.  Indications are that her liquidity can support a short-term debt. Inventory circulation is every 20 days, from the time of purchase to sales and time of payment.\r\n\r\nLaura is a woman who is dedicated to her activity and very well organized with her finances, even to the point where after many years working in a financial institution, she takes good care of her credit life.

When asked what she likes most about Pro Mujer, she responded she likes to share stories, laugh with her friends, or at times even fight and make up.\r\n\r\nRegarding her business, Elba Graciela said that she works as a blacksmith, an undertaking that she shares with her husband.  She has practiced this craft under the guidance of her husband for fourteen years and now has specialized in making rings and door knockers for wholesale.  She sells these in inland cities like ochabamba, Tarija and Sucre.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving will be used to buy iron from stores in the city.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":666285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"buying iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-12-16T04:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elba Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27777.75,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3472.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":499.99},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485285,"comment":null},{"amount":499.99,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912134,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202161095,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206221232,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211296399,"comment":null},{"amount":499.99,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216576313,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":3472.2,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746054,"comment":null},{"amount":500.02,"local_amount":3472.35,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3480.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T15:57:51Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":258446,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Juan Manuel S.

She lives with her husband and their 2 children in their own house. For over 30 years, she has worked helping her husband, who is a locksmith and maker of wrought-iron furniture, in the workshop in the front part of their home. For Elena, the days are hard work. In the mornings she prepares food for the family and the employees who work with her husband, and in the afternoons she is busy sewing: making upholstered covers for the furniture her husband makes. In this way, she is in charge of putting the finishing touches to the furniture they make, and these are well-received by her customers.

J. is from the barangay of Silongon, Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 38 years old, married and blessed with one child who is school age. To make a living, she makes choco balls and munchkins. She's been in this business for three months and earns approximately 4,200 PHP per month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. Gina has successfully repaid a loan of 5,000 PHP. She is now requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her existing choco ball and munchkin business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. She hopes to save money for future use, make loan repayments, pay for her child\u2019s education and possibly business expansions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":263.54,"image":{"id":650536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 33 years old. Luzviminda is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a business in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crispy pork skin \"chicharon\" in the local community. Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 37000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
