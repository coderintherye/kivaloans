A couple of years ago, she began selling these trinkets and clothes in an area near the city market. Gradually she has expanded her business and focused on clothing and in-demand items.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 51 years old. Asuncion is separated from her spouse and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Asuncion owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, beverages, shampoo, soap and biscuits in the local community. Asuncion has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Asuncion joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Asuncion has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Asuncion is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, snack foods and beverages. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Asuncion from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is very confident that her husband will successfully be able to improve the condition of his business.  \r\n\r\nRashida is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application to Asasah.

Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 15000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Carmelita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 17000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional vegetables like cabbages, carrots & squash. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Carmelita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Numonjon has been in this business for three years. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of $2000 USD to purchase more clothing goods.  The business is currently in its high season.  Numonjon believes that opening second retail business will give him an advantage over his competitors and provide more profits for his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 48 years old, married, and lives with his wife and four children. He grew up with agriculture, and his parents did the same work and he still works planting seeds. He grows seasonal crops on his land, working with the crops until it is time to harvest them. In addition, for extra income he raises cattle. This is his third loan from IMON International and we are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business. Yusup will buy seeds and fertilizers for his land with this loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $186 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients like meat and spices. This will be her 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

works in a very successful fabric sales business.

She was able to start this venture nine years ago, and since that time her business has done quite well. She is quite an entrepreneur and we are happy that she has chosen to apply her talents in a business that helps women be even prettier. \r\n\r\nZulfiya has requested a loan of 12,000 TJS to give her more working capital to use in her business. It will be exciting to see how Zulfiya's enterprise will continue to grow in the future as she's off to even greater success. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

age 38, is a farmer from the town of Kitale in western Kenya, where she has been farming for 15 years. Her main products are milk, maize, beans, vegetables, and tomatoes, which are all sold locally. She is also a fish vendor. She and her husband have six children between the ages of 6 and 22, four of whom are currently attending school.\r\n \r\nJoyce has applied for this loan of 31,200 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo in order to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

lives in the Kisaasi neighborhood in the city of Kampala in Uganda.  She is widowed and has 6 children, 2 of whom are in school.  She also takes care of additional family members (grandchildren).    \r\n\r\nMerina has a retail shop business which she has been running for over 10 years. She works 7 days out of every week.   She also generates additional income by renting rooms.\r\n\r\nMerina has requested a loan of 1,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more bags of sugar, cartons of salt, boxes of soap and jerry cans of cooking oil.   The main business challenges for Merina include transportation, thieves, and seasonality.

With this loan he wants to purchase new stock, groceries and cleaning materials, etc. for his store in order to be able to expand his business and accommodate more stock and thereby a greater number of customers. It is one of his dreams to own a bigger store. He is distinguished for selling different types of milk and cheese and also for his cleanliness and good prices.

For this reason, they decided to give their group the same name so that it might receive the same blessing.  The group is located in the State of Puebla, Mexico.\r\n\r\nBrenda T. is the group's treasurer.  She is 27 years old, studied up to the sixth year of elementary school, and sells shoes.  She also has a stall where she sells 'gorditas' (stuffed corn cakes).  Brenda has two children (a son and a daughter).  She started making her 'gorditas' three years ago.  Her 'gorditas' are stuffed with beans that have been cooked on a special hotplate with salsa and cheese.\r\n\r\nBrenda is requesting this loan so that she can rent business premises and also pay a couple of months' rent so that she can work more hygienically as she currently works in the corner of her home.  In addition, she would like to buy tables so that she can present a better image and provide more comfort to her diners who have congratulated her on the change that she is planning to make and for having thought of them.

She will buy dried Poblano chilis, Mulato chilis, Pasilla chilis, Guajillo chilis, sesame seeds, peanuts, almonds, raisins, seeds, cumin, pepper, cloves, chocolate, oil, plantains, etc.  She started her business three years ago.  As she makes very tasty red 'mole' chili sauce, her aunt said that she should sell red 'mole' paste and loaned her the money to buy ingredients.  Juana and her daughter go out to sell their 'mole' paste to local housewives.  People also hire her for parties so that she can prepare their 'mole' sauce.  For this reason, she likes to have in stock the supplies she needs to prepare her red 'mole' paste.\r\n\r\nJuana's business is important because it has helped her family, when they have most needed it, in covering school expenses, registration fees and uniforms.  It has also helped to cover household expenses such as electricity, gas and food bills.  Juana's dreams and hopes are for her family and her business to do better and for her to be able to leave her children something and teach them how to run their own business.\r\n\r\nHuitzililla is a village where people grow sorghum, corn and onions.

In this way she has achieved greater profits and this has helped her business, in spite of the rising price of food.  She hopes to stock non-perishable ingredients by buying in bulk to save money.  This is her first loan with MFP and she is very excited knowing she will likely have success.  She has a responsible attitude and wants to build a good credit history to achieve a greater level of trust and she is thankful for the opportunity for the loan that will help her improve her business.   She will buy food in bulk with this loan. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":265.31,"image":{"id":776326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Buy non-perishable products in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-24T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":71.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":84.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":87.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":95.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":99.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":102.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.75,"local_amount":63.33,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550362,"comment":null},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.2,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":73.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719038,"comment":null},{"amount":26.87,"local_amount":71.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":73.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350504,"comment":null},{"amount":28.78,"local_amount":76.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":79.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850987,"comment":null},{"amount":27.37,"local_amount":73.01,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":75.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666149,"comment":null},{"amount":33.16,"local_amount":88.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621268,"comment":null},{"amount":31.23,"local_amount":83.28,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":86.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835409,"comment":null},{"amount":32.56,"local_amount":86.83,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245221,"comment":null},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":93.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":96.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T17:44:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":301383,"name":"Maria Justina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, vive en casa de sus padres, ubicada en la zona urbana del distrito de Ferre\u00f1afe a unos 15 minutos de la provincia de Chiclayo.

She has been in business for four years and feels that the hardest part of her job is collecting payment for the products because the customers do not always have the cash to pay upon ordering.  But she is always able to collect all payments completely.  In the future she would like to set up a cosmetics shop so she can sell more comfortably instead of having to go door-to-door.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and she plans to use it to expand her activity.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time so she can take out future loans.  She knows she has the support of the communal bank.  She will use the 500 PEN to buy more cosmetics since she is seeing a rise in demand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":776474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-25T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550366,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719042,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350507,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850991,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666151,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":69.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621270,"comment":null},{"amount":25.2,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":69.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835410,"comment":null},{"amount":23.6,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-25T12:07:15Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":301441,"name":"Exiomara Ermelinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

This will enable her to fulfill her greatest dream: to see her children get good jobs and be successful.

Her work is very much in demand in her neighborhood as she is the only one who works in this activity.  She learned the trade from her mother when she was very young and now she has her own workshop where she serves her customers with a lot of patience.    What she most enjoys about her business is finishing off the jobs that people place with her.  She has been in this business for 12 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to work all day long when she has a very big order.  However, she is a very responsible lady and she knows that any delay could damage her reputation which she has worked so hard to achieve.  Eldencia hopes, in the future, that her business will become better known and that she will thereby be able to grow it further.  She is prepared to work very hard, without rest to achieve this.\n\nThis is Eldencia's fourth loan from MFP and she is very happy to have obtained it.  She knows that she must make her repayments on time and is prepared to do so.  She will use the 700 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy a new machine.

There he has a business where he sells drinks, soft drink and has games available, like billiards and domino. And this is where the name of the business comes from: \"Billares Domino\". Domingo started this activity because he had had previous administration experience, for several years in his birthplace. He says that it was through this business that \"doors opened\". He took advantage of the opportunities in the market, becoming independent and reaching many of his expansion goals. He is investing his Kiva loan, the first loan that he accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner), on the purchase of fruit juices, soft drinks by the box, and drinks. His goal is to supply himself and to sell in retail and to businesses who have sold out of the products. His greatest challenge is a limited capital to use for expansion, as well as the competition. For this reason he has added food sales which he can vary with the goal of attracting new clients and to continue generating an income for his family's expenses. His family is made up of his common-law wife and their two children, aged 10 and 12.

She acquired a working capital through private and very expensive loans, which have been completely cancelled today. She thought of this idea because her husband is a taxi driver and he was the only one earning an income for the family's needs. Their family is made up of them both and their 6 children, between the ages of 2 and 17. Today, Margarita generates an income which helps with the household expenses and she feels very happy to earn more every day. She currently plans on increasing her sales and she is applying for her first loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). Her Kiva loan will be used to purchase ingredients in larger quantities and to purchase tools to modernize her fried foods business. She will give a better presentation to her clients and she aspires to increase her sales profits so that they are no less than 30%.

All the members of this group are engaged in different types of sales, such as clothing, shoes, groceries and many others. \r\n\r\n<p>Rosa, a single mother, makes her home in a simple structure with her three children, who attend school. She requires a loan to buy different styles of shoes, underwear, caps, cosmetics, accessories and clothes. This is her second loan with Esperanza International. She is taking a step towards improving her business by investing this loan to increase her sales.

She is a merchant who sells candy and beverages from a street cart, Monday through Friday.  Idilia also sells jewelry from her home and on Sundays she sells olives.  Saturdays are designated for buying merchandise to stock her candy business.  She buys her merchandise at the central market in the city of Santiago since the prices are the most affordable.\r\n<p>\r\nIdilia has been in business for 20 years.  She started out selling olives and condiments.  This loan will be used to buy a cooler, merchandise to restock her business, and an awning for protection from the rain since the one she currently uses is in bad condition.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goals include selling her products from an established location, such as a kiosk, but she first needs to obtain a permit.  She also hopes that her business will prosper by adding handicrafts made of clay to her inventory.  Idilia is motivated to continue with her business and include new products.  The income she earns enables her to cover her household expenses.  She lives with her daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren.  Her goals on a personal level are to achieve a more stable socioeconomic situation and to live a more comfortable life.\r\n<p>\r\nIdilia is very grateful for the loan provided by Fondo Esperanza because the funds allow her to invest in her business and generate more income.  She says the Communal Bank meetings are very pleasant and have enabled her to form friendships with the other group members.

She also tracks her expenses, income, and the quoted prices of her purchases.  \r\n<p>\r\nIndependencia is one of the 34 communities that make of the city of Santiago, the Chilean capital.

Given its large indigenous population, Independencia is known as the \u201cIndigenous Cultural Center\u201d of Chile.
