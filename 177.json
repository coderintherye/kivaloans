Cocoyams are a root crop consumed locally. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":269159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of foodstuffs used in preparing cooked food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-09T18:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rosalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20250.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27047023,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938626,"comment":null},{"amount":35.4,"local_amount":17700,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":17921.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396261,"comment":null},{"amount":4.6,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904146,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126171,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549601,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983391,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895765,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735361,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T20:06:45Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88152,"name":"Yaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaa A. is 50 years old.

She uses metal for her manufacturing; it is cut into pieces and designed into sizes, after which she does the final design and welds the pots for sale. It is uncommon for women to do such work, but she says she loves doing it because it brings her satisfaction. Since demand for her products has become very high, she needs more funds to increase production.  She needs your assistance to buy materials like metal plates, rods etc. for manufacturing. With the loan she believes that she will have sufficient resources to make enough profit to provide her children with good educations.

Maritza uses large buckets as her principal work tools, and in the buckets she transports her cheeses and fish.  Through this work she ensures the necessary income for her home.

They are the parents of 5 children, 3 of the youngest who live with them in their own home. For 10 years she has worked selling used furniture from her home. Her work starts with a trip to \"La cachina\" in Lima where she selects and buys the furniture. Once back in her home city, her husband and children perform the work of sanding and lacquering leaving them shining and like-new. She can then sell them for a higher price, which is still within reach of her customers' pocketbooks. After all of this pre-work, she earns about 300-500 soles per piece although it takes a few days to sell one piece.  Mercedes is happy with her business especially since it involves her husband and children. The greatest demand for furniture is near the end of April when the coffee harvest comes in because then folks start buying furniture - it is the best time for earning capital and putting something away for a rainy day. Mercedes is eager to work especially since she has taken on the job of representative for her community bank and is committed to working for the group, and making payments on time. This is her first loan for which she is very grateful.

This has been a fruitful activity for her, especially during harvest time when her customer demand of 10 meals per day increases to 20 meals per day. She starts her work at 5am and works daily until 3pm, investing about 25 soles daily and earning almost double that amount, which allows her to cover the electricity and water bills as well as her children's educations.

Her house is located on the lands which she cultivates, about 7 kilometers from the city. Since she was very young she has worked cultivating ki\u00f3n (ginger), achote, and coffee. What she enjoys planting most is coffee, of which she has sown four hectares. Now, after 7 months, she is harvesting ki\u00f3n, which she has sold at 5 soles\/kilo. She and her husband enjoy this activity very much, as working on the farm is not difficult. What she enjoys most is planting coffee because she does not lose money - even when the market price is low during certain seasons, she just dries the coffee and saves it to sell later. The ki\u00f3n is different - she needs to sell it for whatever price is asked on the market at the moment. Segundina has future plans to buy land closer to the city so her children can study there and not have to walk hours to get to school. Despite the long distance she must travel, and that she has no responsibility within the group, she is the first to arrive at the community bank meetings. She is very happy with her group; this is her 3rd loan, and during this time she has shown she can make her payments responsibly.

He has worked from a very young age growing citrus and coffee plants, and for the last 10 years he has worked as a taxi driver using his father's three-wheeler van, generating an additional daily income of between 50 and 60 soles. He works from 4am to 10pm, Monday to Friday, reserving weekends exclusively for farm work. Yaner states that the crops must not be left to ruin, since the harvest seasons prove very profitable, having previously allowed his father to buy his three-wheeler. Since then Yaner has devoted himself to working with the vehicle, and though he occasionally experiences problems and has to carry out repairs or change spare parts, he is used to this routine. He wants to buy his own three-wheeler van to earn a full-time income and save up enough money to become a successful entrepreneur. Yaner is very enthusiastic about his local communal bank, having just been appointed President, and is very keen to work with all of the members for the good of the group. It is worth mentioning that he has successfully taught his fellow members to make repayments promptly.

Sokkhai C. is a villager in Ba Chay village in Kampong Cham province. She and her husband, Mr. Sam Oun, are farmers who own a plot of land to cultivate rice. In their plantation, they face some problems because their field is infertile and has a lot of insects.

Alid\u00e9 offers special 0% interest loans to very vulnerable clients and it is in a group which will soon be beginning a micro health insurance program.<P>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":269647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of drinks for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benoit","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":13000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":26000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":27836.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27047026,"comment":null},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938629,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396264,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904149,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126174,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549604,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983394,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895768,"comment":null},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":13000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13918.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T18:23:08Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88319,"name":"Suvonkul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B. Suvonkul is 56 years old. He is married and has 5 children. Mr. Suvonkul was born in a simple rural family and has worked with livestock for 30 years. He is very experienced and has special skills in livestock care that help him to develop his business. He raises and sells livestock and sells meat and milk. Suvonkul is requesting a loan of $800 USD to enable him purchase a second dairy cow. The second cow will enable him increase the milk produced and will provide income security to the family when one of the cows is in-calf. The income will enable Suvonkul provide for his family, take good care of his cows and supply his neighbors with quality milk. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a very hard-working and responsible entrepreneur. He and his family live in Isfara, Tajikistan. He is married and has a daughter. Mahmudjon works in the central city market selling kids' shoes and clothing for teenagers. His business is characterized by stability and consistent growth. He has been working in the market for 6 years.<p>\r\n\r\nOnce a month he travels to the neighboring city of Istaravshan to purchase new goods. Mahmudjon likes to work for himself. His business has been the main source of income for his whole family. Today Mahmudjon would like to ask for a loan of $1000 USD for the term of 10 months to purchase new clothing and shoes to sell. We believe Mahmudjon\u2019s drive for success will help this young entrepreneur succeed and thrive in business. You can be an important part of the growth of Mahmudjon\u2019s business.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Sayohat is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 39 years old, married and the loving mother of three children. Sayohat started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family expenses. For more than 5 years, she has operated a store where she sells kids' and women\u2019s clothing. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Sayohat hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. With this purpose Sayohat requests $1000 USD for the term of 10 months. She promises to repay the loan in time and thanks everyone supporting her.    <p>\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in traditional extended families in the Ganabougou district of Yanfolila prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  \r\n<p>\r\nThese women have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for two years and are on their third solidarity loan.  All the preceding ones have been correctly repaid.  With this new loan, they plan to buy two sacks of yams, four 25-kg sacks of dried onions, five sacks of salt, and some packets of Maggie bouillon cubes.  Supplies are generally gotten from merchants from the Republic of Cote d\u2019Ivoire each market day.  The goods purchased in this way are resold at the Yanfolila daily market at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed generally of women.\r\n<p>\r\nThis commerce can earn the women an average monthly profit margin of 40,000 francs CFA that enables them to make loan payments and to address certain household expenses (health, education, clothing\u2026 etc.).  Looking forward, each of these women want to expand their customer base, to have a nice house built, and to ensure the well-being of the children.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":269706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy condiments (dried onions, Maggi cubes, salt) and some yams  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kany                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamouni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haoua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":202449.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135825,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033624,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620992,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019957,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242702,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T11:11:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88351,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christiana is a 49-year-old businesswoman.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in traditional extended families in the Ganabougou district of Yanfolila (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  \r\n<p>\r\nThese women have been partners of Soro Yiriwaso for two years and are on their fourth solidarity loan after having correctly repaid the three preceding ones.  With this new loan, the women buy each week:  one sack of big millet (sorghum), some leavening, firewood, and other supplies for making the local beer.  The women help one another in this work, which demands a sizable quantity of firewood, water, and a lot of attention, so as to produce a quality beverage.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey each earn 10,000 francs CFA in selling the beverage each week.  The biggest sales are made on market days, during which villagers from surrounding areas abound.  This business enables the women of the group to realize an average monthly profit margin of 40,000 francs allowing them to make loan payments and to address certain household needs (health, education, clothing\u2026 etc.).  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":269718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for making the local beer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dewereni        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie Louise ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjaratou      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":202449.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135827,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033626,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620994,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019959,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101224.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242704,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-05T01:02:23Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88357,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy J. is currently in the business of selling meat, rice, and beans at a hotel.

With this they are able to repay the loan and meet some of the needs of their household (health, education, clothing, etc.).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":269725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy various food items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":253062.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135828,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033627,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620995,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019960,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":126531.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T04:32:02Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88360,"name":"Awa Yomb\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Awa Yomb\u00e9 D. est une femme mari\u00e9e, avec 02 enfants dont elle a la charge.

Most of their supplies come from wholesalers at the main market in S\u00e9gou, and they sell them either at the Ch\u00e2teau market (also in S\u00e9gou) or by walking around the neighborhoods of the village of S\u00e9gou-Coura to a clientele consisting mainly of women who pay cash or buy on credit. \r\nThe women hope to make a monthly profit of CFA 23,800 which they will save up and use to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":269731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy bowls, waxed cloth and soap ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia   Foun\u00e9          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aicha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135829,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033628,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620996,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019961,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242706,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":33741.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T19:42:04Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88363,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Veronica J. is currently in the business of selling charcoal.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Empieza a trabajar a las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana con la venta de pan hasta las 9, luego inicia las preparaciones del men\u00fa que ofrecer\u00e1 durante el medio d\u00eda. A pesar que el lugar donde cocina es muy inc\u00f3modo, Aidee contin\u00faa porque le gusta mucho su trabajo, termina de atender por la noche y si aun tiene clientes se queda hasta las 10 pm. Su anhelo es construir su casa en la  misma ubicaci\u00f3n de su kiosco, porque es un lugar estrat\u00e9gico para la venta, porque circula mucha gente, de ese modo, ya no se quedar\u00edan despiertos sus hijos hasta muy tarde y estar\u00eda m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda en el momento de cocinar.

","en":"Aidee is 36 years old and mother of three children, aged 10, 7 and 6. She owns her own home, where she lives with her partner of 12 years. Aidee works selling groceries and food in a kiosk near her house, and she always tries to keep it well stocked and to provide good service to her clients. She begins work at 6 in the morning, selling bread until 9, when she begins to prepare the menu she will offer at lunchtime. Although the space in which she cooks is very uncomfortable, Aidee continues because she really enjoys her work. She serves clients into the night, even staying until 10 pm if customers continue coming.\r\n\r\nShe would like to build her home in the same location as her kiosk, because it is a great location for sales, with many people passing by. This would mean her children wouldn't need to stay up late and she would be more comfortable while preparing food. Aidee is a very active member of her village bank, in the last cycle she was in charge of the fiscal department, ensuring there were no problems with members. This is her fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and in this time she has shown that she is able to pay her quotas very responsibly. The money she is requesting is to increase the merchandise available in her kiosk, in order to earn more money for her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":269801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Increasing amount of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T05:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2509.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T17:50:14Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88393,"name":"Abdulali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdulali Q. is 45 years old.

She has had six children, one of whom died. Now, three of her children still live at home. While the family has tried their hand at a variety of business over the years, they have always been farmers. A farmer's wife, Anselma has always shared in the agricultural work, planting coffee, cocoa and plantains. For the past 8 months, she has also sold fruit and vegetables at the market with her cousin, who has a stall there. Anselma has been happy with the income her plantain crops have been bringing in, but her experience with her cousin has made her realize how much more money she could make if she sold her crops herself, rather than selling them wholesale to the buyers that come directly to the farm. She has become very motivated to get her own market stall and in this way, increase her earnings.

Her business is very lucrative and brings in a good deal of revenue for her; she can sell more than two big boxes of potatoes per day. <P>\r\n\r\nIn order to expand and increase her working capital, she came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After 7 solidarity loans (group loans), all reimbursed without difficulty, she is on her first individual loan. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan she intends to buy 10 boxes of potatoes in Sikasso (third region of Mali) and in the villages surrounding Koutiala from producers. She sells opposite the hospital of Koutiala to a clientele made up of women and men, for cash and credit. <P>\r\n\r\nShe expects to generate a profit of 65,000 F CFA a month that she plans to use for reimbursing the interest on her loan and for participating in daily expenses for the family, investing the remainder in other activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":269829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of potatoes for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135831,"comment":null},{"amount":55.55,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033630,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620998,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019963,"comment":null},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242708,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678217,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112431,"comment":null},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028083,"comment":null},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":27777.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873467,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T22:27:19Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88409,"name":"Champ De Victoire Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles sells salted fish imported from Angola.

They have 2 children, who are both living at home. Nuria and her husband are farmers. They cultivate citrus fruit on their family's plots and they harvest the fruit between January and March. Because their farming does not bring in any money the rest of the year, Nuria's husband also works as a builder and she dedicates herself to a variety of activities. For example, she sells clothes with her sister every other weekend (see photo). Once, while she and her sister were selling clothes, they met people who farmed silk and who had been raising their own silkworms for a year. Listening to these people carefully, Nuria realized that the idea of becoming a silk farmer really appealed to her. She also thinks it will be quite profitable and would love to become a successful businesswoman in this trade. It would be wonderful to have another steady income, and not to have to wait so anxiously for the citrus harvest each year. Nuria also hopes to become a very active member of her communal bank and thus grow as a person. This is her first loan from MFP, and she is committed to making her repayments punctually. She will use the loan to buy fertilizer for the citrus trees, to plant beans and, if there is any money left, she will use it to start raising silkworms. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":269836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"for fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423756,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117041,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011954,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595540,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989801,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210936,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":101.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640442,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":101.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080113,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-13T23:12:07Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88412,"name":"Beni Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B\u00e9atrice W. is 49 years old and the mother of four children, of whom two are twins.

He and his wife have 2 children and they live together in a rented house. On weekends, he dedicates himself to his orchards, but during the week he rents a motorized rickshaw and runs a taxi service. He has been driving for 2 years now, and from Monday to Friday, Elvis works from 4am to 11 pm. He rents the rickshaw for 25 soles a day and earns 80 soles a day during the school year. During school vacations, he earns 40 soles a day. Currently, Elvis is having difficulty with his work, because his driver's license has expired and he worries about getting stopped by the traffic police before he manages to raise the money he needs to renew it. In the future, he would like to own his own rickshaw because then his driving would be quite profitable, and combined with the proceeds he earns from his fruit cultivation, his financial situation would rapidly improve. This is his first loan from MFP and he is committed to never falling behind on his payments, especially because he hopes to be a client of his communal bank for a long time to come. He will use this loan to pay the fees to renew his license so that he can keep working. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":269837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To renew his driver's license ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423757,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117042,"comment":null},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011955,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595541,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989802,"comment":null},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210937,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640443,"comment":null},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":66.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080114,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T03:42:22Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88414,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia tiene 40 a\u00f1os, tiene 5 hijos, D. los cuales dos D. ellos realizan estudios superiores en Lima, y con el resto viven en su casa D.

Not only does the scooter make it easier for them to transport their crops to the market in the city, but they have also received a license to use it for public transportation.

In the short time he has been driving he has realized he enjoys this kind of work, and has thought of buying a rickshaw of his own, as it would be mO. profitable. Adding to this the profits from the crops, he knows that he will be able to significantly improve his economic situation.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he has many positive expectations about working with a communal bank. The other members have named him secretary, and he accepted the post with a great deal of enthusiasm. He hopes not to disappoint his co-members or those who trust in his work. He is requesting the loan in order to pay the rent on the rickshaw for the next four months, to avoid it being rented to another person. The rest of the money will be used to buy fertilizers for his citrus plants. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":269844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Advance payment of rent for motorized rickshaw used for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T01:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johnny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423758,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117043,"comment":null},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011956,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595542,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989803,"comment":null},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210939,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640444,"comment":null},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":66.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080115,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T05:15:54Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88418,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel A. is married and has 4 dependents.

He lives in a rented room with his wife, and both of them want to move forward. Having spent his childhood on his native Amantani Island (Lake Titicaca), Alfonso knows that produce there is frequently in short supply. He has been in the business of selling farm produce for 10 years now and sails across Titicaca every week with his goods. He not only takes over the produce he has harvested, but also stocks the inhabitants of the island with everything they might need (supplies, furniture, groceries, etc.). His is a very profitable trade, as he is the only person doing this job. It makes Alfonso happy to know that the people of Amantani want for nothing thanks to his efforts, but transporting all of these goods is the hardest aspect of his work. He wants to give his wife a better life, she being the person who helps him the most in his labours, hence his unwaivering determination to achieve his goals. This first loan will help Alfonso to move forward. He wants to keep up with his payments so as to avoid creating difficulties for his local communal bank. He intends to use the requested money - indeed, the entire loan - to buy more merchandise to take to the island, as he feels that the residents of Amantani still need a good many things.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Stilgoe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":269959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T11:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":134.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117044,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":134.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011957,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":134.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595543,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":134.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989804,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":134.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210940,"comment":null},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":136.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T13:02:53Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88458,"name":"Ceferina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ceferina, es una madre abnegada, que desea con todas sus fuerzas ver profesional a su \u00fanico hijo, a sus 54 a\u00f1os a logrado tener su casa propia, pero aun quiere obtener muchas cosas m\u00e1s.

Ella trabaja sin descanso mes a mes con el \u00fanico fin de mejorar la vida que actualmente lleva su adorado hijo Cristian. MFP le a concedido por primera vez un pr\u00e9stamo a Ceferina, quien esta muy feliz por ello, ha trabajado mucho en su banco comunal para lograr este cr\u00e9dito y no quiere faltar a ninguna de sus cuotas. Con este pr\u00e9stamo, Ceferina comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s cosm\u00e9ticos, invertir\u00e1 todo el monto en incrementar su mercader\u00eda, para tener productos m\u00e1s surtidos.","en":"Ceferina is a selfless mother who wants, with all her might, to see her only son adopt a profession.  At 54, she's managed to get her own house but there are still a lot of things she wants.  For Ceferina, her son, Cristian, 11, has become the focus of all her efforts.  With her bag of cosmetics in hand, she goes out every day to convince her customers to buy a cream or some item of make-up from her.  Ceferina is very persuasive and it's not surprising that she's one of the top saleswomen.  She's operated the business for 3 years.  What she likes most is talking to customers and telling them about new products.  In the future, she would like to set up her own cosmetics shop becuase she's found it difficult to see all of her customers during every month.  Ceferina works tirelessly, month after month, with the single-minded goal of making a better life for her beloved son, Cristian.  This is Ceferina's first MFP loan and she's very happy to get it.  She's worked hard at her community bank to get this loan and doesn't want to miss a single installment.  She will use the loan to buy more cosmetics, investing the total amount in adding merchandise so that she has the stock she needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":269960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Add merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T21:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117045,"comment":null},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011958,"comment":null},{"amount":2.66,"local_amount":8.28,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595544,"comment":null},{"amount":72.55,"local_amount":225.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989805,"comment":null},{"amount":37.63,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210941,"comment":null},{"amount":36.95,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":119.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T00:55:20Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88459,"name":"Graciela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Graciela de 26 a\u00f1os, tiene una casa propia, donde vive con su esposo y su hija Leydi de tan solo 5 a\u00f1itos, quiere mejorar su futuro y el de su familia y para eso trabaja arduamente.

Battogtoh lives in a traditional Mongolian ger about 130 km from Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. She and her sons built the new store themselves. Both of her sons -- aged 12 and 16 -- go to school and help run the family business.  When Battogtoh goes to the market to buy goods, her eldest son works at the store and her youngest son goes with her to help carry the goods. The average daily income in the store is 30,000-50,000 MNT (about $20-40 USD), which mostly comes from selling milk, cigarettes, and bread. Most of the store's customers are Battogtoh's neighbors. This 400,000 MNT loan is the second loan she has taken from XacBank, Kiva's Mongolian microfinance partner. Battogtoh is a very open and active person.

Haika has been running a business selling phone accessories since 2005.<p>\r\n\r\nDespite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country (forgive the label, there remains no consensus on an acceptable definition), it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general. Not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids, street sellers. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people because there are few landlines, and followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Haika currently earns about $60 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $475 USD in order to increase stock of phone accessories.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":270235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase stock of phone accessories and business range","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T11:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":125399.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130731,"comment":null},{"amount":94.99,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":125399.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027519,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":125399.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613520,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":125399.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010599,"comment":null},{"amount":95.01,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":125400.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232885,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T20:53:41Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88496,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Erlinda A. sells a variety of goods in her neighborhood, which helps her sustain her family.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":270247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T11:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Butusyo A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":153999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130732,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":153999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027520,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":153999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613521,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":153999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010600,"comment":null},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153999.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232886,"comment":null},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":154000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T22:17:03Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88501,"name":"Perlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Perlita S. is a 51-year-old mother of 4 children and has a dress shop.

is married with six children and lives in Ntabesi, a quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon.  Vivian plans to invest her loan in her already existing provision. She will divide her loan between articles such as rice, savon, sugar, magi, palm oil and transportation costs.  She plans to contribute 50,000 CFA (approximately $100 USD) of her own savings towards her business plans.  \r\n \r\nThis is Vivian\u2019s second loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2007.  From her past experience, her articles are in high demand in her area and she can sell it quite quickly with fast turnover.  Bringing palm oil and other articles from the main market to her community will reduce the transportation costs of her clients as they will be able to purchase these items nearby.  She is confident that this loan will allow her to provide more products and therefore sell more as she will buy in bulk.  \r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Vivian hopes to expand her business.  She also plans to support her children, improve their education, and improve her family\u2019s living standards.  She knows she will not have a problem with her repayments because her loan schedule is set up so that her payments are small and regular.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

This is 25-year-old Vicki M. from Mbeya. She is single with 2 children, at the ages of 3 and 4. Vicki has been running a local restaurant known as \u2018Mamalishe\u2019 since 2002. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n \r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her mother. Vicki currently earns about $80 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $250 USD in order to purchase more rice, cooking oil, salt and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of goods for the business. Vicki thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":270255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice, cooking oil, salt and beans in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicki A.

Anna currently earns about US$44 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$600 in order to purchase more beans, rice and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the stock of goods. Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":270260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more beans, rice and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Anna A.

This is 45-year-old Lucia M. from Mwanza. She is married and has 2 children ages 15 and 19 years old. Lucia has been running a grain business since 1995. She sells grain, such as beans and maize, to different customers. She works in her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Lucia currently earns about $200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase more grains like beans, rice, and maize flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Lucia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

After having done many kinds of work unsuccessfully, she got started in this work buying and selling kola, which she had learnt with her parents at the age of 6.  She operates her business at the grand marketplace M\u00e9dine Sikasso.  Kola (a fruit from a tree in forested areas) is a product associated with all social events in Africa (sacrifices, gifts as a sign of respect and consideration, etc.)  \n\nConcerned about doing better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso six years ago.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area, she is on her fourth individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  She plans to use this loan to buy eight baskets of kola.  These goods are gotten from wholesalers of Sikasso and then sold retail to customers composed generally of the elderly and people organizing marriages and baptisms. \n\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":270292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy some Kola ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88526,"name":"Suleyman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suleyman A. is 40 years old and is married with four children.

(Hello!) from Tanzania! This is 39-year-old Victoria M. from Mwanza She is married and has three children between the ages of 13 and 21 years old. She is also responsible for supporting one dependent who is an orphan. Victoria has been running a shop since 2007. She works at the business for 9 hours per day, 6 days per week. Victoria currently earns about $300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, soaps and beans. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Victoria thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This is 47-yea-old Anna M. from Mbeya. She is widowed with 3 children between the ages of 13 and 24. Anna has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmamalishe\u201d since 1989. \r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a savory cooked banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 9 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Anna currently earns about $120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 USD to purchase foods like rice beans, potatoes,cooking oil and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase number and varieties of services in her restaurant . Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

(Hello!) from Tanzania! This is 39 year old Rukia G. from Mwanza. She is widowed with three children between the ages of 14 and 17 years old. Rukia has been running a business raising kuku. \r\n\r\n\"Kuku\" means chicken in Swahili, and raising them for sale is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients, for a number of reasons.They require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally. Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs that can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nRukia has had her business since 1999 and it is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Rukia currently earns about $150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase more chicken for the business. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rukia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is requesting a loan of $250 USD to buy children's clothing as well as women's clothing. In the future, she plans to add more clothes. Joyce thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA!\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":270332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy children's clothing, as well as women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":65680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130744,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":65680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027532,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":65680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613533,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":65680,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010612,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":65679.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232898,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T15:30:18Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88547,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose S. sells bread and is requesting a loan to expand her business and increase her profits.

This is 32-year-old Upendo M. from Mbeya. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 10 and 19.\r\n\r\nUpendo has been running a business selling clothes, plates, and maize since 1998. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband and her daughter. Upendo currently earns about $50 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to increase her capital by purchasing more crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the stock and the range of her business. Upendo  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

(\"Hello!\") from Tanzania! This is 40-year-old Jessie M. from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. She is single and has no children. However, she is responsible for supporting one dependent, because his parents cannot care for him. Jessie has been running a hair salon since 2008. Her salon is a place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair or blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. She works at her business for 5-8 hours per day, seven days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Jessie currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase ingredients for making food. In the future, she plans to open another business. Jessie thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

(\"Hello!\") from Tanzania! This is 28-year-old Joyce M. from Mwanza. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 4 and 15 years old. Joyce owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city where she sells common household and grocery items. She has had her shop since 2006. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Joyce currently earns about $160 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase kanga, cosmetics and soda. In the future, she plans to add more business. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":270363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

This is 35-year-old Juliana M. from Mwanza. She is separated from her husband, and has 3 children between the ages of 11 and 19 years old. Juliana has been running a grocery business since 2008. Her shop is a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof. She sells items such as beer, soda and water. She works in her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Juliana currently earns about $160 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase drinks like beer, soda and water. In the future, she plans to open another business. Juliana thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase drinks like beer,soda and water.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more grain for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T05:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130756,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027544,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613545,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010624,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232910,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664705,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105431,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022576,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867825,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757026,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T06:33:35Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88582,"name":"Hashim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hashim (his relative is pictured) was born in 1970.

Victoria thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Agnes M. from Mwanza. She is married with 3 children between the ages of four and nine years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because their parents do not take care of him. Agnes has been running a general store since 2008. She owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city where she sells common household and grocery items. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Agnes currently earns about 120 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy more items such as rice, soup, beans, cooking oil and flour. In the future, she plans to open another business. Agnes thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more items such as rice, soup, beans, cooking oil and flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T05:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130761,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027549,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613550,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010629,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232915,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664708,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105434,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022579,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867828,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757029,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T09:56:16Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88596,"name":"Roda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Roda P. sells bread and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

This profit will allow her to meet the health and education costs of her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy and re-sell pagnes (a type of West African clothing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135845,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033641,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621009,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019974,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242719,"comment":null},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":33867.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678235,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T01:40:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":88641,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dora es socia del Banco Comunal Obreras.\nDora es conviviente, tiene 46 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Dora viaja a las diferentes ferias de la regi\u00f3n en donde vende abarrotes y pollos para crianza, y de las ferias compra cereales, quesos que vende en los mercados de la ciudad de Ayacucho.\nDora necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de pollos bebes.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Dora con implementar cabinas de Internet en su casa y que sus hijos culminen sus estudios.\n\n","en":"Dora is a member of the Obreras Village Bank.
