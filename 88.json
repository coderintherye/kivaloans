Most of the commodities sold in Saleloga are purchased from the capital town, Apia, which is located across the island of Upolu.

She stopped studying due to her family\u2019s financial difficulties (they were 14 siblings and only some could attend school at the same time). In 1997 she met her husband, Paulo Miguel, who paid her tuition to attend 7th grade. Catarina got pregnant soon after, so she stopped studying again to take care of the house.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005 Catarina started working as an assistant at a company in Maputo, and with their monthly income  they were able to buy a house in the beautiful Matola neighborhood. In 2006, her father-in-law asked his son Paulo to take care of his driving school in Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, so they moved there.

They realized that Namaacha district has no funeral service, nor a place to buy coffins. They have already a land near the cemetery where they are building a shop to sell coffins and other funeral items needed for services. As Paulo was already a Hluvuku client (he had a loan to buy a new car for the driver\u2019s school \u2013 loan already concluded), Catarina decided to ask for this MTn 25,000 loan to buy the land where they will build the coffin manufacturing plant, just outside Namaacha village.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Catarina would like to go back to school.

She has been a widow since 1994 and has 2 children: a 18-year-old boy that goes to teacher\u2019s professional school and a 16-year-old girl that is still in 9th grade at the secondary school.\r\n<p>\r\nJosefa studied until 6th grade in Inhambane, but due to limited places for 7th grade, she moved to Namaacha in 1985 to live with her older brother that was a teacher. Josefa was studying at night and working at an agriculture company during the day. One year later, she got pregnant, so she stopped studying. She then worked for 3 years producing clothes at a local company, but had to leave because she got pregnant again. That was Josefa\u2019s hardest period; she was selling vegetables at the local market and barely making any money. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 1992 Josefa started cooking meals. She had a stand in the border (Namaacha borders Swaziland) and would cook meals daily. In 1999 the border was closed, and all the stands where taken and sent to a far away open market, that only opens twice a week (on Wednesdays and Saturdays). Since then life has been very difficult, as Josefa only works twice a week. Each meal as in the picture (chicken, tomato\u2019s salad and the traditional \u201cchima\u201d made of corn) is sold for MTn 40 (around US$1.6). Josefa makes around MTn 200 to MTn 300 in profits for a day. Since she sells food on credit, it is difficult to know the actual amount of money she may receive n a day.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Josefa\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku. She intends to use the MTn 6,000 to buy a large amount of raw material (tomatoes, corn, chicken, oil and so on) so that she can stop asking for credit at other stands. This will help her make more profit at  the end of the day. In the future, Josefa would like to build her own stand elsewhere, where she could work every day of the week and make even more money."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":147377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Buy raw material:

Paulo and his family decided to move to a smaller house for MTn500 and rented out their house for MTn800.This helps them pay all the medical expenses. The grocery stand business also suffered in these last few months, as just a little money was available to buy inventory. Knowing Hluvuku since they opened their branch office in Namaacha in early 2007, Paulo decided to ask for a loan of MTn 7,000 to buy inventory and keep the grocery stand opened.\r\n<p>\r\nPaulo is hopeful that he will get a job as a bakery driver and will soon increase his income.

His wife does not work, and thus, he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family\u2019s needs. I Nengah Sedra works on a 1-hectare farm owned by his parents. His family\u2019s daily expense is quite expensive especially since his children are still in school. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming equipment, seeds and supporting materials require a larger capital, which he didn\u2019t have. I Nengah Sedra is relieved that DINARI is helping him get a loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. I Nengah Sedra rents a tractor to till his farm because he doesn\u2019t have an ox to do the job. I Nengah Sedra is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes to yield better results from his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs, and if there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nI Nengah Sedra seorang petani yang sangat rajin dan ulet, semua dilakukan supaya ekonomi keluarga bisa tercukupi. Apalagi istrinya tidak mempunyai penghasilan tambahan sebagai pendukung keuangan keluarga. I Nengah Sedra hanya mengandalkan penghasilan dari pertanian untuk mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga. Sawah yang dikerjakan seluas 1 hektar dan itu pun masih menjadi milik orang tuanya. Biaya yang dikeluarkan setiap hari cukup besar apalagi anak-anaknya masih duduk dibangku sekolah. Sedangkan dari hasil panen yang diperoleh tidaklah maksimal karena dalam pengolahan tanah maupun pembibitan dan pemeliharaan tidak bisa dilakukan dengan maksimal,ini semua karena terbentur dengan modal. Tetapi sekarang I Nengah Sedra sudah merasa lega karena adanya pinjaman dari Yayasan Dinari untuk menunjang usahanya dibidang pertanian. Modal tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul,pupuk organik dan juga obat pestisida. Pengolahan tanah dilakukan dengan menyewa traktor, karena I Nengah Sedra tidak mempunyai sapi untuk membajak. Kini I Nengah Sedra sedang menunggu panen tiba, ia sangat berharap panen kali ini berhasil dan mendapat keuntungan yang meningkat dari panen sebelumnya. Keuntungan ini nantinya akan dipergunakan untuk menunjang pendidikan anak-anaknya dan apabila ada sisa I Nengah Sedra ingin sekali bisa memperbaiki rumahnya yang belum selesai dibangun."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":148689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy
