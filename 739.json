She lives with her domestic partner with whom she has two older and independent children.  She and her partner live together in a house they were able to buy through hard work and sacrifice.  \r\n\r\nMartha sells prepared foods.  She rises very early to go to the market and look for the freshest ingredients and best supplies to be able to provide a good product to her clients.  Once at home, she prepares food and then goes out to sell to her customers, who are very loyal.  They know her food has good flavor, and Martha has a unique relationship with them.  \r\n\r\nAll of this work is done from the home, and Martha is happy to have overcome the fears and doubts she had before she began working. She likes what she does because it allows her to use her time effectively and earn additional income through sales of other products like soda and ice. She is doing well and has future plans to establish a restaurant in her home, but she knows it is a lengthy process.  For now, she just wants to continue to improve and increase little by little the variety of dishes offered to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Martha's second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very happy to receive financial support through which she can increase working capital.

She learned this trade from her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital to buy wool, which she acquires in bulk at the fairs.  Upon making her products, Elena sells them from her home.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family.  She is married and has four children.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Elena said that she enjoys the health services.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375.01,"image":{"id":944841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool.

It was complicated at first because there was difficulty having access to electricity and running a refrigerator was costly.  But all of the obstacles have been overcome and now things are going fine with plans for growth.  This is her third loan through MFP and she is happy to count on this financial support which will give her confidence to advance in her business.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time and continue being a member who pays punctually.  She enjoys her communal bank because all the members are very supportive and responsible.  She plans to use the 2,000 PEN loan to buy more beverages and have a variety of products to offer customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":352.53,"image":{"id":944864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more beverages, including beer and sodas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T11:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":305.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":303.55},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":330.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":343.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":349.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":367.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.59,"local_amount":305.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:23Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836339,"comment":null},{"amount":113.83,"local_amount":303.55,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":307.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246106,"comment":null},{"amount":124.11,"local_amount":330.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":335.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386126,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T19:35:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370358,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is 40 years old and is married with 4 children.\r\n\r\nFatima owns & operates a business venture, selling both food & daily-use products in the local community.

is Jocelyn, 54, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother of two children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJocelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJocelyn dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Single, she manages her household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nVirginia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Virginia is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to increase her business in the coming years.

He spent several years working in Russia, and earning that money was not easy.  He returned home and got involved in animal husbandry right away.  Shavkat used his earnings to purchase eight heads of sheep and two heads of cattle and was able to increase livestock headcount over the years like this.  Currently, he has forty heads of sheep and six heads of cattle.  Today, he needs to expand the barn for his livestock because it will not fit there in the winter.  If Shavkat does not build a barn for the livestock, then he would have to sell some of the sheep, which would not be economical, since he is buying sheep at low prices now.  Shavkat is requesting a loan in the sum of 7000 Somoni to purchase construction materials to build a barn, and to use the rest of the money to purchase sheep and fodder for it.

is Melinda, 48, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Rogelio, a mechanic, and is mother to their children. She has managed to support her children's schooling. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMelinda oversees operations of their jeepney  transportation business (see footnote). They have one jeepney with a 14- to 16-person capacity. Melinda and her husband also manage their motor repair shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment for their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMelinda dreams to be able to buy another jeepney. She also dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":311.46,"image":{"id":945262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for accessories and spare parts for their jeepney and equipment for their repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4179.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738878,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4178.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146104,"comment":null},{"amount":119.79,"local_amount":5209,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275270,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T16:19:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370506,"name":"Tsovinar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsovinar lives with her son.

His wife is a housewife who works in the garden and raises pigs. \r\n\r\nI Nyoman is making a serious effort to raise pigs because the results are very helpful for the family economy. One of the results is to help finance his daughter's college education. Currently he has 10 sows and a 56 square meter cage. At this time he sells piglets and fattening pigs for rolling pigs. \r\n\r\nHaving more than five pigs of course generates a lot of manure. Up till now to manage the pigs' manure, he used it for organic fertilizer. However, due to an increasing number of pigs, I Nyoman felt overwhelmed because of the air pollution they generated. In addition to pollution, they created an unhealthy environment as well. \r\n\r\nHearing of the biogas program from MUK, I Nyoman immediately joined. He wanted to turn pig manure that had been considered pollution into something useful. During this time he used two LPG gas cylinders every month. Each gas cylinder weighs 15 kg and costs 82,000 Rupiah (IDR). With the biogas, he hoped to be able to save on expenses to cover the kitchen.

Olivia works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nOlivia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nOlivia hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She works as a senior nurse at a hospital and has been working there for five years.  Her oldest son works at a construction site and repairs buildings.  Her other son is in Russia and sends her money monthly.  This is Marifat's first loan with our organization.  She wants to use this loan to purchase a crib and gifts for her grandson.  According to our tradition, she, as the grandmother, has to purchase many toys and clothing.  They will hold a circumcision ceremony for her grandson and hold a wedding.

She also buys and sells peanuts, which she purchases at 8 PEN and sells for 10 or 11 PEN.  The business is easy.

Esta feliz familia vive en una casa propia en el centro poblado de Kivinaki, en la provincia de Chanchamayo. Kivinaki es un lugar propicio para el desarrollo de frutos como: naranjas y tangello, productos a los que dedica mucho de su tiempo para su producci\u00f3n. Del mismo modo, pero en menor cantidad cultiva paltas y pl\u00e1tanos.\nCon esta actividad pudo educar a sus hijos, quienes tambi\u00e9n la apoyan en las labores del campo.\nLos cuidados para sus sembr\u00edos son constantes, por eso debe recurrir a personal para que trabajen sus tierras.  \nPor su parte Miguel, su esposo, trabaja como alba\u00f1il en distintas construcciones. As\u00ed a\u00f1aden m\u00e1s ingresos a su canasta familiar.

She married husband Miguel 19 years ago, and together they have two children, ages 18 and 15. This happy family lives in their own home in the center of Kivinaki, province of Chanchamayo, Peru. Kivinaki is a place for growing fruit, such as oranges and tangelos, produce to which Vilma dedicates a lot of her time. She also grows avocados and bananas on a smaller scale. With this job she was able to educate her children, who also help her in the field. Care for her crops is constant, so she has to rely on workers to tend to her land. Her husband is a construction worker, so they both add to the family finances. And since Vilma is a nonconformist, she also spends time working as a kindergarten teacher in the community of Yaroni. \"I like to feel busy,\" she says proudly. \"What I do makes me feels good. I can provide my family what it needs to live in a decent way.\" In the future she would like to set up rooms in her home because she sees a lucrative business in renting out rooms. This will be her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she welcomes the support in advance. She feels content to belong to the \"Las Semillitas de Kivinaki\" community bank because she knows working together will produce better results. With the loan, she plans to hire workers for her orange and banana crops. If the work is intense she plans to allocate between 250 and 300 soles (approximately $90-$110) for 10 workers a day."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.43,"image":{"id":945780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire 10 workers to grow oranges and bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-15T05:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":63.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":74.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":90.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":93.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":98.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":104.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":109.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.41,"local_amount":126.42,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":127.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246111,"comment":null},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":66.72,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":67.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386131,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T09:33:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370781,"name":"Divino Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El contacto para el inicio del presente comit\u00e9 fue la se\u00f1ora Sara, qui\u00e9n  invito y organizo a sus amigas para formar parte del programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras.

He considers his work a great source of income because he knows he must work the greatest number of hours possible to earn a good income.\r\n\r\nHe drives a mototaxi for eight hours a day, serving approximately 40 customers. This allows him to earn an average of 70 soles a day; around 90 if it's a good day. In the city of Ica, the cost of transport in this vehicle amounts to an average of 1 or 1.5 soles per trip, depending on the distance he has to travel.\r\n\r\nArturo thinks that his business is successful because of the determination he puts into his work. With the help of the Kiva lenders, Arturo's effort will be worth a lot more. This is because he wants to do maintenance work on his mototaxi, so as not to have problems on any of the trips he makes. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to have another business, and to build his own house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":116.16,"image":{"id":945788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To do maintenance work on his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tingui\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":152.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":157.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":164.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":181.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.26,"local_amount":152.68,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":154.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142512,"comment":null},{"amount":58.9,"local_amount":157.08,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":158.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271100,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T15:50:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370785,"name":"Jorge Fructuoso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio es el Sr. Jorge Fructuoso;  Continua con su negocio con su taller de carpinter\u00eda metalica, el socio continua con sus diferentes trabjaos de carpinteria metalica como puertas, portones, escaleras, ventanas, rejas entre otros mas, el socio a estado ampliando su negocio y a\u00fan le falta inversi\u00f3n para comletar la ampliaci\u00f3n, motivo por el cual en esta ocasi\u00f3n el socio desea el credito para invertir en la compra de materiales y en la ampliaci\u00f3n de sus local.\n","en":"The member is one Jorge Fructuoso.

His biggest priority in life is to be close to his family and to offer them a better quality of life.  He started his urban transport business 3 years ago and it is his source of income.  However, there is one thing preventing him from earning more, and that is the fact that he rents the vehicle he drives from another individual, which creates additional expenses for L\u00e1zaro.  He therefore wants to purchase a truck that has been offered to him for a good price and is in perfect condition.  L\u00e1zaro wants to take advantage of the offer, but he doesn\u2019t have the capital that he needs to complete the deal.  That is why L\u00e1zaro is asking for your support: so that he can raise the money he needs to purchase the truck and thus earn more income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.04,"image":{"id":945957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a truck to use for his transport business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T03:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lazaro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8396.05,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":680.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":789.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":850.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":916},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":986.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1144.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1232.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.07,"local_amount":430.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":444.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392333,"comment":null},{"amount":131.97,"local_amount":1772.79,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1830.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704741,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T00:12:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
