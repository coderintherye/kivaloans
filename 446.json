Its members are jointly liable for loans granted by Kiva through the MFI HOPE DRC to grow their businesses.\n\nJean Claude started his business in 1987 with a capital of $15 selling pairs of slippers. After he went bankrupt from 2004 to 2006 because of theft, he decided to open a general boutique that he operates today. With hard work and determination, his business prospered. Jean Claude is happy to be part of one of Hope\u2019s groups.  He has already received six times the loans and his business has been reinforced through the loan he received. Jean Claude intends with the next loan to diversify his business by adding a cassava leaves pounder and other items to reinforce the inventory of his business in order to increase the profit. He is 48 years old, married and has four children between the ages of 1 and 27 of whom one goes to school. Currently, Jean Claude makes the profit of about $90 per week. His dream is someday to expand his business in different markets in Kinshasa.

first and foremost to his family, Kahramon works very hard at his ranching business. He has his own herd of cattle with which he works day after day to earn a living to support his dear wife and two children. \r\n\r\nJust as every business requires investment, Kahramon's business now needs to add some young bulls, which will be raised and sold. For this reason, he once again has turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to acquire the cattle and, in this way, serve to help improve the standard of living of his beloved family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It is made up of 12 women from the same neighborhood, who are neighbors and\/or have the same interests.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anta Bouya S., who is on the extreme right of the photo and dressed in a large orange \"boubou\" (African dress) sprinkled with white stars, is in charge of the group. She is 57 years old, married and mother to six children. She also has responsibility for her daughter-in-law and granddaughter.\r\n\r\nShe has a small business selling necklaces and jewelry made out of colored beads. She makes the necklaces herself before retailing them on a door-to-door basis. She has been carrying out this business for at least 20 years.\r\n\r\nHer new loan will allow her to buy a large quantity of colored beads in order to make up more necklaces and other jewelry and make a more significant profit. Her aim is to boost her savings and provide for her family's needs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4625,"image":{"id":585478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase colored beads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Louga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta Bouya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maguette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndathe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Ale","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieyla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Koursoum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Astou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2350000,"loan_amount":4625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":4625,"local_amount":2350000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2361353.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195813964,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T19:43:21Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223577,"name":"Celina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celina S. is currently in the business of selling local brew and beer in the bar and is requesting a loan to stock more crates of beer to sell.

She is married and has three children between the ages of 10 and 32. She runs a business out of her home preparing and selling fast food, such as hot dogs, sandwiches, kebabs and french fries, that she makes with the most delicious seasonings and sauces. She started a business 10 years ago with a shop in another neighborhood in Soledad. She used her first loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to strengthen her business and further prospered with three more loans, but during her fourth loan she lost her son to an illness and she closed the business and moved to her home. Five years later, she started her business selling french fries and later when a neighbor showed her the techniques to prepare other fast foods she started her current business in place of the old one. Selling the different kinds of fast foods, her business gradually grew and Dora took advantage of her sales points very well. First, she rented a hot dog cart for 60,000 pesos a month, and later on she purchased a cart for 1.2 million Colombian pesos. She gradually kept adding other equipment to expand her infrastructure, first a heater, then chairs and finally a microwave oven. Currently she wants to expand the range of products she offers and add others like ice cream, pastries and beverages, and that is why she is turning to Kiva. She plans to make her first order of ice cream and purchase the sauces, seasonings and flour necessary to make her products. Her goal is to keep her business prospering by diversifying her products and adding other familiar staples so she can emulate the success of the shop she once had.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She used to work from her home and her husband distributed the products to the major shopping centers in Barranquilla.  They also sold retail outside; that is Yadira would manufacture the goods and her husband would sell them.  This experience lead to what she does exclusively today, making beautiful and colorful purses, wallets, and very modern synthetic accessories.  Yadira is very dedicated to her work and in touch with the current fashion, so that she can create or copy the designs that her customers like best and are most profitable.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan through \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\u201d  The first loan allowed her to increase her production and subsequently created a need for working capital that she had not counted on.

Currently, she and her husband work together, carefully tending fields where they grow potatoes, peas, and gladiolas. \r\n\r\nAna really enjoys her work because it provides regular income that helps her family enjoy an adequate standard of living.

She is also very satisfied with the hard work of the members of her communal bank.

Their house is located in a peaceful village in the central mountains of Peru.  Celestino has been farming since he was a young man.  He currently grows potatoes, peas, corn, and gladiola flowers in his fields.  What he enjoys most about farming is seeing everyone in his family help one another because they are all aware that the work requires sacrifice.  Celestino monitors all of his crops because he does not want to be negatively impacted by plagues of insects or adverse weather conditions.  He believes his dedication is rewarded at harvest time, when everything he produces is sold at the wholesale market in the city at regular prices.  In addition to farming, Celestino also raises animals such as cows, bulls, sheep, and pigs.  He sells the animals whenever he attends the city fairs.  Being an entrepreneur, he wants to plant in greater quantities in the future and also buy more animals to sell later so that he can obtain a generous income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third time he has received a loan from MFP.  Celestino is grateful to everyone who made this loan possible because it will allow him to continue working.  In addition, he says he is pleased with the work of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible individuals.  Celestino plans to invest the loan he requested in the purchase of seeds for planting peas and several sacks of compost and fertilizers that are needed to improve crop production.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":585602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase compost, fertilizers, and seeds for planting peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463107,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T13:51:05Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223648,"name":"Wilson Hipolito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilson de 38 a\u00f1os, el es vendedor de refrescos y frutas como coco y sandias, vive en las Orqu\u00eddeas de Guayaquil (en una zona urbana, con una ecolog\u00eda en construcci\u00f3n). \n\nTuvo su negocio porque en el sector por donde vive no hab\u00eda un puesto de frutas,  comenz\u00f3 a vender cocos, poco a poco con esfuerzo pudo vender sandias y otras frutas, ahora se levanta a las 04h00am hasta las 15h00 todos los d\u00edas.

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Several days ago, he requested his CrediKiva because he needs to buy merchandise like small appliances and a wider range of cell phone calling plans. He would also like to add many other kinds of merchandise to complement his call center, but he realizes that he must wait a little while until the loan he is currently investing comes back to him. His clients are already requesting cell phone accessories, new phones, briefcases, sweets and drinks, since his call center has advanced. \n\nFor slightly over a year, Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo has been supporting Esmereney so that he can expand his business through loans. Esmereney has been able to expand the range of products he offers and gain a wider base of customers from his neighborhood and other nearby communities.

He is also an upstanding member of the community in which he lives; there is no doubt as to his continued growth, since he is very hard-working and people prefer him. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She thanks you for your support. Whether on the streets of Kathmandu, or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal. Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.\r\n\r\nWith a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked, while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Baptist Model Secondary School was established by the Baptist mission primarily to educate the children of Allen town and its environs. The school is staffed with fifty teachers and has 2,100 pupils.\r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT to seek a loan of SLL 7,400,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house building materials, buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in a business. \r\n\r\nJohn A. B. is the leader of this group of teachers. He is age thirty-eight. Abu is married and has two children. Mr. B. will use part of his share of the loan to pay school fees for his children and will use the remainder of the loan to pay school fees for himself to pursue further studies. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":584856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":" pay school fees for his children and  for himself ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John A.

peruana. Desde muy joven ayudaba a sus padres en largas faenas agr\u00edcolas, y as\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 todo lo necesario para cultivar, es por eso que en la actualidad siembra papa y arveja junto a su hermano, en las chacras de su madre. Le gusta la labor agr\u00edcola, pues dice que le gusta vigilar las tierras con dedicaci\u00f3n, brind\u00e1ndoles los insumos necesarios para que produzcan en cantidad. Cuando es tiempo de cosecha, si no se abastece en el trabajo con su hermano, contratan operarios, y de esta manera venden toda su producci\u00f3n a los mayoristas de la ciudad, quienes le pagan regulares precios, sobretodo por la arveja, que es una legumbre bastante cotizada en el mercado nacional. Como es un joven emprendedor para mas adelante tiene planeado sembrar en mayor cantidad, para mejorar sus ganancias, y as\u00ed espera convertirse en el mejor productor de la zona. Es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y esta muy agradecido con todas las personas que hicieron posible el cr\u00e9dito que les permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso, adem\u00e1s esta muy satisfecho con el buen desempe\u00f1o de su grupo comunal, pues esta integrado por personas bastante responsables.

He lives with his 56 year old mother, Agripina, and his older brother, 29 year old Orlando.  They live together in his mother\u2019s house in the central Peruvian mountain range.\r\n\r\nSince he was very young he helped his parents with the long agricultural chores.  That way he learned everything he needed to in order to farm.  That is why he now plants potatoes and peas with his brother.  They plant on their mother\u2019s fields.  He likes farm work, and he says that he likes watching over the fields.  He does it with dedication, and he gives the plants what they need to produce in quantity. \r\n\r\nIf he and his brother need help at harvest time, they hire workers.  They sell all of their production to wholesalers in the city.  They pay him the usual price, especially for peas.  Peas are very sought-after in the national market.  In the future, as a young entrepreneur, he plans to plant in greater quantity to improve his income.  That way he hopes to become the best producer in the area.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.  He is very grateful to all of the people who made the loan possible.  They will allow him to continue working in the pursuit of progress.  Also, he is very happy with the good performance of his communal bank.  It is comprised of very responsible people.\r\n\r\nEduardo plans to use the loan to buy several sacks of fertilizer and pea seeds that he needs for the next season.  He wants to increase his production, and he hopes that this way he will continue to make progress.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":585630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy pea seeds and sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463109,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-19T16:43:17Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223679,"name":"Alejandro Usberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro tiene 60 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y vive junto a su esposa en el distrito de Tambogrande, un distrito agr\u00edcola caracterizado por producir principalmente frutas, las cuales son procesadas para luego exportarse a diversos pa\u00edses del exterior.

Con los primeros rayos del sol, cada d\u00eda esta trabajadora mujer se despierta para empezar la faena agr\u00edcola, junto a su esposo, pues siembran juntos papa, arvejas, ma\u00edz y diferentes verduras. Pese a que esta labor debe ser constante, as\u00ed evitaran que las plagas de insectos y los factores clim\u00e1ticos echen a perder toda su producci\u00f3n, ya que depende de ello para obtener regulares ganancias. Dice que recibe ingresos adicionales cuando ella misma traslada sus productos, sin intermediarios, sin embargo no le gusta cargar los pesados sacos hasta la movilidad y de ah\u00ed a los mercados. Como es una mujer muy emprendedora para el futuro tiene planeado sembrar en mayor cantidad, pues quiere convertirse en una de las mejores productoras de su zona.

She lives with her 40 year old husband, Mois\u00e9s, and their four young children.  They work hard every day to get ahead.  At the first light of day this hard-working mother gets up to start the agricultural chores with her husband.  Together they plant potatoes, corn, and different vegetables.\r\n\r\nBecause they work continually, they avoid insect infestation and the weather factors that cause the loss of all of their production.  She depends upon the crops in order to get a steady income.  She says that she gets additional income when she transports her products without intermediaries.  However, she does not like to carry the heavy sacks to the vehicle and from there to the markets.\r\n\r\nAs a very enterprising woman she plans to plant in greater quantity in the future.  She wants to become one of the best producers in her area.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She pledges to make her payments on time.  Also, she is very grateful to all of the people who make the loan possible.  It allows her to keep working in the pursuit of progress.  Flor plans to use the requested loan to buy various sacks of natural and chemical fertilizers.  She needs them to assure her production for the next planting season.

She has been dedicated to agriculture from a very young age. She learned cultivating techniques by helping her parents, then she formed her own family and began working with her husband. She says working in the fields is very demanding since she grows potatoes and peas in her own small farm and must keep an eye on the crops daily, from very early in the morning to protect it from pests and insects and the harshness of the weather that many times affect and attack their crops ruining the majority of the production. What she does not like is carrying, along with her husband, the large sacs of natural products to take them to sell all the way to the markets in the the city in spite of assuring that she earns regular profits by selling wholesale. Since she is an aspiring woman she plans to increase her pea production in the future. In addition she wants to buy and raise cows and then eventually sell them at the highest price possible. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she promises to be punctual and responsible in her loan payments. She is also very thankful for all of the people who made this loan possible that will allow her to continue progressing.

T. is 50 and married with seven children (ages 10 - 32).  She owns a business venture selling food products in the local community.  Faauliuli has three years of experience in this business.  Faauliuli needs a loan of WST $1,750 to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faauliuli joined SPBD.  This is her third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faauliuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

D. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 32 years-old and married with two school-aged children. To make a living, Rosemarie owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Rosemarie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosemarie joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosemarie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosemarie is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Rosemarie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

K. is 43 and married with six children (ages 9 - 19).  She owns a business venture planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Asovale has five years of experience in this business.  Asovale needs a loan of WST $2,900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Asovale joined SPBD. This is her fifth loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asovale's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.

A. is from the village of Lantungan, Aurora Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 44 years old, married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Yolanda owns and operates a restaurant serving a variety of different meals to customers in the local community. Yolanda is just starting this business and already earned 4,500 PHP.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Yolanda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.\r\n\r\nYolanda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Yolanda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

S. is 48 and married with eight children (ages 4 - 10).  She owns a business venture selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Fualaau has one year of experience in this business.  Fualaau needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fualaau joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fualaau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or about $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Uiese joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD.

After graduating from college, Jiparkul worked as an accountant at the local hospital. Her colleagues characterize her as a very diligent and responsible person.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, salaries in rural areas are very low and Jiparkul decided to produce and sell lepeshka (flat loaves of bread). But it was not a very profitable activity and additional earnings were required in order to support her family.\r\n\r\n A few years ago, using starting capital of only 1,000 KGS, Jiparkul decided to start her business in cattle-breeding and bought sheep.  She concentrated all her efforts on supporting and expanding her household. For this very reason, Jiparkul wants to take out a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy three bull-calves and 20 sheep for fattening and reselling. With the revenue from this investment, Jiparkul plans to give higher education to her children.

None of them could get an education due to financial constraints. Both of her sons work. The older one sells shawls and the younger one sells clothes by going door to door in communities. \r\n\r\nHer husband runs a clothiing shop in the market. He buys the clothes from cities Multan and Lahore. These days her husband is facing the problem of low inventory and is unable to fulfill the requirements of the customers. Therefore, she has applied for a loan for the 3rd time from Asasah to financially help her husband. \r\n\r\nWith the loan he will buy clothes in bulk for selling. This will not only cut the cost of traveling but also he will be able to buy the clothes on discount as a result of bulk purchasing. Shamim is hopeful that this investment will bring happiness to her family and that her family\u2019s standard of living will improve.

Pascoli, has found himself in this enviable position for the last twenty-five years In Kyaliwajjala, Mukono.\r\n\r\nPascoli\u2019s shoemaking and sales business has, in a way, propelled him to some considerable financial glory, notwithstanding the fact that he, in most cases, faces problems of shortage of shoemaking materials. This has often been his biggest undoing.

Asuncion is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Asuncion from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":585984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ricoro, Gingoog City, Misamis Oriental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asuncion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1978.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172125307,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1695.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177419102,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":847.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182558181,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1130.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188694404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T20:39:13Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":223854,"name":"Mabira Womens Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"50-year-old N.

A. N. is twenty eight years old, married and has one child, aged five years old. Her business is located at Mtopanga tushikane estate in Mombasa,Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many many tourist attraction sites, including the Indian ocean's white sand beaches. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling fruits and vegetables for the past six months to the local people. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is weather conditions, in relation to where her business is located. During rainy seasons it becomes too hard for customers to access her business and during the dry seasons it becomes too dusty. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well and also providing good customer service to grow her business.

She is positive that her businesses will grow since she already has regular customers buying her pigs after four months and solid clients for her E-loading business at home.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a pig farm someday and to provide satisfactory E-loading to her customers. She hopes to have successful businesses that can provide her with a good life and enable her to move beyond the poverty line. She is grateful to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\nCarmelita\u2019s long term goals are to build sustainable businesses and to fund her three children\u2019s college education.

owns a stall in Kalerwe market, selling bananas. She buys bunches of bananas from villages in Masaka District and uses public transport to and from making these purchases. She would like to use this loan of 1,000,000 to buy more bunches of bananas. In addition to her banana vending business, Hajara also owns motorcycles for hire and offers rental rooms. \r\n\r\nHajara sells her wares to all categories of people, both in retail and wholesale. She works six days a week and makes her purchases once a week. Her business challenges include problematic transportation and dealing with the rainy season, which often makes village roads impassable.

is married with five children, four of whom go to school. She doesn\u2019t take care of additional family members. Kasifa owns a retail shop in Natete selling all types of merchandise like sugar, salt, soap, cooking oil, dry cells and exercise books. She buys her merchandise from Kikuubo in Kampala city and uses public transport to and from shopping, which she does once a week. She has been in this business for four years. She wants to use this loan to buy more bags of sugar, boxes of soap, cartons of salt, and cooking oil. Besides this retail shop business she sells secondhand women's clothes and piped water to earn additional income. She works seven days a week.

is a vegetable and fruit vendor. She owns a stall at Nakawa market in the city suburbs where she sells her wares. She buys her fruits and vegetables from the very market where she works and therefore does not incur any transport costs during purchasing. She has been in this business for ten years. In addition to her market stall, she owns a small retail shop at her home which brings in some additional income.\r\n\r\nShe sells her wares at retail prices and works seven days a week. Her business challenges are seasonality and defaulters. She aspires toward a business model where she would eventually sell her wares directly to farmers. She also hopes someday to build her own house. \r\n\r\nShe decided to join MCDT because they were giving out timely loans at low interest. She would like to use this loan of 800,000 to buy more baskets of mangoes, oranges, pineapples, cabbages, and yellow bananas.  \r\n\r\nEdith resides in a rented two-roomed house with her husband and six children. All their children attend school. She also takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses include food, rent, and school fees.

In 2007, he started his own cleaning business and has been running it with his wife.\r\n\r\nWith ACCION USA\u2019s help, Juan was able to receive his first loan in 2009 to purchase cleaning equipment. Now, Juan is refinancing his loan in order to bring his business to a new level. He is looking to purchase equipment, sign new client contracts, and launch a multimedia marketing campaign and website.\r\n\r\nJuan is optimistic that these strategies will help him gain more clients. He is looking to expand his business beyond his local community. The loan will also help him sign larger contracts, which will generate higher revenues for Juan\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nBeing self-employed and generating income for his family have been Juan\u2019s greatest successes. He has great pride in providing for his wife and two young daughters. Juan enjoys managing his own business and loves the flexibility of his work. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":578396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase

They all live together on a trail along the pleasant Peruvian hill country. \r\n\r\nShe has been working in agriculture since she was young. First she helped her parents, now she works the land with her husband. They plant potatoes, peas and corn on their own farm. She enjoys waking up early to tend to her fields because she knows her hard work is necessary to obtain a productive crop to sell to the whole sellers in town. She sells her production as soon as she harvests it because her buyers know the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nShe always works thinking of improving her children's lives. She wants them to go to school and become professionals. In addition, she says the hardest part of her job is transporting her production to sell it since the bags are very heavy. \r\n\r\nBeing the entrepreneur that she is, she plans to plant more to generate more income. This is her seventh credit with MFP. She is very thankful for all people who have made the loan that will help her continue to work possible.

Together they live in a modest house in a quiet zone of the central sierra of Peru. She works in agriculture because she says it is what she knows how to do best. She learned how to do it by observing her relatives and neighbors in the community. Currently she works together with her husband growing potatoes, peas and corn. Although the farming work is self-sacrificing because you have to get up early every day to care for the crops in order to ensure a good production, she says that during the harvest she gets her reward. Since the better you care for your crops the better the products they will produce. Because her natural products are good quality, she has regular customers in the largest market in the city and from the sales she gets regular profits, which allows her to give her family an appropriate quality of life. For the future she plans to plant larger plots of land. She also wants to buy some heads of cattle to raise and have for whatever difficulty that may arise. This is her third loan with MFP and she is very thankful to all the people who made the loan possible as it will allow her to continue working in search of progress. Also, she says that she is satisfied with the performance of her communal group because all the members are very responsible with making their payments.

The rest live by themselves and work in the city. When she was very young she learned the farming techniques necessary for a productive harvest. It is for this reason that she currently plants peas, potatoes, corn and other vegetables. She says that she likes this work a lot because she works with her son and together they keep watch of the crops every day starting at sun rise. She says that the reward of her constant labor is to watch during harvest time since she gets good quality fresh products which she sells at regular prices to the wholesalers who come from the city. The part she doesn't like is the many times is when they don't treat her crops adequately and the crops are infected with plagues of insects. She sadly remembers one time when she lost almost all of her products for this reason. As she is a very enterprising woman who always thinks about the future, she already has a plan to plant in larger quantities to increase her earnings.

Even though she is now stocked with more products and merchandise, what would help her business stay in operation is a freezer, shelving, and other supplies.  Margelia is a saleswoman who offers Avon products and also takes on sewing jobs by accepting orders.  Martha sells meats and vegetables from her home and as a street vendor.  Finally, Carolina sells both new and used clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nMost of these women have children who are teenagers, so their dream is to provide them everything they need to become successful professionals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in her parents' house, together with her 2 brothers. She is a law student, and during the mornings she devotes herself fully to studying. However, 9 months ago, she began selling and distributing sports clothing to private schools in her area. She pursues this new activity during her free hours and on weekends, without neglecting her studies. She undertook this work thanks to her mother; it was difficult at first, but as time passed, she was able to establish herself and manage the business. Now she feels happy, since it is profitable for her, and it will help her cover part of her expenses at the university.
