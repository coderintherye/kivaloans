Because of this, it opens business opportunities, especially in food vending.\n\nMs. L. grabbed the opportunity and has applied for a loan of Php 17,000 payable in weekly installments, so that she can meet the demand of her increasing number of customers waiting for her delicious food. She is planning to buy more meat, vegetables, ingredients, soft drinks and cooking utensils to expand her business.\n\nMs. L. wanted to learn and cook new menus, too, for her customers to love. With help from ASHI and Kiva she is praying her plans will materialize. The accomplishment of her dreams is to expand her business, earn more, and send her children to college to pursue a career.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":588240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To

She is also a very good mother and carries out her responsibilities as a housewife well. Her elder daughter is fourteen years old and the second one is just one year younger. Both stay at home and help their mother in taking care of domestic chores. Her husband, M. A., works in a factory on a monthly wage. \r\n\r\nParveen displays her hand-made embroidered clothes in her boutique. She uses a room of her house for her boutique business. She has been doing this work for over fifteen years. She has a good clientele. She imports clothes from different cities such as Faisalabad and Lahore, famous for their textiles and new designs, and then makes them more beautiful by crafting new embroidered designs on them. She earns approximately 5,000 PKRs every month but it is double that amount on occasion. \r\n\r\nParveen has applied for a loan from Asasah for her boutique business. With the loan amount she will buy clothes, beads, tassels and sketches in large quantity and make more dresses to display in her boutique. She is hopeful that this investment will help her to make more dresses because the Eid (Muslim festival which comes after Ramadan) is near and people will come to her to buy beautiful clothes.  \r\n\r\nParveen is in her 4th loan and has shown herself to be a responsible loan user in Asasah. In the previous years of loan experience she has maintained a good credit record and never missed any meeting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":588281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase

A. and resides in a city called Multan, famous in Pakistan for its sweetmeats and shrines. She owns a small house of two rooms there and has been living in it with her family for over fifteen years.  \r\n\r\nShamim has given birth to six children: four daughters and two sons. All of her children are enrolled in a local school and read in different grades: 9th, 4th and 2nd respectively. She is bringing them up with care and discipline and wants to provide them with a quality education so they make their future bright. To achieve this purpose she works hard at running a boutique business in her house. \r\n\r\nShe uses a room of her house for her boutique where she displays embroidered and non-embroidered dresses and attracts customers. People who approach her mostly are her neighbors. She imports cloth from Faisalabad and Lahore, famous for their textiles, and then sews them well and makes embroidery on them to give them a new look to attract more customers. She earns approximately 10,000 PKRs from her business. Her income becomes double on special occasions. Eid, the Muslim holiday which comes after Ramadan, is near and she can improve her sales on this occasion. That\u2019s why she has applied for a loan from Asasah for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWith the loan amount she will buy cloth, colored thread and beads in large quantity which will help her to make more dresses to display in her boutique. She is in her 2nd loan and has shown herself to be a very responsible loan user of Asasah.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":588301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase

Grace is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Grace from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units of offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":585826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Plaridel Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15774.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850959,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T17:56:10Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225090,"name":"Tuong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuong T.

She got her education up to 5th standard but couldn\u2019t get further education due to poor financial conditions in her family. She mostly spent time with her mother and learnt the skill of embroidery from her.\r\n\r\nHer mother worked at a boutique business. Salma got the experience of running a boutique from her and now, by the grace of God, she has started doing the same business after her marriage. Now she makes dresses to display in her boutique and attract customers.  \r\n\r\nHer son is just one year old; his name is Ghulam Jailani. She wants a good future for him, and that\u2019s why she works hard to fulfill that dream. Her husband is a tailor by trade. He runs a tailoring shop in the nearby market where he sews specifically men's clothes and earns income.  \r\n\r\nSalma has applied for a loan from Asasah for her boutique business. With the loan amount she will buy cloth, colored thread, and sketches in large quantity and make more dresses to display in her boutique.  She is on her 2nd loan. In her first year of loan experience she has paid her installments on time and never missed any

Juana is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Juana from GDMPC.

She is grateful to Juhudi for teaching her business skills that have enabled her to plan her life well and even  educate her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":587472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To open a cereal business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":6670,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6761.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142459,"comment":null},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":6670,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6761.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437312,"comment":null},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":6670,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6761.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576674,"comment":null},{"amount":181.75,"local_amount":14540,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":14739.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450226,"comment":null},{"amount":151.44,"local_amount":12116.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12283.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030198,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668264,"comment":null},{"amount":98.71,"local_amount":7896.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8005.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446803,"comment":null},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":6670,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6761.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535744,"comment":null},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":6670,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6761.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221857453,"comment":null},{"amount":67.86,"local_amount":5430,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5504.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227073751,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-23T19:53:46Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:41:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225106,"name":"Teressa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teressa C. is from the city of Gango, Ozamiz City.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

More particularly, there was the revolution that happened on the 7th of April and interethnic conflict in the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic. These events changed the situation in the Kyrgyz Republic in all of its aspects: social, economic, political, etc. While the government is working towards stabilizing the situation, ordinary people are trying to return to their normal way of life. So are Shairkul D., the leader of this group, and all the members of her group.\r\n\r\nShairkul is married and has four children. She works as a cook in the hospital and earns 1,400 soms monthly. She and her husband are representative of traditional Kyrgyz families: they live together with her husband\u2019s parents and breed cattle. They are almost fifteen years into their cattle breeding business. They started their business with an initial investment of 15,000 soms and it now brings 11,500 soms monthly. Now, they have bought a car for her husband and he is working as a taxi driver with an income of 10,000 soms.\r\n\r\nShairkul and her husband realize the crucial role of education and want to give to their elder daughter an opportunity to study at an institution of higher education. Thus, they are asking for a loan of which the most part will go for the payment of the tuition fee for their daughter\u2019s education and the another part will go to the purchase of hay for their cattle in order to continue their cattle breeding business.\r\n\r\nThe other group members:\r\n\r\nKului S. is the treasurer of the group. She is 49 and married with two sons: her elder son lives independently; her second son is 16 and is going to graduate from school this year. Kului works as a cook in the hospital and receives 1,800 soms monthly. Her husband is mainly involved in their family cattle-breeding business but also makes some money as a builder. They started their family cattle breeding business nine years ago with an initial investment of 5,000 soms. Now, they have significantly increased their livestock population and their business brings them 7,800 soms monthly. Together they have built a house for their elder son and he lives there with his wife. Now, their daughter is planning to get married. With the loan, Kului is planning to buy a dowry for her daughter.\r\n\r\nAzamat S. is 27 years old and is single. He works as a masseur in the hospital and receives 2,000 soms monthly. He bought an area of 0.7 hectares (1.75 acres) under crops. He started his business seven years ago with an initial investment of 10,000 soms and it now brings 5,100 soms monthly. Azamat wants to have a beloved wife and many children. Still, before getting married, he wants to build a house where he will live his happy married life with his family. He is asking for a loan which will help him to buy construction materials to build a house and his future.\r\n\r\nNurzat A. is 40 and married. She is a nurse at the central hospital and receives 3,200 soms monthly. She has two daughters: her elder daughter is 16 and is going to graduate this year and her youngest daughter is 13 and goes to school. Nurzat\u2019s husband is a farmer and their family business gives them 11,000 soms monthly. As with other mothers, she wants to give the best to her daughters. Thus, she is applying for a loan in order to pay the tuition fee of the institution of higher education so that her daughter has an opportunity to study and become a qualified specialist in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Riawind is located in the Punjab province of Pakistan and is famous for its dairy products and agriculture. Zubaida is 37 and has 6 children. Unfortunately none of them could get an education due to the family's poor financial condition.  \r\n\r\nZubaida got married to M. B. who is attached to the profession of selling milk. He has four buffalos at his home which produce milk for him. Zubaida helps her husband in getting the milk from the buffalos by getting up at 5 o\u2019clock in morning every day. Then they both put the milk in milk-jars and her husband goes to different milk shops to sell it.  Zubaida takes care of the cattle by providing them food and water as well.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her increase their family income to PHP 22,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is requesting PHP 15,000 which she will use to purchase a new engine for their fishing boat so that her husband could continue with his fishing activities and Rosalie will have fish to sell. They are both working very hard to send all their children to school. Rosalie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to buy additional groceries to sell in her sari sari store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for emergencies.

She has one child who is 25 years old. \r\n\r\nVilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 63,000 PHP, bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for her general store and gear and parts for her fishing boat. She hopes that she could save enough from her earnings for the future education of her grandson and improve the quality of life of her family.

Bayarbat is 47 years old and lives with his wife, mother and 2 sons, Bilguun (20) and Ariunjargal (22), in his mother's apartment in Ulaanbaatar City. The two sons are both students in the university. Since 2002, Mr. Bayarbat has been running a taxi business consistently. He is a very hard-working man. His goal is to give a proper high education for his kids. \r\n\r\nHis wife, Narantsetseg, rents a stall in Bumbugur, the second largest indoor market, and has been doing it since 2008.

She started with little capital but with inspiration from her mother-in-law and gets many customers who buy her products for food consumption such as hotel owners. \r\n\r\nShe is able to make 100,000 Ugandan shillings monthly. This is a fair earning by Ugandan standards, and as such she requires a loan that will help her buy more food supplies for the business. Then she will be able to meet the customers' demand and also get more revenue. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to a group of members and they insure each other in paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":588385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"more stock into the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliasaph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hope","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1800000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":450012,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297273,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":450012,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467547,"comment":null},{"amount":200.89,"local_amount":452000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":452012.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605638,"comment":null},{"amount":199.11,"local_amount":448000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":448011.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483442,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-24T01:18:36Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225219,"name":"Lona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Lona K. is currently in the business of selling exercise books, pens, sharpeners, pencils, etc in a book shop and is requesting a loan to stock boxes of chalks, file holders and textbooks to sell.

Clovis is a 42-year-old married father of 8 boisterous schoolchildren. To shoulder his responsibility for providing for them, he has over the course of the last 10 years been operating a home products retail shop in Butiti Trading centre, Mubende District, alongside a butcher shop. His business has not been without setbacks since its beginning; he has had to bear with myriad challenges, such as the lack of steady income inflow. However, his business has remained active. This  he attributes principally to the good understanding he has struck with his clientele. \r\n\r\nBefore his current businesses, Clovis was a hawker in Kampala, moving with his goods from place to place. In a month, Clovis says he makes more than 320,000 Ugandan shillings, a figure he admits will not substantively make his business grow in the near future. He is therefore seeking a loan to lend countenance to his business so that he is able to do restocking for his shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":524259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"buying more stock for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyenjojo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clovis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gordelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adolf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edivin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reginah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5100000,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1275000},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1275000},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1275000},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1275000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":568.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":568.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":568.75,"local_amount":1275000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1279721.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297274,"comment":null},{"amount":395.89,"local_amount":887500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":890786.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467548,"comment":null},{"amount":521.8,"local_amount":1169750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1174081.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605639,"comment":null},{"amount":538.17,"local_amount":1206451,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1210918.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744721,"comment":null},{"amount":250.39,"local_amount":561299,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":563377.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352737,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-26T16:47:11Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:02:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225224,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Mary M. is currently in the business of selling mixed goods such as: beer, soda, sugar and beans in a retail shop and is requesting a loan to stock more crates of beer and sodas to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

James tells us that he was encouraged by his parents to save money, which is how he was able to buy his own land. Now that he owns his own farmland, he is able to quit his previous business of selling waragi, a local brew.\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, James looks forward to improving his banana plantation through mulching and other farm inputs, the lack of which is reducing his returns currently. This will give his ventures improved returns for some time to come. This loan will be used for the purchase of pesticides and mulches as well as other materials that will allow him to achieve better yields. His motive is to earn more money so that he can pay his children\u2019s school fees and to expand his businesses for more income.\r\n\r\nJames is the father of three children with only one attending school at the moment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":587514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pesticides and mulches as well as other materials that will allow his farm to achieve better yields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297275,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467549,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605640,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744722,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482897,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909637,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352160,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206218723,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211293844,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":151879.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216573842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-24T01:43:23Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:47:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225231,"name":"Shirali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K. Shirali is a hardworking man who works in the cattle raising business. He is married with four children. He works hard to provide everything his family needs.

His goal is to then get the most return from the sale of the cows' milk products. This will be his first loan with IMON and Kiva. His evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abdumumin is 52 years old. He is married with four children of school age. \r\n<p>\r\nAbdumumin is a manufacturer. He produces wooden doors and window frames. His shop is located in his house. By working in the business for eight years, Abdumumin has become a rather experienced master.

There is also a trading place located in the local market. \r\n<p>\r\nIn general the business is very successful and generates a stable income for his family. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, Abdumumin is planning to employ an additional woodworker so he can expand his business. For this reason, he requests 4,500 Somoni.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kiva borrower is a 45-year-old married man and father of five children, two of whom are employed. A resident of Lebanon, he has over 25 years of experience working with spare car parts and car repair. He is the main provider of his family, although his two working children try to help him with a small amount of support. He is requesting $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to increase his inventory and therefore increase his sales. In the future, he plans to open a bigger store to trade and sell spare parts. He told us that he would like to one day open a big center. <p>\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).  Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Lebanon's borrowers.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in microfinance.<p>\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.<p>\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

C., aged 36, and her husband have six children \u2013 four of them are at school, one is working, and one is currently living at home. Elsa works hard to cover her daily expenses by direct selling fiber drinks, coffee and chocolate drinks to generate a small profit each month.\r\n<br>Elsa has applied for a loan of 12,000 PHP to help restock her supplies. She hopes that the purchase of additional health drinks will allow her to expand her business and generate more revenue. Elsa has been a member of Kiva partner, the Center for Community Transformation (CCT), for several loan cycles and has consistently attended weekly fellowship meetings*.

She hopes that the loan will help her continue to run a stable business.  \r\n\r\nNerry is a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT), where she has received and repaid several loans, and has consistently attended weekly fellowship meetings.* She hopes that she will continue to be able to pay for her children's education while covering her costs.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are members of fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is made up of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":588542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to buy new items to sell to her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.62,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2700.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821753,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.69,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6751.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088997,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5401.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380363,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.37,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5401.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816704,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-24T01:52:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225271,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary D. makes a living selling rice, cooking oil and vegetables at a local market.

Today, he is requesting a loan of $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase needed supplies for his agricultural work. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profits by 15%. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (for example, blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture and not indicating his name and location). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

C. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fish-vending business. Her husband Mariano C., who is 57 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have five children who range from 16 to 29 years old. \r\n\r\nCirila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cirila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 16,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future and for an additional business. \r\n\r\nCirila C. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nThis picture was taken after the center meeting because the fish was delivered early in the morning to her buyers in the market. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon  Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With her first loan from KIVA she was able to improve her business and recommended herself as a trust-worthy client of AqroInvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":588564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase two cattle and four sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2010-08-24T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arzu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":900,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":192.3,"local_amount":153.84,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":154.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172066569,"comment":null},{"amount":88.95,"local_amount":71.16,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-25T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":71.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182802597,"comment":null},{"amount":94.07,"local_amount":75.26,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":75.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189113545,"comment":null},{"amount":93.43,"local_amount":74.74,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T22:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191532618,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-19T08:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196334080,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201229653,"comment":null},{"amount":42.54,"local_amount":34.03,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206372433,"comment":null},{"amount":144.96,"local_amount":115.97,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093024,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":75.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216449688,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":150.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613813,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-24T02:32:48Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:15:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225285,"name":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Lugazi is a cosmopolitan metropolis and her customers range from the poor to middle-class people and traders from other towns who come to do business. The basis of her success, she says, lies in hard work, a \"never give up\" attitude and courage in tackling challenges.

He is still quite young, but he has proven to be a successful entrepreneur with his computer and games shop. He has owned and run this shop for more than three years. With his loan request of $800 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will improve his business and purchase new computers at good prices and he needs this amount to add to his saving to buy them. Those computers will allow him to significantly increase his productivity and also his income. He is positive about his business prospects and plans to further expand. He is hoping to open a new branch of his shop in the coming year. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages them to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen: Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

is an active member and treasurer of Thoth Ber Group, which is being funded by Juhudi Kilimo. He has been practising mixed farming for 25 years and has employed one farmhand. His main products are maize, beans, nappier and bananas, which he sells at the local market. He also earns income from his rental houses in the same area.\r\n<p>\r\nDavid has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 45,000 Kenyan Shillings to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says with this loan he will be able to provide his family with enough milk for consumption, get enough manure for the crops - especially nappier - and sell milk, which will increase his income. His main challenge is the lack of organised markets and the unpredictable weather patterns. He hopes that his business will have improved in five years time and he will have acquired other dairy cows.\r\n<p>\r\nDavid is 52 years old.

Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fish-vending business. Her husband Emiliano S., who is 52 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have seven children who range from 6 to 31 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and send her children to college. Erlinda S. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

has a mixed farm in the town of Nkubu in Eastern Kenya. He has been farming for the last nine years and has employed one farm hand. His farm produces bananas, milk and coffee which he sells at a local market. He also earns income from his wood workshop in the same area.\r\n\r\nHis biggest challenges in farming have been the unfavourable weather conditions and fluctuating milk prices.\r\n\r\nJamlick recently completed his previous loan of 40,000 Kenyan Shillings from Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan of 60,000 Kenyan Shillings to upgrade his banana farming. The excess income from this loan will help him in educating his children. He says that this loan will also improve his production on the farm and therefore provide him with a stable income.\r\n\r\nHe is hopeful that in five years time his farm will have expanded since he plans to plant more bananas and even construct a zero grazing shed for the dairy cows. He comments that Juhudi loans have helped to build him as a farmer. He is now able to do commercialized farming whereas before he used to do subsistence farming.

Taba-ao, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish.  Her husband Deonesio V., who is 54 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  They have 7 children who are 17 to  34 years old. Carmencita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmencita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use purchase more fishing nets and repair her existing nets so that she could continue to save up for future and also repair and improve their fishing boat. Carmencita V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband works as a driver of a minibus.  Mrs. Karla has a small bookstore business and also sells cosmetics and other general merchandise.  She started this business two years ago by selling school supplies to children when the school term started, taking advantage of the fact that her house is a half a block from the school.  She is well situated for the children to buy at her bookstore.  Her mother passed this business on to her, in the beginning her mother was the one going to Managua to do the purchasing.

T. is 48 and married with 3 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 320 talas or US $133 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Taape joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Taape's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

G. is 41 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Karoline has 4 years of experience in this business.  Karoline needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 210 talas or US $88 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Karoline joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Karoline's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 42 and married with two children.  She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Faatamalii has one year of experience in this business.  Faatamalii needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faatamalii joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faatamalii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 27 and married with three children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting 'taamu' (giant taro root) for sale.  Temukisa has three years of experience in this business.  Temukisa needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Temukisa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Temukisa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

old, a single woman, and lives with her only son in the Tejedores Bajo village in the agricultural district of Tambogrande, an area producing export fruit, within the Piura province. It is located in the the Piura region, more than three hours from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region. \r\n\r\nShe is a teacher by profession and with much effort managed to save money during the years she has been working in order to get a used vehicle which she uses for her cargo and passenger transportation service. Her service covers the route from Tambogrande to Cruceta. The vehicle is driven by her youngest child and with the income that they receive from this business, both are able to support their daily lives. \r\n\r\nLayne would like to buy a new set of tires so that her vehicle can work better. Due to its constant use, its current tires are in bad condition. In order to do this, she is applying for a loan of 1200 soles for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa. \r\n\r\nLayne is a hardworking mother who very much likes the work that she does. She is quite well known in the area that she lives in and is respected by her neighbors and friends.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":588795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy new tires for the maintenance of the vehicle she uses for cargo and passenger transportation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-24T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Layne Marita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":88.32},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":99.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.73},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.02,"local_amount":82.72,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":86.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832991,"comment":null},{"amount":32.06,"local_amount":85.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":89.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099597,"comment":null},{"amount":386.92,"local_amount":1031.8,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1083,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-24T05:58:12Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225459,"name":"Malia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 40-year-old married mother of eight, Malia T. has owned a business catching and selling ocean fish for four years.

With two years of experience in this business,  Lalovi is now requesting a new loan, her second, of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lalovi joined SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Lalovi's only access to capital because she has never been able able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's lending philosophy is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.<p>  \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

K. is 36 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Puna has three years of experience in this business.  Puna needs a loan of WST 1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to further improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Puna joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Puna's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

V. is 34 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Palepa has many years of experience in this business.  Palepa needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Palepa joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Palepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 30 and married with five children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Litia has many years of experience in this business.  Litia needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Litia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Litia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 72 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lotoi has 3 years of experience in this business.  Lotoi needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lotoi joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lotoi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

K. is 37 and married with five children.  She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Daisy has 3 years of experience in this business.  Daisy needs a loan of WST 2500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Daisy joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Daisy's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

H. is 36 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Kalameli has 3 years of experience in this business.  Kalameli needs a loan of WST 2000 to buy raw ingredients to make cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nKalameli joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Kalameli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

I. is 62 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Elisapeta has 3 years of experience in this business.  Elisapeta needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elisapeta joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Elisapeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Akenese has 3 years of experience in this business.  Akenese needs a loan of WST 2900 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and cordial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Akenese joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Akenese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 39 and married with six children (ages 3 - 19).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Paulia has 2 years of experience in this business.  Paulia needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Paulia joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Paulia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

M. is 29 and married with three children (ages 1 - 14).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Menime has 4 years of experience in this business.  Menime needs a loan of WST 2200 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Menime joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.

With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 90,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business.

She also added school supplies to her business inventory so that her customers would no longer have to trek up to a bookstore to buy their needs. Her variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Angela earns her profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Angela\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan.

She collects orders from different boutiques and clothes shops and earns an income by fulfilling them. She charges approximately 1500 PKR for each embroidered dress and she completes five dresses per month, which enables her to generate 7500 PKR per month.

One of her dreams is to construct an inn and thus, offer better service to people who come to visit the municipality. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":589133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"BUYING FLOUR (CORN AND WHEAT), BEANS, MEAT, VEGETABLES, LARD, OIL, CONDIMENTS, SALSAS, EGGS, BREAD, COFFEE, SOFT DRINKS, AND JUICES","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-08-24T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172173218,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177469243,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607268,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189188994,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191484380,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195911176,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201353620,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206220182,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295359,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1842.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216575297,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.
