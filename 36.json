of Ngh\u1ec7 An. In 2003 she contracted a loan of 200 USD. She used this money to buy a calf. After 4 months, she sold the calf for 250 USD. The profit from selling the calf was a big motivation factor for her to continue. She contracted another loan after that to start businesses of pig raising  and liquor making. The liquor making business brings in 2.5 USD daily. With this revenue, Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t repaid the loan and the daily expenses. The waste from her liquor making is used to feed her pigs, this helps cut the cost of pig food. Running both businesses in parallel is quite convenient, it helps reduce considerably the time it takes raising the pigs. Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t is requesting a loan of 325 USD. With this loan she would buy 8 breeding pigs and a peep of egg laying chickens. Selling the eggs would bring in enough revenue to pay her weekly expenses. For the pigs she hopes to sell them in the new year, this would bring in 500 USD. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ea1t s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 5 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con t\u1ea1i Nghi L\u1ed9c, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Kasdu expects that his earnings will increase with a new and more reliable motorcycle.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nBapak Kasdu mempunyai usaha menjual makanan ringan dengan cara keliling naik sepeda motor. Adapun jenis makanan yang dijual seperti: makanan ringan untuk anak-anak, krupuk dan sebagainya. Dengan modal perhari Rp.350.000, Kasdu membeli bahan dagangannya tersebut di suplier dan mulai keliling dari jam 09.00 sampai jam 19.00 dan keuntungan yang diperolehnya sebesar Rp.60.000.-, dengan hasil tersebutlah Kasdu menghidupi istri dan 1 orang anaknya dan sebagian disisihkan untuk membayar sewa tanah Rp.25.000 perbulan sedangkan rumahnya dibangun sendiri dan sangat sederhana dengan bangunannya \u201cgedeg\u201d dan lantainya tanah. Pinjaman dari dinari digunakan untuk membeli sepeda motor yang lebih baik dan menjual motornya yang lama karena motornya yang lama sudah tua sehingga jalannya agak lambat, dengan harapan penghasilan akan meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":62074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She still lives here with her husband and 4 kids. For the past few years, she has had to take become the mainstay of the family's economic survival, as her husband hasn't had a steady job for quite some time! Occasionally he works as a hired hand in agricultural duties (the area has a lot of cocoa farming, and there's a need for laborers at the time of hand-picking of this precious fruit! He now works assisting her in her clothing sales, by delivering the goods and doing some collections himself! \r\n\r\nThe clothing Antonia sells comes from \u201cpacas\u201d (or packs of pressed new and used clothing which Dominicans can buy from donations to the poor on the Haitian side of the island, which the people bring over to the Dominican Republic in order to sell them and thus, be able buy food and groceries). \u201cPacas\u201d come in at least three types: Type A, B and C. Type A packs are mostly of \u201cpremium\u201d goods, as they contain new items, often from signature brands, and which command a \u2018premium\u2019 price, for obvious reasons. On type A\u2019s (worth between USD$300 to $400) there is more income to be made, as they can be sold to a higher income bracket customer. However, Antonia tells us thus far she has only been able to buy type B \u201cpacas\u201d (worth some USD$250 to $300 mainly dependent upon the composition and proportion of the new\/used portions of clothing to be found on them) which is obviously of a lower quality from those on the type A group. Finally the type C \u201cpacas\u201d (costing anywhere from USD$100 to $250, each) are the cheapest, obviously consisting of used clothing or new of lower quality. \u201cPaca\u201d buyers must trust their intermediaries, as the insides are not able to be seen until the packs are opened. Normally the \u201cpacas\u201d are opened and sold on a piece by piece fashion, which will bring the largest return on the sales. However, those go to the Haiti-Dominican Rep. border in order to buy the \u201cpacas\u201d, as Antonia does, can buy them at lower prices than those that might be found in or near the cities, such as Santo Domingo. The trip to the border costs somewhere in the neighborhood of USD$25-30 each way, expensive, but there\u2019s no other way\u2026 Of course, both the sacrifice as well as the cost is recuperated a few times over, once the \u201cpaca\u201d buyer has been able to do the purchasing and transportation to the end market\u2019s territory. The unopened \u201cpacas\u201d can command up to three times the value over their original cost once brought into the final market areas, as the owner\/buyer is able to maintain the quality standards customary to their customers. But most prefer to have the larger income product, which may be brought in selling them piecemeal! \r\n\r\nAntonia wishes to be able to have her kids grow, become good citizens and show their love for the country! This she plans making via sufficient income in order to be able to pay for their transportation, and daily needs with school. She\u2019s never had a type A \u201cpack\u201d, as she\u2019s only been able to pay for a maximum of the \u201cB\u2019s\u201d value. Eventually, she\u2019ll be able to buy the As type, as she\u2019ll receive more good and larger loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":62733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Antonia will now be able to buy more \"pacas\" which she expects to need on a weekly basis, as opposed to her now bi-weekly capability.

Cecilia Armida H. Rodriguez is a 54-year old language instructor.  She used to work as a public school teacher but had to give up her job when she found a tumor on her throat, for which she had an operation.  To keep herself afloat, she began to sell food from her house in the Victor Larco district in the department of La Libertad (in northern Peru).  She sold little of her \"caldo de gallina\" (chicken stock\/broth) before she was invited by a neighbor to join the \"Las Palmeras\" group.  With her first loan of S\/.300 (300 Peruvian nuevo soles or around US$96), she bought food in bulk--rice, oil, potatoes, etc.--to get the best prices and was able, as a consequence, to vary her menu.\r\n<p>\r\nNow she sells caldos in the morning and \"criolla comida\" (common Peruvian meals) in the evening.  She also takes special orders during the week and on weekends for parties.  With the S\/.800 (around US$255) loan, she will continue buying wholesale food products: rice, oil, sugar, potatoes, \"menestras\" (a vegetable soup).\r\n<p>\r\nSrta. Cecilia is the secretary of her community bank and, in light of her career as a teacher, was chosen as the president of the management committee of the Atencion Integral del Nino de Pobreza y en Riesgo (Joint Attention to Poor & At-Risk Children) for the Victor Larco district.  She is responsible for 12 Wawa Wasi daycare centers--a government program for low-income children--with a total of 96 children ranging in age from 6 months to 4 years.  She dreams of improving her house for her nieces and nephews, some of whom she's raising, and saving for a time when she might not be able to work.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1orita Cecilia Armida H.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

is a group loan to be shared by the twenty women of the Foulacounda Association, led by Ms Egue S..  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The Casamance is a very remote region of Senegal.  It has the potential to be rich, but is nevertheless very poor.  Its population is young and the majority are women, who dominate the local economy and constitute the engine of development.  In this area, the majority of young girls and women do not have any source of income, and this is the cause of the exponential growth in migration away from rural areas.\r\n\r\nThe women of Casamance are brave and hardworking, especially in trade.  However, they lack the chance to put these attributes to good use, because they are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation.  In fact, in many cases the wife is the most important member of the household, thanks to her role in producing food for the family and countless other responsibilities...\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenues for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can engage in trade of products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, tea, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.  This will allow the women to make a profit and repay the loan.\u201d \r\n\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : La Casamance est une r\u00e9gion tr\u00e8s enclav\u00e9e du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The Casamance is a very remote region of Senegal.  It has the potential to be rich, but is nevertheless very poor.  Its population is young and the majority are women, who dominate the local economy and constitute the engine of development.  In this area, the majority of young girls and women do not have any source of income, and this is the cause of the exponential growth in migration away from rural areas.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women of Casamance are brave and hardworking, especially in trade.  However they lack the chance to put these attributes to good use, because they are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation.  In fact, in many cases the wife is the most important member of the household, thanks to her role in producing food for the family and countless other responsibilities...<p>\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenues for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.<p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can engage in trade of products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, tea, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

association, led by Ms. Marie Gabrielle G..  In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cWomen occupy an ever greater place in Senegalese society.  They regulate home life, are responsible for children's education, and moreover are called on ever more frequently to contribute to the economic resources of the household.  This is why the women of our group wish to work together to find opportunities to develop revenue-generating activities.  For a start, the group wishes to request a loan of 400,000 francs ($850), a sum which will be shared among the members of our group.  Since our association is composed of subgroups with different business activities, the loan will be divided equally between the seamstress groups and the traveling sales groups.  The loan will be repaid in monthly installments, to be deposited on the tenth of each month.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French business description:<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abLa femmes occupe de plus en plus une place importante dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9n\u00e9galaise elle jouent un r\u00f4le de r\u00e9gulatrice au sein du m\u00e9nage elle est la responsable de l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants mais est appel\u00e9 de plus en plus a participer \u00e0 la vie \u00e9conomique du m\u00e9nage .d\u2019ou le d\u00e9sir des membres    femmes  pour la solidarit\u00e9 et le d\u00e9veloppement de chercher des activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenues.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":64278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase cloth for a seamstress business and household products for aretail business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Thiaroye Sur Mer","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.7425 -17.379444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-09-11T08:45:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Gabrielle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-25T15:12:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80016,"comment":null},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93762,"comment":null},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T05:03:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106903,"comment":null},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715,"comment":null},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2008-03-25T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":165290,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191066,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-05-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218723,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-06-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247855,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276396,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305979,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2008-09-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-26T07:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":337026,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-11T15:12:09Z","paid_date":"2008-09-26T07:27:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":17927,"name":"Malohat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B.

is thirty-nine years old, and is married with two boys who are in classes three and two. His wife stays at home but is currently training to be a hair dresser. She wants to open a salon so that she can supplement on her husband\u2019s income, and and most important ly, to stay busy. John says, \"An idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop.\"\r\n<p>As a side business to his work as a builder, John sells firewood to some business people in Malaba. He sells it to milk sellers who use it to pasteurize their milk; fish mongers who deep-fry the fish in their canteens; and sometimes to caf\u00e9 owners who use firewood, which is the cheapest source of fuel.\r\nJohn gets his stock of firewood from different places within the district. He usually gets the waste from loggers, gathers the scraps of wood until they fillsa truck, and transports the wood to Malaba. John has been able to provide one the cheapest source of cooking energy to the community and also helps minimize waste from trees cut down for lumber.\r\n<p>Currently, Johns does not own a store, but uses his compound as the site for displaying his product. The price he charges for the wood is based on the quantity that his customer buys. He also offers a discount to those customers that come to get the firewood themselves.

She would, nevertheless, like to expand the business, and is therefore asking for a loan of US$300."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":64614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business development","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Manono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.833333 -172.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-09-12T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-27T00:09:42Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-11-08T21:58:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78507,"comment":null},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T01:12:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94884,"comment":null},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T04:24:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124820,"comment":null},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T22:39:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148395,"comment":null},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-04-13T00:00:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":181059,"comment":null},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T07:12:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213771,"comment":null},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:37:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247744,"comment":null},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-08-31T07:40:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311750,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T01:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5351461,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-13T00:09:42Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T01:24:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18026,"name":"Aissatou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a group loan to be shared by the fifteen women of the Jeunes Femmes de Loudia (Young Women of Loudia) group, led by Ms. Aissatou D..

The young people of the village earn a living by farming in the case of men, and traveling trade in local products in the case of women.  In order to resolve the financial constraints to investing properly in their business activities, the young women of Loudia Oulof are requesting a loan of 500,000 francs ($1050) from SEM.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  The Jeunes Femmes de Loudia group have the following purposes: to create employment, to combat rural emigration, and to improve the living conditions of our families.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  These will consist of buying local products [dried fish, palm oil, cashews, etc.] and reselling them in surrounding villages and in local tourist hostels [where they command a higher price].  Cosmetic products will also be purchased in Ziguinchor [the nearest city] to be resold in the village.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

People there have difficult lives.  Since they do not easily get capital funds from the government or the banks, they often have to borrow money with a high rate of interest from loan sharks.  In 2003, TYM Fund opens a branch in this village and starts to lend the villagers money using microfinance.  Mrs. Ha Thi C.\u2019s family has become a member of TYM Fund since then.  At the age of 40, she is confident to borrow at the maximum limit.  She uses the fund on the right purpose and it clearly improves her life.  This time she wants to borrow $400 to buy rush to make sedge mats.  Besides working, Mrs. C. also spends a lot of time taking care of her parents.  She goes to class every other night and makes sedge mats with her parents during the others.  Everyday her family makes 2 mats, each is sold at $3.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nQu\u1ea3ng Kh\u00ea l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t x\u00e3 ngh\u00e8o n\u1eb1m ph\u00eda Nam huy\u1ec7n Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng, Thanh H\u00f3a. \u0110\u1eddi s\u1ed1ng ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n n\u01a1i \u0111\u00e2y g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, c\u00e1c ngu\u1ed3n v\u1ed1n kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ebfn \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c v\u1edbi ng\u01b0\u00f2i ngh\u00e8o h\u1ecd th\u01b0\u1eddng ph\u1ea3i vay n\u1eb7ng l\u00e3i.

breakfast.  Seeing this opportunity, Ms. Trinh Thi D. decided to open a breakfast restaurant.  It\u2019s been 10 years.  Customers go to her restaurant not just because food there is cheap but also because she also offers good quality.  If people come late, her food would be sold all out.  Considering quality and profit equal, she confides: \u201cThat quality always comes first is the reason why our store is able to stay in business and develop like it is today.  This time Ms. D. would like to borrow $400 to buy foodstuff, new table, chair, bowl, dishes for her restaurant.  She also wants to buy some pigs to breed. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nK\u1ec3 t\u1eeb ng\u00e0y \u0111\u1eddi s\u1ed1ng kinh t\u1ebf x\u00e3 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u00f9ng, Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n h\u01a1n, ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n c\u00f3 c\u1ee7a \u0103n c\u1ee7a \u0111\u1ec3, vi\u1ec7c \u0103n s\u00e1ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n ch\u00fa tr\u1ecdng, ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ecbnh Th\u1ecb \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng \u0111\u00e3 quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh m\u1edf qu\u00e1n \u0103n s\u00e1ng \u0111\u1ec3 ph\u1ee5c v\u1ee5 c\u00e1c th\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0111\u1ebf.

was born in 1959 and is a widow with six children.

She received and repaid six loans with which she raised money to pay school fees and buy food for her children. Given a loan of $1000, she plans to continue her business of pig fattening and yam and cassava cultivation so she can use the profits to continue educating her children.

P. has been in the trade business for 13 years.

After getting her first loan, Savri increased the variety of her inventory (she added men\u2019s sportswear), secured a better selling location  and had her son also join the business to help out.

By carefully investing the loaned funds, Mamlakat was able to establish a permanent place for her business at one of the central regional markets. Her husband helps Mamlakat in business.

The reason why he is looking for a loan is because he purchases goods from suppliers for cash. He does not have enough cash to be able to increase turnover, which will allow him to purchase goods cheaper. This is exactly why he came up with the idea of borowing money through MicroInvest.

She is married and has 3 children. She has a high school education. She lives together with her retired husband. Her children have families of their own and live separately from the parents. She lost her job after the disintegration of the USSR. Her husband was laid off as well. In order to not be financially dependent on her children and maintain her lifestyle she began working in sales. Back in 2003 her assets amounted to $150. She was selling children's clothing. Thanks to the loan and her commitment to the MicroInvest program she was able to increase her assets to $700. She was able to secure a permanent sales point and expanded her inventory to include children's shoes. In the future she is planing to procureanother sales point and increase turnover. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva
