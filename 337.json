He drives to various municipalities in Valle department to sell his product.  Many people buy from him because he comes to their very door selling his fruits and vegetables.  His short-term goal is to have a vegetable and fruit selling stand in Nacome's municipal market.  Having a stall in the market is very satisfying because sales there are very good.  However, getting a stall there is a bit difficult but he is determined to get it.  Yunior is a hard-working, tenacious young man with a strong will to succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":469687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-01-14T20:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yunior Joel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979652,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010718,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735080,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768538,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085985,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2646,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799834,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904987,"comment":null},{"amount":88.37,"local_amount":1641.22,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1670.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177468924,"comment":null},{"amount":51.63,"local_amount":958.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":975.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182606985,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de semilla de alverja y fertilizantes para la tierra, asegur\u00e1ndose en obtener un buen producto para ofrecerlo al mercado.","en":"At 63 years old, Francisco is a farmer by trade. He lives with 2 of his 14 children, who are the motivation for his sacrifice, in spite of his age. They are Olivia, 9 years old, and Di\u00f3genes, 20 years old. In addition, his wife Brigida, 57 years old, lives together with him in his cozy house, which is his own and is located in a pleasant area of the Peruvian highlands.\r\n<p>\r\nBesides planting oca and olluco (tuberous vegetables), potatoes, beans, barley, and cauliflower (food products native to the highlands), he would now like to plant peas this season, as he has done in past years with the help of his beloved wife Brigid and his children, who live with him and help him in their free time. For Francisdo, the most beautiful part of cultivating the land is seeing his products flourish and knowing that they will be of good quality. After endless days of effort, he will be able to sell them at a good price, based on his experience of previous harvests. The earnings obtained will useful to continue supporting his family. Furthermore, he has it in mind to begin to plant other fields that he left aside for lack of money, and thus he will be able to increase his production for the next harvests.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his ninth loan from MFP. As he relates, the best part of this opportunity to receive loans is succeeding in achieving his objectives and working with his organized community bank, where he is much loved by the other members for his punctuality and responsibility in making payments. The money that he is seeking will be invested in the purchase of pea seeds and fertilizers for his land, assuring that he will obtain a good product to offer to the market.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":469806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-14T23:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886665,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T02:29:00Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":168482,"name":"Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Desde hace 17 a\u00f1os en el mercado Central del departamento de Chinandega, la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora M. se ha dedicado al negocio de venta de embases pl\u00e1sticos los que son ofertados en su propio establecimiento donde los vende a diferentes precios de acuerdo al tama\u00f1o.\nEs importante destacar que hoy en d\u00eda se le est\u00e1n agotando los embases por lo que debe de realizar compras para continuar ofert\u00e1ndolos y por esta raz\u00f3n es que ella muy satisfecha acude a Ceprodel esperando ser beneficiada con el cr\u00e9dito y as\u00ed realizar la compra de los embases pl\u00e1sticos para obtener los ingresos.

T. is 36 and married with 5 children (ages 11-months - 17 years).  She owns a business venture, 0.  Matile has many years of experience in this business.  Matile needs a loan of WST $1750 To purcahse paints, fabrics and an elei board. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matile joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Matile's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matile T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.55 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 58 and married with 8 children (ages 26 - 37years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Malia has many years of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nIn 2008, Malia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Malia S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 32 and married with 4 children (ages 9-months - 16 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Gaumati has 3 years of experience in this business.  Gaumati needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 145 tala or US $60 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gaumati joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Gaumati's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Gaumati F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.63 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Faifua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faifua U. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.12 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 31 and married with 3 children (ages 5-months - 10 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lemau has many years of experience in this business.  Lemau needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Lemau joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lemau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Lemau L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.5 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.87 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 S. is 50 and married with 1 child (12-years old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faamaile  has many years of experience in this business.  Faamaile  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 90 tala or US $38 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faamaile  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faamaile 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faamaile  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.56 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.56 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

K. is 29 and married with 3 children (ages 5-months - 12 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Regina has 5 years of experience in this business.  Regina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 tala or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Regina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Regina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Regina K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 4-months - 10 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Elisapeta has 6 years of experience in this business.  Elisapeta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elisapeta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Elisapeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Elisapeta T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.66 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 N. is 35 and married with 4 children (ages 5 months - 13 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Lagomau  has 6 years of experience in this business.  Lagomau  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 162 tala or US $68 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lagomau  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagomau 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagomau  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.87 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.56 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Orepa has 6 years of experience in this business.  Orepa needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Orepa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Orepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Orepa V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is a 31-year old married woman who lives in Prk Consing Brgy Daga in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general (sari sari) store and a bakery.\r\n\r\nMarites husband, Razel, is a baker who co-owns the business with his wife.  They have 2 children, 6 and 7 years old.  One is currently going to school, and both help their mother sell goods in her general store.\r\n\r\nMarites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase the amount of money the family brings in, earning an average monthly income of Php 6,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMarites is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations and buy stock for her general store.  It had a positive impact in maintaining the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now Marites is borrowing her 12th loan, in the amount of Php 18,000, which she intends to use on the general store and the bakery.  Marites is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":469553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 6000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLetecia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 13000 was used to fund operations and buy inventory for her general store, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now Letecia is borrowing her 15th loan, in the amount of Php 13000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store. Letecia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":469525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

T. is a 44-year-old married woman who lives in Purok Consing, Barangay Daga, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.

They have five children from 13 to 22 years old, three of whom are working and help their parents with their household needs and two of whom are currently in school. All of them help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to earn an average monthly income of PHP 16,000 from her business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 was used to fund the operations of her furniture and fish vending. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 14th loan, for the amount of PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy supplies for her furniture-selling business, and also to maintain operations in her fish vending business.

In translation from Kirghiz the word \u201ckant\u201d means \u201csugar\u201d. However, in the past couple of years life in the city has been far from sweet. Many residents left the country in hope of finding stable employment elsewhere. The same fate was threatening Nurila and her husband. Additionally, they had four children to take care of. Traveling with them would have been uneasy at best and so Nurila\u2019s husband decided to stay and become a taxi driver. \r\nTapping into her savings, Nurila rented a container and started to sell foodstuffs. \r\nFinding a container in her home city proved problematic, however, they were able to rent one in a village twenty kilometers away. Her children had already grown and this business allowed them to remain in Kant. Her eldest daughter has already finished high school, while the rest of the children are still in school. In order to start her business, Nurila invested eight thousand soms ($180). Today her average monthly income is about ten thousand soms ($220). Nurila needs capital to invest into new products and increase her goods turnover. She also plans to buy some furniture and livestock for her household. \r\n\r\nNarila has three partners in her group: \r\n\r\nAijan is forty-four years old. Her husband is a construction worker. They have three children. Their two daughters are married and her son is in school. Aijan is a housewife. She raises livestock and sells it on the market. She makes up to ten thousand soms per month. She is requesting a loan in order to buy bull to fatten and sell. \r\n\r\nNurjan is forty-six years old. Her husband works as an electrician. She had tailored ethnic clothes and products but her friends recommended that she become a flour salesman. Nurjan decided to try it out and bought a couple bags of flour. Nurjan needs a loan to invest her capital in more flour. \r\n\r\nGulnara is forty years old. Her husband raises livestock. Gulnara works in the village of Ivanovka where she sells foodstuffs, candy and cookies. She is a mother of three children, all of which are attending school. Her eldest son will graduate this year. Gulnara is asking for a loan to buy some boxes of cookies and candy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Meripa has many years of experience in this business.  Meripa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Meripa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Meripa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meripa F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.45 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.55 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

K. is 51 and married with 6 children (ages 15 - 28 years).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Silivia has 7 years of experience in this business.  Silivia needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fish to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Silivia joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Silivia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Silivia K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.64 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 39 and married with 7 children (ages 1 - 16 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fiaaveifo has many years of experience in this business.  Fiaaveifo needs a loan of WST $1450 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 160 tala or US $67 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fiaaveifo joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiaaveifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiaaveifo L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

V. is 32 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 14 years).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Eseese has 7 years of experience in this business.  Eseese needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 221 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Eseese joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Eseese V. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 70 and married with 10 children (ages 21 - 40 years).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Nuuao needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 tala or US $125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nuuao joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nuuao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nuuao M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 56 and married with 5 children (ages 12 - 26).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Soli has many years of experience in this business.  Soli needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Soli joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Soli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Soli L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.9 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 58 and married with no children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting   variety of vegetables for sale.  Leiua has many years of experience in this business.  Leiua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leiua joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Leiua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leiua L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.23 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

I. is 39 and married with 3 children (ages 5 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ela has many years of experience in this business.  Ela needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 tala or US $108 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nIn 2008, Ela joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Nelly Vai has many years of experience in this business.  Nelly Vai needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 tala or US $146 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nelly Vai joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nelly Vai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nelly Vai Aliifale are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 29 and married with 2 children (ages 2 and 6).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Katerina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Katerina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Katerina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Katerina E. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.89 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. Zinagul, who is 47 years old and a widow, is the leader of this group. \r\n\r\nWhen Zinagul lost her husband, she was left with three children. For her, the question was \"to be or not to be.\" However, as her life itself has proven, Zinagul courageously withstood all the obstacles in her way and has safely made it through. \r\n\r\nZinagul set a goal to help all her children get firmly on their feet so that they would never feel need. To accomplish this, she undertook two jobs. She worked as a high school teacher during the day. At home after work, she started manufacturing handicrafts for sale in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nShe has continued this way for six years. Now her children are grown and earn their living themselves. Her eldest daughter goes to college. One of her sons works as a builder. Recently he bought a car. Another son works in an electric station. Zinagul is happy that her children are gradually getting on their feet. \r\n\r\nZinagul still manufactures handicrafts for her permanent long-term customers. Her monthly income from selling the items, though, is only $65.00 US dollars. \r\n\r\nZinagul decided to apply for this loan to buy a cow for milk and for breeding. She wants to sell milk to create an additional income source for her family. Her next plan is to help her son get married. \r\n\r\nZinagul\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\n--Gulmira, 42, has one son and a set of twins. Her husband works as a stoker at school. Gulmira is a housewife, but because of frequent electricity outages, she has been selling gas in plastic bottles. Gulmira needs a loan to buy coal. \r\n\r\n--Berdibek, 34, has two children. Berdibek makes iron gates for homes and works as a welder. He needs a loan to buy metal for making gates.\r\n\r\n--Karyibek, 34, is a father of four children. He trades in coal and grows potatoes. Karyibek needs a loan to purchase ten tons of coal. \r\n\r\n--Taalaigul, 27, has two children. Her husband works as a builder. Taalaigul is a housewife. She rears her children. Taalaigul and her husband need a loan to purchase coal for winter.   \r\n\r\n--- Where did this loan come from? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Malienafau has many years of experience in this business.  Malienafau needs a loan of WST $1450 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Malienafau joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malienafau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malienafau M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 37 and married with 4 children (ages 6 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Kuini has many years of experience in this business.  Kuini needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kuini joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Kuini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kuini F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C. Salamat is the leader of this group. \r\n\r\nSalamat is 58 years old. Her husband for the last several years has been retired. However, Salamat has a daughter, who is 20 years old. Therefore, there is nobody to provide for Salamat\u2019s family except herself and her husband, who sometimes offers welding services. Besides, Salamat\u2019s daughter is temporarily unemployed. \r\n\r\nSalamat has a job as a seamstress in a sewing section. At the same time, she raises cattle together with her husband. Thus they provide for themselves, not depending on anybody\u2019s support. \r\n\r\nThey started out keeping cattle, just as most people do in their village. Then Salamat\u2019s husband decided to start trading in cattle. He used his entrepreneurship skills to start trading in sheep. Later, they obtained a loan and started increasing their herds. Now they have eighteen sheep and four cows. However, Salamat only manages to earn $45.00 US per month from selling milk. Salamat decided to apply for this loan to buy four sheep for breeding. Now they are making preparations for the feast in honor of their grandson. \r\n\r\nSalamat\u2019s partners are:  \r\n\r\n--Iygilik, 30, is a father of two daughters. To provide for the family, his wife works as a saleswoman, whereas he is an operator. They need a loan to buy coal. In the near future, Iygilik hopes to buy a car as he has been planning for quite a long time.\r\n\r\n--Sveta, 33, is a mother of two sons. She works as a schoolteacher and her husband is a leading specialist in an organization. Sveta hopes to obtain this loan and buy two sheep for breeding. Sveta wants to raise sheep because her and her husband's salaries (hers is $45.00 US; his is $90.00 US) are not sufficient for the family's needs. \r\n\r\n--Tolokan, 44, has a son. Her husband also raises cattle, trades in them in a cattle market during weekends and works as a tractor driver. Tolokan works as a nurse in a kindergarten. Tolokan has applied for this loan to purchase some cattle for feeding and resale. \r\n\r\n--- Where did this loan come from? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 210 tala or US $88 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nIn 2008, Lolo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 S. is 31 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 10).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Apitaila  has many years of experience in this business.  Apitaila  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 tala or US $65 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Apitaila  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Apitaila 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Apitaila  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 27 and married with 4 children (ages 1 month - 6 years).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Eka has 7 years of experience in this business.  Eka needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eka joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eka's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eka S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.56 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

R. is 32 and married with 3 children (ages 2 - 9).  She is starting a business venture, sewing different kinds of clothes and dresses .  Matelani needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase a new sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 125 tala or US $52 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Matelani joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Matelani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matelani R. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 35 and married with 1 child (6 years-old).  She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Paese has 7 years of experience in this business.  Paese needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Paese joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Paese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Paese L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.22 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.56 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 41 and married with 1 child (8 years-old).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Sau has many years of experience in this business.  Sau needs a loan of WST $1800 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sau joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sau T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.69 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.66 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 60 and married with 7 children (ages 16 - 38).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Asiasiga has many years of experience in this business.  Asiasiga needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 talas or US $65 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Asiasiga joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Asiasiga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is starting a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Vaifafo needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in renovating the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vaifafo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaifafo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaifafo F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 27 and married with 2 children (ages 5 and 10).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Menime needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 111 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Menime joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Menime's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Menime S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 43 and married with 5 children (ages 10 - 21).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Lagimaina has 6 years of experience in this business.  Lagimaina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 tala or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lagimaina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lagimaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagimaina A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 53 and married with 6 children (ages 13 - 30).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Viia has many years of experience in this business.  Viia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Viia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Viia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Viia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

I. is 45 and married with 8 children (ages 2 - 29).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lesa has many years of experience in this business.  Lesa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 tala or US $146 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lesa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lesa I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 48 and married with 5 children (ages 6 - 27).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Totoa has many years of experience in this business.  Totoa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 168 tala or US $70 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Totoa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Totoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Totoa L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.54 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 N. is 46 and married with 2 children (ages 15 and 21).  She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Vaaipu  has many years of experience in this business.  Vaaipu  needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 360 tala or US $150 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaaipu  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vaaipu 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaaipu  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.78 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.88 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

I. is 45 and married with 5 children (ages 6 - 18).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Matuu has many years of experience in this business.  Matuu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matuu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Matuu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matuu I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

G. is 45 and married with 4 children (ages 8 - 21).  She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tauinaola has many years of experience in this business.  Tauinaola needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tauinaola joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tauinaola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tauinaola G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Merenaite has many years of experience in this business.  Merenaite needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 180 tala or US $75 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merenaite joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Merenaite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Merenaite F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 43 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 18).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Lina has many years of experience in this business.  Lina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 80 tala or US $33 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 46 and married with 5 children (ages 9 - 19).  She owns a business venture, baking & selling a variety of confectionaries such cookies and cakes in the local community.  Faamanuia has 7 years of experience in this business.  Faamanuia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase baking equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faamanuia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faamanuia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faamanuia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 25 and single with no children.  She is starting a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Luaiva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 90 tala or US $38 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luaiva joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Luaiva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Luaiva T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 41 and married with 5 children (ages 8 - 23).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Palanitina has many years of experience in this business.  Palanitina needs a loan of WST $1100 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 140 tala or US $58 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Palanitina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Palanitina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Palanitina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. is 35 and married with 1 child (8 years-old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Siatuvai has 5 years of experience in this business.  Siatuvai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 190 tala or US $79 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Siatuvai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siatuvai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siatuvai E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.22 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is starting a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Petimani needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 195 tala or US $81 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Petimani joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Petimani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Petimani E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.66 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

One child is already working and helping to support the rest of the family. The other two children are currently going to school and also helping their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nBella S. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nBella S. is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 29,500 was used to fund the operations of her business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 19th loan of Php 29,500 which she intends to use to buy inventory (frozen foods) for her business. Bella S. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

A. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 54 years old, is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Elvera owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Elvera has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elvera joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elvera is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan which Elvera has taken out  from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":470166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sokhy S. lives in Cheav Bdei Khang Kaeut village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a 2.5-hectare field where she cultivates rice. On this plantation, she now faces some problems because her field has infertile soil and is far from the irrigation system.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling specialty food products such as processed soya milk, locally called \"taho\" (a combination of soya milk and sugar syrup), in the local community. Jovito has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Jovito joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Jovito is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be his second from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a humble farmer, dedicated to the production of such crops as potatoes, onions, wheat, and corn. He is encouraged when the harvest of his land is plentiful, and he wants to increase his harvests in order to attain better results. He is also aware that his vegetables have to be of a better quality in order to be able to sell them for more income. However, in order to do that, he needs to invest large amounts of money. In addition to his crops, Abduvosit is also engaged in raising livestock. He has applied to IMON International for a loan in the amount of 5,000 Somoni, which will be used both to increase his crop production and to purchase more cattle to breed.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and was the site of the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country, home to epic mountain passes, contains communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and its civilization dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country\u2019s agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together with her husband they have three children. She runs a business where she sells kids' shoes at the busy central market in Istaravshan. Mutahira started her business 11 years ago and has run it with both extreme care and seriousness. It is an important source of income for her family of five, considering her husband is currently unemployed.\r\n\r\nMutahira has requested a loan of 5,000 Somoni so that she can purchase additional inventory of winter boots for kids and to continue developing her business. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 54 years old and he is a hard worker. He is marrid with 3 children. Nabi has been farming since 2004. He has six years of experience, and he has been able to support his family by learning how to take care and manage his crops in the short growing season. \r\n\r\nNabi aspires to have more farming equipment and more farming supplies so that he can work his land much more productively. Due to lack of funds has not been able to do so. He is asking for a loan to purchase more farming supplies, such as herbicides, fertilizer and other necessities, in order to appropriately manage his crops, and, in the end, make a profit. This request is in support of making his dream come true, and Nabi is asking for help from your generous heart. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

O. is 36 years old. He is married with 4 children. O. works in agriculture and has always been efficient in his labors. The role of father, which he has carried out for 15 years, has helped him to understand the sacrifice and hard labor of the women of the house. He grows potatoes, onions, carrots, and other kinds of vegetables in his garden. O. dreams of all of his children being well-educated with a bright future. That\u2019s why he works from early morning till late at night. He wants to borrow a loan of 4500 Somoni so he can buy mineral fertilizer, fuels, and lubricants. This request is in support of making his dream come true, and O. is asking for help from your generous heart.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 37 years old and married with four children. Tilov is a farmer. He has been working in agriculture for four years. In that time, he has gained much experience and a love for the land. Tilov began cultivating his land through his own efforts and has gradually gotten ahead in life. He has been producing crops such as potatoes, onions, carrots and vegetables. Each year, he produces a yield sufficient for his family's consumption and for selling. At the same time, he runs a business of raising and selling cattle. \r\n\r\nToday he is asking for a loan in the amount of 3,500 Somoni. Tilov would like to use this loan to buy supplies for the harvest and for improving production, and thus increase the quality of his yield along with his earnings at the time of sale. Tilov and his family are counting on your help. He thanks all who support him and promises to repay the loan in time.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

2006, Boikuzi has been a livestock farmer. He breeds calves and cows. He is married and has two children whom he needs to support and give a proper education to. Boikuzi has improved his financial situation because he has been able to use the loans he has received from IMON International wisely to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the areas surrounding his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He became involved in agriculture twelve years ago, since his parents were farmers. For this reason he is giving his very best to his land, where he is busy all day long. The harvest is what gives him the most pleasure from his work, since he can pick the products that cost him so much work cultivating and caring for.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the most difficult thing is acquiring the mineral fertilizer, fuels and lubricants necessary for his plots, since these things are very expensive and they raise the level of investment required in production. Valijon draws strength from his two children, whom he supports so that they may become professionals. He wishes to invest in the various fertilizers he needs for his crops, so that he can increase his production and his profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is the divorced mother of two adult children. She has been selling women\u2019s clothing in the central city market for about five years, running her own small venture successfully. The secret of her success is simple: she tries to not only let her customers know the benefits of her products, she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sifatmo doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is at with her venture. She is seeking a loan of $800 USD to re-stock the merchandise in her store.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Sifatmo\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing her customers will encourage new customers to buy from her and determine her further success.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This was the reason that she decided to start her own business four years ago selling the fabrics of the national dresses.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Gulbahor has made her business grow and, by allowing her clients to pay in installments, her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally.\r\n\r\nHowever, Gulbahor would like to continue bettering her household so that her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of $800 with which she will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses. The power to help her business to grow is in your hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mas tarde nace la iniciativa de vender comida a los trabajadores de la empresa que queda en frente de su vivienda. Lo cual fue hablar con el propietario y trabajadores para ofrecer sus servicios de venta de comida el cual la empresa le da el local del comedor para poder atender en las mejores condiciones a sus trabajadores, el cual fue un buen inicio ya que no le cobran el alquiler y vende su comida el cual da la quincena a si como al contado.

She married young and had three children, all of whom are in school. Her husband is an accountant and has been very generous. When she began working, her husband bought her a small bus with their savings so she could drive a route for students. With the revenue made from the bus, she started selling different flavored drinks out of her home to have another source of income to help pay basic household costs like water, electricity, telephone, and school as well as bus costs. Later she had the idea to sell food to the workers of the office in front of her house. She talked to the owner and the workers in the building and offered her services. The business let her use the cafeteria to be able to attend the workers. It was a good start because they do not charge her rent and she can sell her food, which allows her to get paid biweekly and with cash.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Ana hopes to be able to increase the variety of food she sells. She will buy meat, chicken, rice, beans, oil, condiments, dairy products, and soft drinks. She wants to buy baked goods and sweets and new utensils for preparing the food so she can give better service each day.

The partner was born in the Sicuani province located in the Cusco department. Our partner is 40 years old and is married with 4 children aged 18, 14, 12 and 5 years old. He has been working for over 11 years as a guard in the education industry and 4 years ago decided to open his own carpentry shop. Our partner fulfilled his dream of opening the woodshop and was able to do it slowly with the right tools, but he is so good at what he does that now he gets more laborious jobs for which he needs some machinery to make his work more efficient. Our partner is now requesting the loan to be able to purchase the machinery. The partner is grateful and expresses his satisfaction to be able to continue growing his own business and is committed to fulfill the payment of the debt in the established period.\r\n \r\n<br

This structural crisis was marked by a significant reduction in purchasing power for Senegalese people and especially those from the least privileged social classes. Entire families failed to meet their food and healthcare needs. It was this desire to find a way to increase their purchasing power that has encouraged these women to start producing and selling cakes that are very much in demand by the local population.\r\n\r\nPutting in place these ovens gives women better access to baking facilities with reduced production costs and will allow them to maximize their profits in this business. The oven will be open to all women who bake cakes and production will take place in town. The women hope to take orders to make cakes for ceremonies and other special occasions. \r\n\r\nThis text was translated from the original French, below:\r\n\r\nLe d\u00e9veloppement du petit commerce surtout du commerce de d\u00e9tail a connu une effervescence \u00e0 partir de la d\u00e9valuation mon\u00e9taire des ann\u00e9es 1980 survenu au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

C\u2019est dans le souci d\u2019une recherche quotidienne de l\u2019accroissement de leur pouvoir d\u2019achat que ces femmes s\u2019adonnent \u00e0 la production et \u00e0 la commercialisation de g\u00e2teaux tr\u00e8s sollicit\u00e9s par les populations. \r\n\r\nLa mise en place de ces four participera \u00e0 la facilitation d\u2019acc\u00e8s des femmes au four \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction des charges de production pour maximiser leurs b\u00e9n\u00e9fices dans la mise en ouvre de ce commerce.\r\nLe four sera ouvert \u00e0 toutes les femmes productrices de g\u00e2teaux et la production sera \u00e9coul\u00e9e dans la ville. Les commandes de g\u00e2teaux pour les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies et autres f\u00eates seront exploit\u00e9es par ces femmes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":470522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Economic Development Units are groups of 10 people that have a bank account and that meet weekly or bi-weekly to make their payments.  The unit has a representative and a governing board.  This group is in the San Luis community in the state of VeraC..  It has 11 members.  The group representative is Juana R. A., 38, who is married and has three children, 1 girl and 2 boys; she finished third grade.  She sells snacks and needs funding to buy the ingredients she needs like:  meat, masa (dough for tortillas), vegetables, and kitchen utensils.  Her customers say that she cooks delicious, well-seasoned dishes.  Even though she opens only on week-ends, her establishment is very clean.  Juana wants this loan so that her business will grow, to earn profits to reinvest in her snack sales, and to earn higher profits so that she and her children can have a better standard of living.  Emilia O. Gonz\u00e1lez, 46, is on the governing board of this group.  She finished 6th grade and has 3 children, one girl and 2 boys.  She sells groceries and needs funding to stock her store.  She will buy rice, cooking oil, beans, soups, sweet beverages and cookies.  Her customers say that she is very kind and responsible and she opens for business very early.  In the future, she would like to enlarge her store because it is a bit small.  Emilia wants this loan to enlarge her business, to earn better profits to reinvest to have a better-stocked store and, in the future, to enlarge her store.  The other nine members are: Hilda P.

Los fines de semana, vende discos de m\u00fasica en las diferentes ferias de su localidad, con la ayuda incondicional de su esposo, quien dice que aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar sin miedo, ni verg\u00fcenza a las actividades a las que se dedica junto a Florentina. \nAmbos relatan que antes no ten\u00edan ni qu\u00e9 comer y se sent\u00edan impotentes de ver llorar de hambre a sus hijos e incluso por un plato de comida llegaron a vender los pocos art\u00edculos dom\u00e9sticos que hab\u00edan obtenido; \u201crecordar esas cosas me ayudan para salir adelante\u201d manifiesta ella, a la vez que se dice \u201ccon Dios a mi lado ya nada me falta, al contrario tengo para compartir con los dem\u00e1s\u201d. \nAhora sus oficios son rentables y le permiten ahorrar, por lo que para el futuro se proyecta a implementar una tienda de discos de m\u00fasica y videos cristianos para hacer llegar la palabra de Dios a sus semejantes, y tambi\u00e9n desea ampliar su negocio de venta de frutas. \n\nEste es el s\u00e9ptimo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y cuenta que se gan\u00f3 la confianza de la entidad por ser muy responsable y cumplida en sus pagos; adem\u00e1s le gusta trabajar en su banco comunal y est\u00e1 muy agradecida porque debido a estos cr\u00e9ditos tiene un pr\u00f3spero negocio. El dinero que ahora solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s discos para venderlos en las ferias como comerciante ambulante, por ahora, hasta tener su propio local.\n","en":"Florentina is a kind and enterprising 41 year old woman.  She lives with her 44 year old husband, \u00c1ngel, and with two of their six children.  They are Karen, 11, and Jaqueline, 4.  Her house is rented but very cozy.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years she has been selling fruit that is native to the central Peruvian jungle.  But, in the mornings she sells food at a parking lot.  On the week ends she sells musical discs at the different fairs in her area.  She has her husband\u2019s unconditional help.  He says that he learned to do the same work with Florentina without fear or shame.  \r\n\r\nThey both say that before they did not even have anything to eat, and they felt helpless seeing their children cry from hunger.  They even sold the few domestic goods they had for one plate of food.  \u201cRemember that these things help me to get ahead,\u201d is what she says.  She also says, \u201cWith God at my side, I do not need anything.  To the contrary, I have enough to share with the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow her jobs are profitable, and they allow her to save.  In the future she plans to set up a store with musical discs and Christian videos to bring the word of God to others.  She also hopes to expand her fruit selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She explains that she won the confidence of the institution by being very responsible and making her payments.  Also, she likes to work with her communal bank.  She is very grateful because she has a prosperous business due to these loans.  She will use the money she is now requesting to buy more discs to sell at the fairs.  She will work as a traveling salesperson until she gets her own location.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

","en":"Marco, 23, is single.   He lives with his mother, Valentina, 63, and with 2 of his 4 siblings:  Marcos, 25 and Elizabeth, 20.  They rent their house, which is in a pleasant town far from the city in the Peruvian mountains.  He has been a farmer for the past 5 years; he grows potato, corn, peas and gladioli in several different colors.  He owns his fields so he cares for them with much dedication and sacrifice in order to obtain good crops.  Marco also buys about-to-be-harvested choclo (corn) crops and flowers to sell at market.  His siblings Marcos and Elizabeth are his always-reliable helpers because they, too, want to provide their mother with a peaceful old-age.  In addition, they plan to form their own families so they work hard to get ahead.  What Marco likes best about his work is selling the products he grows because they produce good profits.  As he, himself, states: \u201cI have farming in my blood and in my memories, from that past time when my father taught me to love crops.\u201d  In the future, he would like to open a flower shop in a centrally-located place in the city to sell flowers daily in all their various varieties and colors.

educaci\u00f3n. La vivienda en la que ella vive es propia.\n\nEl oficio que desempe\u00f1a todos los d\u00edas es el comercio de comestibles, productos de primera necesidad y perfumer\u00eda. Paralelamente y desde hace 15 a\u00f1os cultiva pl\u00e1tanos, palta, c\u00edtricos oriundos de la selva peruana, actividades que realiza sola, porque seg\u00fan cuenta le gusta todo de sus labores y ya est\u00e1 acostumbrada a despertarse a tempranas horas de la madrugada para atender a su amado esposo y a los clientes madrugadores que van a su tienda principalmente en busca de pan, leche, chocolate para el desayuno.\nPor las noches se va a descansar muy tarde pues en la zona donde vive no hay tiendas y pese a que su establecimiento est\u00e9 cerrado los vecinos tocan la puerta para ser atendidos, \u201cyo no me molesto, porque sino los atiendo a d\u00f3nde ir\u00edan a comprar los pobres\u201d, refiere Ninda, a la vez que enfatiza que con las ganancias de su tienda educa a sus hijos y cubre la manutenci\u00f3n de su casa, por lo que considera muy rentables sus actividades.\nComo es una mujer emprendedora tiene planeado implementar otra tienda de abarrotes o ferreter\u00eda al otro lado de su domicilio, adem\u00e1s ya concluy\u00f3 de construir el segundo piso de su casa y piensa convertirlo en un hospedaje tur\u00edstico.\n\nEsta es la quinta vez que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y est\u00e1 muy agradecida porque considera que desde que trabaja con su banco comunal su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica ha mejorado y ahora tiene aspiraciones porque sabe que la instituci\u00f3n la ayudar\u00e1, respondiendo con puntualidad y cumplimiento de sus pagos.

They have four children who no longer live with them since they have moved to the capital in search of a better future and a good education.  Ninda and her husband live in their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works every day selling food, basic necessities, and toiletries.  At the same time, for the past 15 years, Ninda has been growing bananas, avocados, and citrus fruits native to the Peruvian jungle.  She manages her businesses by herself and enjoys her work.  Ninda is already accustomed to waking up early so that she can tend to her beloved husband and the early-rising customers who come to her general store to buy bread, milk, and chocolate for breakfast. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the evenings, she takes a rest.  Since there are no stores that are open late, she has neighbors who come by to her establishment when it is closed and knock on her door requesting to be served.  \u201cIt does not bother me because the poor have no other place to shop,\u201d says Ninda.  She considers her business to be very profitable and emphasizes that her earnings have enabled her to educate her children and cover the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAs an entrepreneur, she has plans to open another grocery store or hardware store across from her home.  In addition, she wants to finish construction of the second floor of her house and turn it into a tourist lodge.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  Ninda is very grateful because she believes working with her Communal Bank has helped improve her economic situation.  She now has aspirations because she knows the Institution will support her.  In return, Ninda has been responsible in completing her payments on time.  She plans to use the money she requested to buy enough merchandise in order to take advantage of the upcoming festivities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":470562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T23:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ninda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124446,"comment":null},{"amount":120.72,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960187,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993031,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717817,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751492,"comment":null},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933959,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-16T03:14:02Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":168848,"name":"Rosas De Apa\u00f1a Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nROSAS DE APA\u00d1A es un banco de emprendimiento formado por 10 integrantes de las zonas de Ovejuyo y Apa\u00f1a, son personas que se dedican al comercio informal y otras actividades como el transporte, sus representantes fueron elegidos por voto en asamblea siendo elegida como presidenta la Sra Angelica que se dedica a la venta de comida, La tesorera Salome vende cosmeticos en distintas zonas, como secretario el Sr Oscar Que trabaja como transportista.\n\nForman parte de la base la Sra Elena Quien vende verduras, el Sr Victor es transportista, Eugenia  Vende Comida en su Kiosko, La Sra Evarista se dedica a la venta de verduras, y el Sr. Antonio es transportista, la Sra Carmen Basilia trabaja con el minibus de su esposo y la Sra Claudia que vende cosmeticos por catalogo. estas son las actividades que ellos desarrollan dia a dia para sostener a sus familias y usaran el prestamo par extender sus negocios y en otros casos empezar uno.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTodos los integrantes estan agradecidos con Emprender  y  Kiva por la confianza brindada en la otorgacion del credito.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"The Communal Bank \u201cRosas de Apa\u00f1a\u201d was started by ten members from the districts of Ovejuyo and Apa\u00f1a.

She has always been independent so she wasn\u2019t much bothered by her separation from her husband; her aim in life has always been to get ahead.  She has been a public servant for the last 22 years (she works for a government entity) in a very large province.  She likes to be in permanent contact with people so, for the last 5 years, she has sold beauty products as well as some food items.  Besides, she\u2019s also a farmer; she has banana, avocado and corn crops.  For this last activity, she gets help from her parents who consider Sonia a \u201cJack-of-all-trades\u201d because she is so active.  At her age, she feels that her office work is all-consuming and the pressure and demands made on her sometimes are uncomfortable.  Because of this, her greatest wish is to be able to live in the countryside since farming provides her with the tranquility she needs.  Her activities are quite profitable and, thanks to them, she is able to meet her family\u2019s main needs.  For the future, she would like to be a star saleswoman of the products she offers and consumes as well as increasing her farming output.  This is her fourth loan request to MFP and she is very happy.  She also states that she enjoys working with her communal bank because the members are exacting, responsible, and follow the by-laws well, as it should be, always respectful of others.

The reasons were that the husband stood for the divorce thinking that the inheritance would be taken and since he was abroad, they divorced. During the marriage, they had 4 children. Three of her children are married and live independently, away from home. Only her single, 27 year old son lives at home and he helps with her business. He does not have his own house because he is renting.\r\n\r\nBlanca has had a store for 10 years. She works from 6 a.m. to 10 p. m., working from Sunday to Sunday and never closing because she has a faithful clientele. If things go well now that she has a large selection of merchandise, she will have a good bond of friendship with all of her communal bank partners. She is in her second cycle of working with the loans from the foundation and it has been beneficial for stocking her business a little more. She tells us that she was influenced to join the bank by her friend Marlene, who is a member. With the new loan that she receives from the foundation, she is going to invest in the purchase of products for her store like rice, sugar, noodles etc. Since all of the products are expensive and she needs to stock her store. Her biggest dream would be to keep her health, so she can continue working. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva

Her children are not acknowledged by their biological father, who should be contributing toward child support and household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys tells us she lives in a highly agricultural area where most of the population grows flowers and fruits, such as apples, peaches, and plums, as well as engages in animal husbandry.  She decided to raise guinea pigs and chickens to sell at the Gualaceo Market.  \r\n<p>\r\nMotivated by her friends, Gladys joined the Communal Bank and has now participated in six loan cycles with the Foundation.  The loans have allowed her to succeed in her business and help her children get ahead.  With this new loan, Gladys says she will purchase feed for her animals such as grasses, corn, and vitamins.  Her goal is to grow her business over time so that she can continue supporting her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The community of La Estancia is in the Paute region and is known for its high production of flowers and fruits, such as apples, peaches, and plums, as well as its natural beauty.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia R. is a member \u201cLa Estancia\u201d Communal Bank and was convinced by the other members to join.  She is a single mother with five children.  Her older children work and contribute toward the household expenses.  At 42 years of age, Julia feels at peace because she has her own home.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia engages in her household chores, but she also raises chickens and guinea pigs to sell at a farming cooperative in her community.  This is her fifth loan cycle with the Foundation.  Her previous loans have helped her to gradually grow her business.  She will use this loan to purchase more guinea pigs and the grasses needed to feed them.

She has worked on this humble business for more than 8 years. She started as an apprentice in a friend's beauty shop, but she is very smart because she enjoyed the work very much and enjoyed each task of this activity. In addition she had her two children under her responsibility whom she had to feed every day. Little by little she progressed until she established her own beauty shop. She faced challenges such as paying the rent of her business' locale because the owner increases the rent every year, but each day she offers the best of her services in order to gain more customers. The loan she requests is to be used as working capital to buy perfumes, lotions, dyes, peroxide, conditioners, shampoo and hair treatments which are the products she uses the most. Her hope is to keep moving forward and become known for offering and excellent service and very good quality.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva

families. All of them live in Cuenca, a city which is the third most important in the country and known for the beauty of its Andean landscape.\r\n\r\nRosa Guam\u00e1n is a member of the Porvenir communal bank. She lives in the city of Cuenca near the cemetary. She is 61 years old and married. Her husband is retired from the electric company and together they have 2 children, 30 and 28 years old, who are single and who help the household financially. Through their efforts over the years, this couple is managing to finish building their house although they still need to do the windows and a few other things.\r\n\r\nRosa has been working in her restaurant for the past 9 years and tells us that it is going well, as her she has it in her house and does not have to pay any rent. Her working hours are from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m.. One of her aunts taught her how to prepare her products and she also learned from books and cooking magazines as well as from experience.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan cycle with the foundation, and it was her sister who encouraged her to become part of this very happy group. With this new loan she is going to buy rice, oil, sugar, salt and many other goods that she needs for the restaurant.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to grow her business and to have more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":470760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase rice, sugar, salt, oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-17T19:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rosa Etelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074713,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074714,"comment":null},{"amount":149.32,"local_amount":146,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":149.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910697,"comment":null},{"amount":19.43,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":19.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946350,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946351,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946352,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674663,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674664,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708831,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708832,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-17T23:53:05Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":168917,"name":"Qabil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qabil J. is 41 years old, and is married with three adorable children.
