He feels a great love for her because she took care of him after his mother abandoned him when he was a boy.  His grandmother taught him about responsibility and work.\r\n\r\nHe devotes himself to planting coffee, bananas, and chilies.  At the same time, he is studying for a career in the agricultural industry.  He goes to a technology institution in the city every day from seven in the morning until one in the afternoon.  To do so, he travels two hours by car. When he returns home at three or four in the afternoon, he takes care of his crops.  On the week ends he gathers his bananas, which he sells for 5 soles for twenty-five pounds (12 kilos) to the buyers who come to his farm.  \r\n\r\nHis dreams for the future are to proudly finish his career, and to fully devote himself to his crops.  They are his only source of income.  That is why he values and takes care of each one of his plants.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP, where he is recognized for his responsibility.  When he cannot attend a meeting of his communal bank, he gives the money for his payment to the treasurer.  The money from the loan he is now asking for is to plant chilies on another one of his farms.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":402339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To prepare his land for the next planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oxapampa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10.333333 -75.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-08T18:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1512,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751083,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-09T01:55:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142735,"name":"Rosa Argentina","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el Mercado Central de Le\u00f3n, la se\u00f1ora Rosa C. se destaca por vender sus productos comestibles como atoles elaborados por ella misma y ofrecidos ambulantemente en las calles del mercado.\n\nLa raz\u00f3n por la que ha acudido a Ceprodel es para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de la materia prima como lo es el pan, la leche y los dulces.

She lives in the district Predios del Recreo, where she has lived for 9 years.  She has many regular customers since the type of products she sells for the most part only last for one month of use.

In the same spirit of hard work, Mar\u00eda turns herself into a chef on the weekends, making nacatamales, which she sells on Friday nights from 4-10pm, and on Saturday mornings from 8-11am.  Mar\u00eda is very motivated to succeed, and she tells us that she feels very happy because things have been going well for her, and she hopes that they will continue to improve even more.

In this place people organize themselves to monitor their community forest; they form tree conservation brigades to protect the environment, because it's where they get food and raw material for handicrafts.  Nati, as she is called by her family, has three minor children, the youngest of which is 9 years old.  She has not lived with her husband for some years; as a result she assumed the responsibility for her children and since then she has worked hard to support her family.  Se\u00f1ora Natalia wishes to invest in the handcrafted production of ocoshal (beautiful pieces made of woven pine fibers collected from the forest) and in transportation to sell these handicrafts in other regions.  Nati normally collects the dry pine fibers on her own in the forest after this material has fallen off of the trees, and then transforms these fibers into beautiful handcrafted pieces with a very natural aroma.  She wishes to continue investing in this activity and aspires to have sufficient resources to achieve its commercialization in other regions where there are no sales.

V.\r\nFantasia Gruoup\r\n<p>\r\nLeydi lives in the Indian community of Crescencio Morales in the municipality of Zitacuaro, Michoac\u00e1n.  This is a small town steeped in ancestral traditions and customs.\r\n<p>\r\nLeydi is 25 years old and is a young person accustomed to working hard in order to achieve her goals.  For two years, she studied to become a hairstylist.  In order to pursue her course work, Leydi had to awaken at 5:00 in the morning to bring guavas, wildflowers, mushrooms and churros to Zitacuaro to sell from very early in the day at some of the open air markets in the town.   In the afternoons, she worked in a caf\u00e9 that is located outside the institute where she studied. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, her greatest wish is to have the basic products necessary in order to start a hair styling business in her community.  She wants to begin with a simple establishment where she can cut hair, provide hairdos, and repair nails and where people interested in this service, primarily young people who attend school, can get their hair cut in the community.\r\n<p>\r\nLeydi is an independent young woman accustomed to looking after herself because, when she was very small, her parents left her under the care of her grandparents, who were already very old, and now she has the responsibility of caring for them.  Her greatest dream is to have her salon where she can offer her services to the community and from which she can obtain income in order to support herself and her grandparents.\r\n<br

I. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 32 years old. Rosenda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rosenda owns & operates a \"sari-sari\" retail store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Rosenda has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosenda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosenda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosenda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosenda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Bernadette has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bernadette joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bernadette is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP that she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Bernadette's first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

C. is 11 years older than her husband, Jovanni C., who is now 30 years old. They were blessed with 3 children, John Errol, who is 21 years old, Van Dawelle, who is 8 years old, and Anwka Chloe, who is 3 months old. Her husband works for a family, but his salary, while useful as one source of their income, is not enough to cover their household expenses and their children's tuition.\r\n\r\nSo Magdalena had to think of another way for them to earn extra income to augment small income of her husband, even though he works hard. She decided to start a fishing business. She and her husband built a fish cage that located in the sea near their house. This business gives them extra income and fits well in their lives.\r\n\r\nWhen she joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), Magdalena used the loan that she received to start her business. Now she has decided to request another loan. She will use the loan funds to buy supplies for her business, such as bundles of fishnet, different kind of rope, fingerlings, and some bamboo to expand her fish cage.\r\n\r\nMagdalena\u2019s hope is that God will give her a long life so that she canhelp her children and grandchildren to cope up with life and give them a better future, especially her youngest child. And she also hopes that, someday, her business bring them success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":402578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"For additional

Sopheap Y. is a villager in Kaos Nhai village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who own small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn for a living. Aside from this, she is a breeder who breeds cow, pigs and chicken.

Sylvia and her entire family live in a house with two bed rooms, one sitting room and a kitchen. Being a very hard working woman, she has overcome challenges in her life such as her husband's bad attitude, excessive drinking, smoking and returning home very late at night. \r\n<p>\r\nSylvia runs a koki and palm wine selling business with the support of her children and her now reformed husband. She will invest the loan to buy koki beans to produce koki pudding which they eat with plantains, potatoes or yams. She also plans to invest the loan in palm wine (white stuff).  With her  previous loans she provided her community with white stuff (white liquid from raffia palms) for their social activities. With this loan, she also plans to buy beans and beer.\r\n<p> \r\nThis will be her third loan from Kiva partner GHAPE since she joined in 2007.  She has been successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main road), quality of food and reasonable prices.  She buys in bulk which minimizes costs. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n<p>\r\nPart of the profits generated will be used for the school fees of her children and another part will be used to buy a plot. Sylvia does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments. She plans to start repayment in the fourth month after taking the loan. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

is a 30 year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife and their three children.  For eight years, Khaled has been working as a tomato farmer.  He is seeking a loan from Kiva partner A. Majmoua in order to purchase tools for his work.

is a 31 year-old woman who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with her husband.  For two years, Zaynab has been selling clothes. She also sells women\u2019s accessories and toys for children. She is seeking a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for her shop including the collection for the new season. This is her second loan cycle and previously she paid on time. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan helped improve her sales by diversifying her merchandise. Her clients are people from her region.

is a widow with two children. She lives in a quarter far off the town of Bamenda, Cameroon. She plans to invest this loan in a township taxi. In particular, she will purchase an engine for the car, since she has already bought other parts of the taxi and the only part remaining to be purchased is the motor engine. With this taxi, she will help her community to transport their farm produce to the market. She will also help to transport her neighbours to their various farms. Accessibility to the farm and market will no longer be any problem in her locality.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Anna\u2019s tenth loan; she has been a GHAPE member since 1998. With the profit from this loan, Anna plans to construct a house. She also plans to take care of her family, ensuring that they eat well and buy their medications. Above all, she will help to educate her grandchildren to higher levels. She knows she will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the small repayment instalments.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":402769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase an engine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

is married with a three children. He had to find a way to support his family and that is how he ended up as a taxi driver. He owns a car and provides transportation services throughout Khujand, Tajikistan. The business is the only source of income for his family. Abduhalim works very hard, sometimes without days off or vacation, in order to bring in enough income. Abduhalim has been in this business for 3 years. His determination and strong will to succeed have helped him keep his business stable and sustainable and have promoted its expansion. Abduhalim would like to get a loan for $2600 USD in order to replace his car with the new one. With that way he will improve his business and earn more money by attracting more clients. We are confident that the modesty, diligence and responsibility that have helped Abduhalim develop his venture and gain a good reputation among other taxi drivers will help him promptly repay this loan and allow him to succeed in his business endeavors. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are looking forward to receiving higher amounts in future so that they can satisfy their clientele appropriately and be able to open up a sales point. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":402862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of various articles for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-10-09T21:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou Amadou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Kone","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9bou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028416,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873752,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763469,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T09:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152289,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991141,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T08:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-12T05:27:00Z","paid_date":"2010-04-17T08:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142935,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlos Z. is 21 years old, single, and lives with his grandfather.

His herd grew to 11 cows and his business expanded to include the sale of milk, Centrolac (a milk product), and quesillos (a tortilla filled with cheese and cooked.) \r\n\r\nEddy is going to use this loan to buy more milk. Although he has a rather large herd, the rainy season never lived up to its name, and, because of the lack of water, his cows have not been able to produce milk. Eddy says that it would be a dream to have his own mode of transportation as this would allow him to travel to buy milk. A lack of transportation is his greatest challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":403008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-10-10T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddy Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.02,"local_amount":640.4,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":659.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790811,"comment":null},{"amount":32.78,"local_amount":655.52,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":675.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681306,"comment":null},{"amount":30.14,"local_amount":602.74,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":621.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075834,"comment":null},{"amount":30.06,"local_amount":601.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":619.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911843,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":643.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947696,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":643.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675963,"comment":null},{"amount":33.41,"local_amount":668.29,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710338,"comment":null},{"amount":29.09,"local_amount":581.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":599.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045665,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-11T02:38:33Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142986,"name":"Maura","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maura B. de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el barrio Laureles Sur en la capital de Managua, se dedica a la venta de frijoles cocidos desde hace cinco a\u00f1os el cual vende por 5 y 10 c\u00f3rdobas, con cuatro hijos de 4, 6,12 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad  estudiantes, su esposo trabaja de dependiente en una farmacia.

The members are active entrepreneurs who wish to participate in activities to interact and unite more as a group.  The president sells cloths and cosmetics as a street vendor.  The rest of the women have been friends as neighbors and business colleagues for a long time.  They carry out different types of commercial activities and services like selling clothes, cosmetic products, meals in boarding houses, telephone cards, snacks, and hairdressing services.  They all work at home or as street vendors.  As far as competition goes, there are competitors in the neighborhood.  But, the members have their constant, loyal customers.  They generate enough business to survive.  In case it is not going very well in the neighborhood, they go to another place to sell their products or diversify their economic activity so that they can get their daily income and get more income.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to stock their stores, buy work materials, and buy wholesale supplies.  Those who sell cosmetics are taking advantage of offers to improve their earnings.  Their expectation is to have more income in order to become more economically independent.

San Antonia\" was formed in AA.HH. San Antonio \u2013 Chosica, a district that has a sunny climate for much of the year and is known as a beautiful tourist destination.  The ten members of this group are engaged in a variety of activities, they are all trying to move ahead and progress toward a better quality of life. Such is the case of Jenny Bendez\u00fa P., who at 36 years of age is a mother of three minor children.  She sells food in the \u201cMara\u00f1\u00f3n\u201d market in Chosica.  She began by helping her mother-in-law with the business, later she was left to run the business on her own.  Over the last four years the income from the business has helped her husband to pay for the education of their children; it has also paid for basic household expenses and has contributed to capital for the acquisition of a motortaxi that they currently rent out.  The loans that they will receive will be invested in their business with the ultimate objective of providing tranquility to their family.  \r\n\r\nTeresa Z. D. R. is 50 years old, and started a business four years ago renting a stand in a mall when it just opened.  At first she  used to sell clothes for babies, but after a year in which she did not have financial success she had to change and came to the decision to rent out costumes for children.  Starting out she had four gowns and two suits for children, and over time she gathered together a small amount of capital with the income from these rentals so that she could acquire more merchandise.

L. lives in the village of Dacu, Brgy. Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is a 59-year-old widow with eight adult children whose ages range from 18 to 37 years old. Some of her children have their own families and seven of them have already graduated from college. Only one child is still studying. \r\n\r\nCandelaria has single-handedly taken care of the parenting responsibilities for all her children and is content with what she has accomplished so far. Her goal now is to have her youngest child graduate and start his own life armed with a good education and the ability to earn his own livelihood and provide for his future family.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband died, she could not imagine how she could support her children by herself. With the help of her older children, they started to adjust to a single-parent family. In 2002, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could borrow additional capital that could help sustain her general store and provide a steady income for her family. As her general store business stabilized, Candelaria knew that she needed to diversify her business if she wanted to prevent her family from falling into poverty. She slowly set aside some of her profits to start a food-vending business. Because she was so busy taking care of the living, she also recovered from mourning her loss. As her ventures improved she started to look for more opportunities where she could earn money without too much effort, and this is why she invested in pig fattening, which became part of the chores of her younger kids.\r\n\r\nHer business ventures now earn a monthly income of 3,360 Philippine pesos and she is able to support the college education of her children and sustain the needs of her smaller household, now that most of the older children live away from home.\r\n\r\nCandelaria is a member in good standing. She has consistently paid off her loans, which is why she was able to borrow PHP 19,500 for her previous loan, her 13th with NWTF-Project Dungganon. She also paid it off on time without any delays in the weekly installments and now plans to borrow another PHP 19,500 so that she could sustain the stock level of her businesses. She is thankful that NWTF-PD entered her life and allowed her to survive the tragedy of the death of her husband, and continues to support her in achieving her dreams for her children: to have a life that has dignity and opportunities for the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":402541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She started with a general store and as business improved, she saw other opportunities where she could help her husband earn more for the support of their family. Now she makes pork barbecue and other snack foods which she cooks and sells in front of her general store to attract buyers from the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n<p>Now on her seventh cycle, Mrs. E. applied to borrow PHP 19,500 to use as additional capital for her general store.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. E. and her husband are striving to earn extra income and to save for their children's education.

The funds she is requesting will be used to purchase sacks of fertilizer, which will allow her to plant alfalfa (to feed her animals) and more vegetables. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":403163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-10T15:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-10T20:44:54Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143055,"name":"Ma.

Fe A. who lives in the village of Tabao Rizal, San Enrique, Negros Occidental, is 33 years old and married to Reynaldo A., Jr. who presently works as a furniture designer. The couple is blessed with five young children ranging in age from 4 to 16 years old. Ma. Fe dreams that when her five children are all grown up, she will have provided them with a good education that will prepare them to have a good livelihood that would enable them to live a good life.\r\n\r\nBecause her children are growing up, the household's expenses are also increasing because she needs to send them to school on top of the other basic necessities. This is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon: to get financial support in running her business. She started by selling Ready-to-Wear products which she sold just around her community. She even brought her products when she attended the Center meeting to sell to her center-mates. Her business activities earns her an average monthly income of PHP 7,000.\r\n\r\nBecause of her good performance at NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Fe is allowed to obtain a bigger loan. For her 14th loan she borrowed Php 29,500 as additional working capital for her business. The amount was repaid in weekly installments and was fully paid on time without any delays.\r\n\r\nFor her 15th loan Ma. Fe is borrowing Php 19,500 to purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital. Whatever income she earns will be used for the improvement and expansion of the business. She is borrowing a smaller amount this time because she is anticipating a slower business turnover because it is now the rainy season, an off-season for the sugar plantations which directly affects her sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":402620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-10T12:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She stayed unmarried up to now because she has been busy earning a living and supporting her parents. She doesn't really regret not getting married when she was much younger because she still has a family life. At present, she's helping one nephew in his college expenses. She hopes that when he graduates he will also be able to help elevate their family out of poverty permanently.\r\n\r\nEven though she does not have any dependents except for her parents, Evelyn still strives hard to improve her family's quality of life. In 2003, when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access new capital for her business, she invested it in a general store adjacent to her house. She used her subsequent loans to start selling ready-to-wear clothes in her community. Later she even began selling frozen products to a few regular clients. Sometimes she also sells vegetables and other seasonal products to earn extra income. Her current average monthly net income is PHP 2,500.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the near future she will be able to afford to buy a tricycle - a motorcycle with a sidecar so that she will be able to transport her products a lot faster.\r\n\r\nShe used her previous loan of PHP 19,500 as working capital and paid back the weekly installments diligently, and now that she's paid it in full, she is again applying to borrow PHP 22,500 to be used as additional working capital for her general store, RTW products, frozen food and vegetable vending. \r\nShe hopes to use the income to support her nephew's education, save up for her tricycle and continue supporting her parents.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is very grateful for the help that NWTF-Project Dungganon has extended to her so that she could achieve her dreams. Evelyn is now the Deputy Center Chief in her NWTF-PD center because her group mates and the NWTF team see her potential and skill in motivating and encouraging other members to follow polices and procedures of NWTF-Project Dungganon so that their center will have overall good performance.\r\n\t\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":402652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband used to work as a fisherman earlier until they decided to run a fishing business. They started the business with small fish cage with few fingerlings. Later, the number of fingerlings increased. Their business recently completed 8 years mainly because of their perseverance for improving their business.\r\n\r\nOne thing that Remedios wanted is capital to expand her business. So she joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) and used the loan for the improvement of her business. She plans to use her loan to buy fishnet, bamboo and accessories for the fishnet and also to pay the laborer.\r\n\r\nRemedios dreams of having a successful business someday, so that her family will be secured for a better future.

They are blessed with two children: Mark Edison, 9, is in grade 4 in primary level, and Mark Joseph, 5, is in the nursery level. According to Ma. Magdalena, the expenses for the schooling of their two children is not much right now. However, she wants to save early for their future needs in school. Hence she is pursuing her sewing business, which is their main source of income. She has been running this business for two years with help from her husband, who is also a sewer. With both of them working, they hope to increase their income.\r\n\r\nWhen she joined the Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she used the loan as additional capital for her business; now she will do the same. She plans to use the loan to buy one sewing machine, which is a five threads machine. She really needs this machine for her sewing business. She thinks this machine coupled with their perseverance will make their business more productive.\r\n\r\nMa.

is married with four children. Three of them are under 15 years of age.

She has encountered some challenges in life such as the death of her sister, being a school dropout, and ill health. These problems made life difficult for her until, in 2004, she saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.\r\n\r\nWith her loan, Martha plans to buy cocoa, coffee and stalk and will sell whenever they are scarce so that she can make more profit. Martha is convinced the business will succeed because she has a ready market for her product.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from her loan, Martha plans to pay school fees for her children and clothe them, feed them, and give them sound medical attention whenever they are sick.\r\n\r\nMartha plans to obtain her loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is comfortable and convenient. And also because GHAPE is trustworthy and proper follow up is done to ensure the loan is properly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

They care for two children, one 13 years old and the other 14, who work for a few hours in the morning and then go to school.

They live in a concrete house, which was raised with a lot of effort, and she is proud to say that is their own.  She is a hard-working woman who has sold gas from her home for four years. She began the business with her husband when she realized no one in her neighborhood supplied gas to the various families there.\r\n\r\nShe began with only three tanks of gas and little by little has bought more.  Merly also washes clothes in the morning to gain secondary income. As if it were not enough, at dusk she goes to the pier close to her house to sell meat-filled potatoes, a typical Peruvian food.\r\n\r\nAccording to Merly, selling gas is profitable since there are no other businesses competing against her and she knows her neighbors to whom she sometimes occassionally loans.\r\n\r\nSince she's redoing part of her house, she is thinking about putting in a small hardware store after realizing that there is none to cover the needs of her neighborhood. She already has a glass case that she is saving to use when she realizes her dream.\r\n\r\nMerly always looks towards the future and says, \"I want to put up a big sign that you can see from far away and sell various materials in my hardware store that they need around here.\"\r\n\r\nShe has already had three loans with MFP and has always been punctual with payments.  She likes to work with her community bank since it is made up of responsible women she has known for a long time.

She works in agriculture and really likes working with each of her crops, with the leadership of her husband. This season they have planted a large area with potatoes and beans. The potatoes are more profitable, since they can sell them as food and as seed tubers from the same harvest. In the case of food potatoes, she sends them directly to the wholesale market in the city, the most important one in the region. On average, it takes less than half an hour to finish selling a truckload of potatoes. As for the potatoes for seed tuber, she keeps them in storage until buyers from the coast come to her fields. They buy the potatoes by the kilo, and at a good price. This is why Gladys wants to buy more fields, so she can avoid having to pay to rent them. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is part of a communal bank and she gets on well with the other members because they have all been very welcoming toward her, even though she joined after the rest. She plans to use the money she is requesting to buy chemical fertilizers for her next potato crop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":403783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T00:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2019.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T11:50:42Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":143188,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una madre soltera de 37 a\u00f1os, tiene 2 hijos peque\u00f1os y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su madre.

Since 2000, she has been using beads and other materials to make flower designs on women\u2019s clothes to earn a living and typically makes US$4 each day. A decorated dress is a kind of Khmer traditional dress and people wear it during Water Festival, P\u2019chum Ben or Khmer New Year.\r\n\r\nIt takes around 7-10 days to complete each dress and so it is expensive. Most of the people prefer hand-made designs rather than machine-made.

Every morning, Mary Ann\u2019s husband used to go fishing, while Mary Ann was left at home attending to the needs of their children and making herself busy doing household chores. When their children were still young, Mary Ann was content to only perform this role. However, now that all of their children are studying, she realizes that she has to exercise an economic role to augment the income of her husband. Therefore, in 2008 she joined ASHI and requested a loan which she used for starting up her own business. She bought cattle to fatten. After two loans, she realized that her profit from cattle fattening is double the capital, once it is sold after six months. Resources in their surroundings, especially during this season of rain, can provide enough food for the cattle she is raising. Now, she is requesting a much larger loan to buy more cattle for raising and to be able to increase her profit as well. In her business lies her capacity to send all of her children to college to better their future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":403927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for
