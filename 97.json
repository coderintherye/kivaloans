Since he began this business, he has managed to gain an important share of the market as he always keeps a warm welcome for his customers. Most products are available in his store. To this end, Mr. A. is making a first-time request for a loan in order to get supplies such as: 5 cases of milk, 50 cases of olive oil soap, and pasta.  Besides these provisions, he also wants to buy phone cards as he has two pay-phones. \r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 le 12 novembre 1967 \u00e0 Baguida dans la pr\u00e9fecture du Golfe, Monsieur A.

He is honest, hard working, and is a social person. He began a business to earn an extra income and to have an activity that would make him feel useful. He is retired and receives a small pension from the Mexican Postal Service.  Since his the amount he receives from his pension is quite a small amount, he decided to start his own business. He began his business in January 2004, after his wife went on a trip to San Antonio, Texas, to see their daughter. His wife mentioned the idea of opening a business to their daughter and she decided to help them. Their daughter helped them get big packages of used clothing from the United States for them to sell to their friends and neighbors in Mexico. It has been a very good business for them. Now his wife travels every three months to the United States to get the clothing, or if they need clothes earlier, their daughter sends them the clothing. <p>Now they need a loan of $300, which they will payoff in three months. They will use the money to buy more used clothing and to have a better variety of clothing, which will give them the opportunity to increase their income. With your support they will be able to progress more with their business. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Johnny of San Roque High School, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCarlos es una hombre muy honesto, trabajador y muy sociable.

He has been in this business for 15 years.  Almost the entire population of the rural area is in this business.  Sirojidin would like to get a loan and increase the headcount of his livestock.

He has been in this business for six years, and it brings him a modest income that allows him to feed his family.  However, in order to increase his income, Mirzonazir needs a loan to buy a few more calves.

This she believes will help her raise money to build a container shop to ease the drudgery of hawking to strangers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":160384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To increase the stock of underwear, bed spreads, napkins, diapers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Offinsu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2008-05-15T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-30T00:16:56Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29,"local_amount":25.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":28.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253217,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":25.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":28.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281668,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":25.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":28.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311517,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":25.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342937,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":22.22,"processed_date":"2008-10-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-31T07:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":24.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":374498,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":27.74,"local_amount":24.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":27.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5349210,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":27.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9971800,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":27.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10234939,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-05-16T00:16:56Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:25:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":48448,"name":"Priscila Estefany","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Priscila Estefany is a young entrepreneur who started a small business selling clothes just a couple of months ago.

She is aged 34 years and married with 3 children. All of them are in school. She is presently paying her sixth loan and has been in this group since she joined MCDT. The community she lives in is semi-urban, within a slum area.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has been selling local brew for the last 7 years. Her success has been attributed to her two brothers who she has always sent to the villages to look for the liquor or to brew it themselves. Unfortunately, these two died recently in a motor accident in which 4,000 liters of brew was lost. She has been left with the responsibility of looking after the families of her late brothers.\r\n<p>\r\nThe main challenges she is facing now are the high prices if she is to buy it from other people, and she feels there may be a compromise on the quality. All these are bound to have an adverse effect on her income. She also used to sell at wholesale and employ someone to sell at retail.

He learned this business from a young age and now has a lot of experience. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is very important to point out that his business requires a lot of effort which is why he dedicates himself to growing basic grains such as corn and beans.  This requires a lot of exposure to the sun as well as moving the product long distances.  The reason why he is requesting a loan from Ceprodel is to invest in technological assistance in cultivation.  With this loan he will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of his products after the harvest. <p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nLa actividad econ\u00f3mica del caballero Trinidad A. es la agricultura dedic\u00e1ndose a esta labor desde hace varios a\u00f1os habiendo aprendido a desempe\u00f1arse en el campo desde muy jovencito lo que hasta hoy ha ocasionado de que tenga basta experiencia con esta labor.\r\n<p>\r\nEs de suma importancia destacar que su negocio requiere de mucho esfuerzo por lo que se dedica fuertemente al cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos como ma\u00edz y frijoles y esto requiere de mucha exposici\u00f3n al sol y traslado del producto desde largas distancias.
