He began his business in 2005 with only one horse and one cart. Since then, he has managed to add nine more horses and ten more employees to his company. This success has meant that not only has Boldbaatar\u2019s family\u2019s financial situation been improved by his business, but nine other family\u2019s financial situations have been improved as well.\r\n\r\nBoldbaatar\u2019s personal goal for the near future is to be able to pay for his daughter\u2019s university tuition fees and keep his family comfortable and well fed. He is requesting a 2,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase five more horses and one more cart in order to expand his delivery area even further and to keep growing his customer

She is 43 years old, married, and the mother of two.  Her children are 15 and 10 years old and both in school.  She studied through sixth grade in the old school system and stopped when she became pregnant.  She takes care of her two children only.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Isaura's husband, who works for the national ministry of defense, was transferred and he, Isaura, and their children left the city of Maputo for Boane.  They live in her husband's barracks in the military area of the city.  <P>\r\n\r\nIsaura is a mobile shrimp vendor.  She learned how to conduct this business with friends six years ago.  She does not have any employees and works ten-hour days.  Now she can buy 10,000 MT (<em>meticais<\/em>)'s worth of shrimp, which after she sells it, earns her a profit of approximately 5,000 MT.  This amount, plus the amount her husband earns, supports the family, and she is able to put some money in a savings account.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 10,000 MT Isaura intends to invest in diversification of her products by purchasing squid and crab.  Her largest challenge\/goal is one day to buy a bigger freezer than her current one, so she can preserve her products better.  Her dream is to construct a small home one day.<P>\r\n\r\nIsaura learned about Hluvuku (Kiva's Field Partner) through its employees.  This is her second loan with the institution.  She previously received a loan of 5,000 MT, which she used to invest in her business and which she repaid successfully.  She has committed to continuing to pay properly and be able to access future loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

She is 31, divorced and has three children aged 8, 11 and 13, all of them students. She lives in her own house with her children plus a nephew who's an orphan. \r\n\r\nShe dropped school in 2001 to start her clothing business and help with the household expenses. She and her husband separated after the last kid was born and she continued to sell clothes in order to support her family. She imports the clothes from South Africa and sells them in the streets of Maputo. Her best selling product are woman's blouses. \r\n\r\nIsaura can make up to 5.000,00MT (U$180) in a month with her business, an she uses the money to support the family and to buy more inventory to sell in the streets of Maputo. She has faced some hard times with clients that order in advance and won't pay her back, as well as with custom issues bringing the clothes to Mozambique, but she remains positive and looking into expanding her business.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for $500 in order to buy more clothes to sell. She dreams to have her own store and to be able to better feed her kids. She also hopes to finish building her house and is planning on getting more loans in the future after she's done paying for this one.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

His favorite products are flip flops.  He uses 2,500 meticais to buy one bag of 24 dozen, and he sells them for 75 meticais a pair.   He buys slippers for 2,500 meticais for a box of 50 pairs and sells then for 60 meticais a pair.  He makes daily sales of 2,500 meticais and he still manages to save 350 meticais a day in the Barclays bank.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Hluvuku, and it is for 11,000 meticais.

He found out about this institution through friends in the market where he sells.

they obtained in different purposes. Mrs. Thavy M. is a village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns 0,6-hectar to cultivate rice for a living. In this farming, she now faces a small problem because she does not have enough money to buy more fertilizers to support the field to make her crop more productive. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers for her purpose. Her husband, Mr. Arn Seourn, also helps her in the farming. Mrs. Thavy M. is 27 years old and the mother of a child who is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of four years old. A man who is presented in the photo is a group guarantee; he also shown in the picture with the village bank loan.\n\nTwo members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows tH. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":401374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

N. lives in the village of Pasil, Brgy. Tagda, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 45 years old, married to Felomino N. who helps in running their businesses, and is blessed to have four young adult children. The youngest is 19 years old and the oldest is 26, and all of them help in the business for which Florigen pays them compensation. \r\n\r\nBecause of her desire to help her husband support their family, Florigen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access capital that no one would have loaned to her without any collateral. When she received her first loan, she invested it by starting a mobile fish business. She would go from town to town selling fish during the town's market day, and she reinvested most of her income back into the business to gradually increase her stock volume. She used some of the income to send her children to school, but when they graduated from High School, they did not want to go to college and instead started helping with the business. With more helpers in her business, she expanded her operations to include selling dried fish, buying stocks from other suppliers. If any of her fresh fish stock was not sold, she sun dried them also so they wouldn't spoil, and would still earn a profit. \r\n\r\nBecause of her good customer service, she was able to develop a good relationship with a regular customer who orders dried fish in bulk from her, and she now regularly sends a box of dried fish to Manila twice a week. Aside from her fresh and dried fish business, she also sells different varieties of bananas, and also has a pig fattening venture. From these different business activities, she earns PHP 10,000 a month net income and it helps pay for the household expenses, with some left over for reinvestment in the business and savings.  \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 29,000 was used as working capital for her businesses. She was able to pay her loan on time without any delays. This contributed to her good credit performance as a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, and she was able to access a bigger loan for her next cycle. Now she is borrowing for her 16th cycle PHP 35,000 to add to her capital in the mobile fish store and pig fattening business, so that she can provide a better future of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":401220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional capital for her fish business and pig fattening business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Hinigaran, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T21:50:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florigen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2692.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":240,"local_amount":11200,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11215.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004183,"comment":null},{"amount":221.74,"local_amount":10348,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10362.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848954,"comment":null},{"amount":230.57,"local_amount":10760,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10774.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739622,"comment":null},{"amount":57.69,"local_amount":2692,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2695.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-08T20:19:17Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142393,"name":"Jinja Misindye A Nambi Sarah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

They have 3 children namely: John Mark at the age of 18 working as a welder, Merlendeth 16 years old and currently studying as first year college and Arisa Mae now grade 2 in the age of 7 years old. Though her husband work hard for them, the daily income that she get is not enough for their big expenses, it only support their daily needs in the house, but it can\u2019t support the other expenses of the family like the education of her two other children, because now a days it cost much to studied in college. So Maricel thinks of another business that can contributes to their daily income aside from the revenue of her husband and her sewing business, it comes out the buy and sell of banana. She decided to start up this business because in their place banana is common and not cost much.\n\nThe loan that she received from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) will be use for buying different kinds of banana for selling. Because more banana to sell more income for their family. They do this business for one year now and she is right that this business will grow if you are interested in doing it.\n\nMaricel really hopes that through all her business they will reach the things

Xilitla is a tourist place, which is visited by many foreigners.  It has natural places that are like paradise.  Its climate is warm and humid.\r\n\r\nThe group is comprised of four people; Martha Patricia H. C., Maria Olivia M. Zu\u00f1iga, and Laura H. C..\r\n\r\nFor over three years these people have been selling by catalog.  This activity has helped them get their families ahead and helped their husbands with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nVirginia M. Zu\u00f1iga has been making \u201czacahuil\u201d (a large tamale) for ten years.  She does this every Sunday, and she sells by the side of the road.  She is 51, and she has five children.  Two of the children are dependent upon her.  This activity has helped her give her children an education.  It also helps with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan for $2,000 to buy raw materials like \u201cpapatla\u201d leaves, which are similar to banana leaves.  She will also buy Chinese chili or \u201ccascabel\u201d, shortening, pork, and chicken for her customers\u2019 preferences.  She uses a clay stove, which her husband made in her own house.  It heats for three hours before she puts the zachuil in the oven.  She leaves them in for eight to nine hours so that they are ready for Sunday.  She does all of this work one day ahead of time.

A. is 41 years old and married to Renato A., who is a 46 year-old tinsmith. They have seven children ranging in age from 6 to 18 years old, who are all going to school. The family lives in the village of Brgy. Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Lemilda and her husband dream of sending their children to school and when they finish their studies, be gainfully employed in a stable job in the future. That\u2019s why the couple strive so hard to achieve their dreams for their children.\r\n\r\nBefore she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she and her husband already owned a tin shop because her husband was a skilled tinsmith. They made knives, tongs, different kitchen tools and farm equipment. Lemilda assisted her husband in producing some of the products, but she did most of the selling and managed the business. When demand for their products reached a critical point where they needed capital infusion so they could take it to the next level, Lemilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so she could borrow the capital to buy more materials to make more products to sell. With the additional capital, their income also increased and because she paid all of the installments on time and paid off the loans within its loan term, Lemilda was able to maintain a good credit record, and still earn an average net income of PHP 15,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she and her husband started the business 22 years ago, she has seen a big improvement to it, especially after she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. To continue the momentum of her business, she borrowed PHP 19,500 on her previous loan to use as revolving working capital for her tin shop. Now she is borrowing the same amount again so that she will have enough working capital to continue buying the necessary materials for the production of the tools and farm equipment that they make and sell to earn their living.\r\n\r\nLimilda and her husband Renato are shown in the picture in their tin shop.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Pinotepa Nacional Oaxaca.  It is comprised of 14 members.  They have been working for one year (three cycles) with loans that Fundacion Realidad offers.  All of the members make and sell products like groceries, tamales, soft drink, ice cream, tortilla chips, clothes, perfume, shoes by catalog, notions, lingerie, handmade corn tortillas, tacos, bulk corn, and fresh fish.  Due to the geographic region they are located in, these types of products are in good demand in the area.  As a consequence, their income is very good and acceptable, according to Alicia D. T..  She is a 71 year old member who joined with her daughter, Rosario.  Currently she is not in the group because she moved.  They were the ones that founded the group by inviting neighbors to join.\r\n\r\nAlicia comments that the loan received from the institution has really helped all of the members.  It gives them a means to work and contribute income to their families.  It really helps now that the country\u2019s economy is in crisis, and their husbands incomes do not cover the expenses of the children going to school. \r\n\r\nThey will use the loan they are asking for to make and buy products to sell like corn, wood, plastic bags, fresh meat, dried chilies to prepare mole, groceries, soft drinks, shipping charges for those who buy articles by catalog, rent for boats, and gasoline for those who sell fresh fish.\r\n\r\nThey hope that the Realidad Foundation will continue to offer financial services. They are dependent upon them to keep working and to have a business in the future that generates income and a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Even at 62 years old, she is still very strong and very capable of running her business and continues helping her children. She is married to Ellerino M., who is 63 years old and also still earns a salary by working as a timekeeper at a sugarcane plantation, even as he receives a pension from social security because he is officially retired. The couple is blessed with four children, all of whom have their own families, but they still help their children support their young families. Esperanza and Ellerino live in the village of Brgy. Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nEsperanza started her business when she saw how hard her husband was working just to earn enough to provide for his family's basic necessities -- food, clothing and shelter -- much less the education of their four children. As a good wife, she believed that it was her duty and her right to earn a living to help ease the burden of supporting the family from her husband's shoulders. This is why she used the small savings that she had set aside from her husband's salary to start a small general store, rolling her capital over to buy new inventory periodically. But as her operations continued, she saw that without an infusion of capital, she would not be able to optimize her income potential. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992, so that she could have continual access to the much needed working capital that her business needed to expand.\r\n\r\nIn the 31 years that she's had her general store, Esperanza is happy to be earning her own income and is able to stay independent because of this source of income, even though she is now a senior citizen. Her business now earns her PHP 4,000 per month on average from the operations of her general store.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 19,500 to buy additional items\/goods for her general store. Her loan was fully paid within term and each weekly repayment was made on time without any delays. For her 18th cycle, she is borrowing only PHP 15,000 because this amount is what she needs for her general store at this time. Esperanza continues to strive in her business because she wants to stay independent even as a senior citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":401345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

as she approaches senior citizenship, Emma S., a 57-year-old widow is still determined to stay independent and earn her own income. She does not want to rely on her children to support her. Emma lives in the village of Brgy Tagda, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She has been a widow for 19 years and has raised her six children well.  Now that they are all adults, have their own families, and are gainfully employed, Emma wants to save for her future support so she will not be a burden to her children in her old age.\n\nWhen she was widowed, the demands of her business and the need to sustain a young family impelled Emma to slowly recover from the grief of losing her husband at such a young age. She continued running her business until the increasing financial needs of the family prompted her to look for an external source of capital. In 2004, Emma became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and was able to sustainably increase her income and meet the needs of her household. \n\nAlong with a general store, Emma later invested in a fish vending business in her community, where regular customers come to buy fish. Her general store and fish vending business have a combined average income of PHP 6,000 per month, which is enough to cover her household expenses with some left over for savings so she can stay independent in her old age. \n\nEmma borrowed PHP 13,000 on a previous loan, and was able to repay it on an installment basis in full and on time without any delays. Since it is the rainy season now, Emma expects sales to be slower than it was earlier this year, so she is requesting to loan the smaller amount of PHP 11,000  right now which she foresees as sufficient additional capital she needs to continue expanding her general store without sacrificing her profitability because of the anticipated slower inventory turnover.\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few women but thousands of them. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a meager $1 a day, to creating realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":401237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional capital for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Hinigaran, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-09T01:19:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004186,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1760,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848957,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1760,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739625,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2200,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129045,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1760,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965843,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1320,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1401.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997757,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-09T03:40:47Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142416,"name":"Charles' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles S. is 27 years old and the leader of a lending group in Mukono.

people who do not have property or money to leave their children always say that the one legacy they can leave them is an education. Education is a treasure that once possessed, cannot be stolen or given away, and when used wisely, can open a whole new world for just about anyone whether they started from poverty or wealth. Gloria P. who lives in the village of Brgy. Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental also believes that education is the one thing she can give her children to prepare them to rise above their situation and improve their lives.\r\n\r\n<p>Gloria is 50 years old and married to Fernando P. who presently owns and manages a fishing business. They have three children, two of whom are already gainfully employed, and a younger daughter who\u2019s in her fourth year of High School. It is Gloria's dream to send her daughter to college to earn a degree, get a stable job, and have a good life.\r\n\r\n<p>Fishing is the main source of income for the family because of their proximity to the sea. At first, Gloria relied wholly on her husband's income as a fisherman. But maintaining a fishing business requires a capital infusion from time to time, especially to cover repairs and maintenance of the nets and boat. This is the reason why Gloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995\u2014to access new capital so that her family could sustain their fishing business. \r\n\r\n<p>With consecutive loans from NWTF-Project Dunggano, that Gloria borrowed and repayed, their income increased and Gloria saw her husband's fishing business become stable and sustainable. This prompted her in 2004 to take out a loan to start a general store so she could supplement her husband's income and help with the family's expenses. Her subsequent loans were alternately used to increase the working capital of her general store and the family\u2019s fishing business, and have helped earn her an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Gloria\u2019s focus is in the expansion of her general store. Her 9th cycle loan of PHP 19,500 was used to add to her working capital so she could have more inventory to sell. For her 10th cycle loan, she is again requestion PHP 19,500 to continue expansion of her store. She intends to use the income to supplement her husband's earnings to help support the family and set aside something for her daughter's college education.\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:_In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few women but thousands of them. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a meager $1 a day, to creating realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":401394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional capital for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Escalante, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-08T20:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102,"local_amount":4680,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4766.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004187,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848958,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3177.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739626,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3972.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129046,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965844,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":1560,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1588.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997758,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-16T11:44:53Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142423,"name":"Aida Patricia","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Aida Patricia Hern\u00e1ndez M\u00e9ndez tiene 24 a\u00f1os.

He purchases the piglets, raises them, and then prepares the meat to sell to his community. He oversees the entire process, from start to finish. This way, Angel can guarantee the quality of the meat he is selling to his customers. Also, if a customer wants another type of meat, Angel will find the best cuts possible and deliver them. \n\nWith the profits from his business, Angel hopes to buy a small van he can use to get around the country. He would be able to transport the animals much more easily, and expand his customer base. He also has two children who are in university in different cities, and with a van he would be able to see them more frequently.

is impossible if you believe that you can have everything you want, if you just put your faith and trust in God above all things. This is what Marlyn S. truly believes. She is a 44 year-old widow with 3 children who lives in the village of Brgy. Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Two of her daughters, who are 22 and 21 years old, have already graduated and earned their Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education, and the older one has already passed the Teacher's Board. The youngest, who is 16, just graduated from high school and is now in her first year of college.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was widowed, she was devastated because it was unexpected and she was not prepared for such an occurrence. She had to find a means of support for her young daughters. While looking around for business opportunities, she realized that she could earn a living selling religious articles to the devotees who visited the old church in her village. The village of Vito, which is in the older part of Sagay City, is visited by both tourists and devotees, especially on Fridays because of its famous shrine to St. Vincent Ferrer.\r\n<p>\r\nMarlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 so that she could get start-up capital for her business - selling religious articles and accessories to people who come to the church. Her income has been able to support her family over the years as well as pay for all the weekly installments on time. Since she started her business, she has seen the advancement of it with each succeeding and larger loan she received from NWTF-PD, and this has in turn improved her family's quality of life. She was able to earn an average monthly income of Php 8,000 which allowed her to send her children to college. She still continues to save part of her income for the education of her youngest daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of Php 19,000 was used for additional working capital for her retailing of religious items\/articles. This loan was fully paid on time without any delays. And in her 9th cycle loan, she intends to borrow Php 19,500 as additional capital for her business, which will be a big help to her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":401290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious

The economic pursuit in which she is engaged is the sale of Nicaraguan tamales. She is starting in this field being an abandoned wife who very courageously decided to confront her situation and invested some savings that she had in the purchase of hogs. In this way she was able to establish her own clientele. At first it was somewhat difficult because her children were small and she didn\u2019t have regular clients. For this reason she had to walk long distances to sell her Nicaraguan tamales. She never opted to leave her children because she is a careful and responsible mother, and thanks to God she has been able to face everything that life has brought her way. She now feels very pleased with her courage and desire to struggle for life. She wants a loan in order to invest in her working capital which is necessary for raw materials.

is married. He is a businessman from Ordzhonikidze. He runs a small business manufacturing and selling windows and doors. Anatolyi owns a store in his hometown. He is new to this type of business as he started it only two years ago. Currently, he has about 40,000 Grivnyas in turnover capital. His net profit amounts to 4,800 each month. \r\n\r\nAnatolyi is seeking a 12,000 Grivnya loan to increase his working capital and purchase additional raw materials for his business.

Here she makes her home with her husband and three children in a simple structure of wooden walls and a tin roof. \n\nCarmen has been a successful associate of Esperanza for two loan cycles now and she has repaid without problems. She says that working with Esperanza has helped improve her quality of life and she is excited to take her third loan. With this loan she will continue to invest in both of her businesses. For her clothing business she will buy blouses and women's pants to sell, and for her food stand she will purchase flour, meat and cooking oil. She has over two years experience and she expects her businesses, which are the main source of income for her family, to continue to improve her living situation.

She hopes to open her own store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":401735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Operating capital to purchase more clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T22:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maribelt","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.64,"local_amount":352.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":361.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790795,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":347.17,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":355.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681290,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":358.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075820,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":358.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911828,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":358.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947680,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":350,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":358.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675947,"comment":null},{"amount":19.31,"local_amount":386.13,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":395.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710323,"comment":null},{"amount":17.81,"local_amount":356.24,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":365.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045654,"comment":null},{"amount":17.71,"local_amount":354.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159760896,"comment":null},{"amount":15.17,"local_amount":303.4,"processed_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":310.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847921,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-09T03:20:04Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":142469,"name":"Victor Enrique","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victor Enrique R. has been selling chicken and sausage in his meat shop, \u201cLa Chelita\u201d, for 20 years.

Ana has grown plantains since she was a small child, but since she started her family she has begun to cultivate coffee that she sells to a local producers\u2019 association.  Although the type of coffee she cultivates doesn\u2019t get a good price, it\u2019s profitable because it produces every four months.  Once the harvest has begun, she picks it and  takes her load to her buyer every two weeks.  Ana likes planting this type of coffee since it doesn\u2019t require a lot of work since she doesn\u2019t lose much time, or waste money on traveling to sell her product in a market.   When she does have free time, she works with her husband as a day laborer on neighboring plots of land.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.

 A. is a 47-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiusu.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  To make a living, Ana  owns and operates a business venture in the arts sector operating a handicraft business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling wood handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Ana  has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nAna  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ana successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD, which she used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  Ana  is now requesting a new loan of 2950 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  The loan will be the fifth loan Ana has taken out from SPBD.  Ana  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is a 37-year-old woman living in the town of Sinamoga.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Toafa owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Toafa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Toafa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Toafa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Toafa is now requesting a new loan of 2500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Toafa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":401764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":400743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

P. is from the village of Malibangcao Clarin Misamis Occidental. She is 32 years old and married with 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Daisy owns and operates a specialized maize retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling corn in the local community. Daisy has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Daisy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Daisy from GDMPC and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her youngest child is an 8-month-old infant who stays at home. Bolortuya owns and operates a local public bath house. These bath houses are important for local people, as many of them do not have running water with which to bathe. She began her business in 2007 and she earns between 150,000 and 200,000 tugrugs per month. While her business is doing well, it can be expensive to maintain a public bath house. Bolortuya replaced one third of her showers last year, and these repairs make it hard to expand or significantly improve her business.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarahan is the leader of this group. She is 46 years old and has raised four children, two daughters and two sons. Her eldest daughter, age 23, works as a nurse in the city hospital. The others are college students. It is quite burdensome to pay for all of the children\u2019s education. However, Sarahan believes in the importance of education and sees it as a valuable investment in future prosperity, so she and her husband are ready to work day and night to give their children a chance to become educated. \r\n<p>\r\nEight years ago, Sarahan\u2019s sister-in-law suggested selling vegetables. Sarahan decided to give it a try. She had enough courage to invest $700 in vegetables to sell. Currently, Sarahan provides for the whole family by selling vegetables and earns $605 which is just ninety-five dollars less than her initial investment. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband helps her bring the vegetables from the market. He also brings vegetables for other people who trade in vegetables. Selling vegetables has allowed them not only to live quite a decent life, but also to save enough money to buy a house. Now Sarahan and her husband need a loan to purchase fruits, and from the gains they are going to pay tuition fees for their children. In the near future they want to open their own container for selling vegetables.\r\n\r\nSarahan\u2019s partners are: \r\nAinagul, 49, who has three children. Her two sons work and her smallest daughter is a school student. Her husband is retired, but works part time at a hospital. Ainagul trades in women\u2019s clothes and shoes. She needs a loan to purchase goods.\r\n\r\nGulira, 35, is the mother of three children. Her husband is a builder. Gulira is engaged in selling shoes. She used to work as a school teacher until a friend of hers suggested selling socks. That was the start. Gulira needs a loan to purchase goods.\r\n\r\nSveta, 44, is a widow. She has four children. Only her eldest son works and lives in the capitol. The others go to college. Sveta trades in clothes.

Now she works as the head of the local post office. \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Rita keeps some cows and manages to sell twenty to twenty-five liters of milk a day. She discovered her spirit of enterprise back when her parents-in-law gave her a cow and five sheep as a wedding gift. It would have been quite natural to just gradually butcher the sheep for a meat supply and even to sell the cow, as it was some thirty years ago when she was young. However, she kept these animals, and by combining her earnings with her husband\u2019s, they have been able to buy a lorry and furniture. Now, just from selling milk, she earns about $70 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nRita has decided to apply for this loan because she wants to purchase seven sheep for breeding. Her ultimate goal is to increase the total livestock population, so that when her two sons marry, she will be able to help them build homes for themselves. \r\n\r\nRita\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nAkak, 33, has two children.

Dinara has diverse occupations: she teaches the Kyrgyz language at school, keeps a garden, and sells ten liters of milk a day. She needs a loan to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nVenera, 44, is divorced.

T. is from the city of Ba\u00f1aderos Ozamiz City. She is 31 years old. Ritchel is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Ritchel owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a \"sari-sari\" retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ritchel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Ritchel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ritchel is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Ritchel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband, Mr. Kung Sarin, is a farmer who owns a plot of land on which he grows rice. He has a problem because he does not have enough money to bU. rice seed and fertilizer to support her rice field. Thus, Mrs. Savoeurn P. has decided to request for a loan for this purpose. She is 38 years old and the mother of three children who are enrolled in the local school\r\n. \r\nFive members of this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. The members with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term. \r\n\r\nEnd-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. The EoT loan allows the client to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

The youngest one is too young to work or study. \r\n\r\nThirteen members of this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. The members with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term. \r\n\r\nEnd-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. The EoT loan allows the client to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

agriculture business is one that requires much effort, for the simple reason that it requires sun exposure, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. Abdukayum, has dedicated himself for already twelve years to cattle raising, which supports his humble family which so relies on him.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Abdukayum has turned to IMON International for a loan of 1000 USD to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his dearest children and wife who he loves greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

first and foremost to his family and business, Jahongir works hard at ranching. He has his own herd of cattle which he works day after day to earn a living to support his dear wife and little child.  As every business requires investment, Jahongir needs to add some young bulls, that he hopes to raise and sell. He turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to buy the cattle and help improve his standard of living.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bahrom is 34 years old. He is married and has three children. Bahrom owns a computer club where people can use computer, play video games and work on computers. He has also billiard table at his club. He rents a small office on the ground floor of a housing complex. He has been in this business for the past 5 years. When Bahrom receives credit, he plans to restore several computer systems that are currently out of order and with the part of them wants to buy additional computers.  This will provide Bahrom with an opportunity to increase the number of working computers in his club. This credit will help people who do not have home access to a computer to come and work at the club. Some can improve their computer skills and others can make new friends through video games and gain necessary educational information from different sites. The loan will greatly improve Bahrom\u2019s income and his family's living standards. \n   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. The EoT loan allows the client to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Khurshed is 28 years old, is married, and has a little child. For Khurshed the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting the potatoes that he will sell, because the price will depend on the size of the potato. Sorted, the potato is more profitable, although the potatoes he sells are not in great shape. Agriculture is full of satisfaction for him and his family, even more when they sell for a good price at the market; that is the motivation to continue planting. This is the second loan that Khurshed has with IMON International, making his payments on time. And he is very grateful to those who support him, because they allow him to provide well-being to his family. With the money requested, he will buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his farm.     \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He began his business in 2004 and after several years of operation, he has managed to establish himself in the business community. Aidos delivers meat to three local cafes for use in their food preparation. He also has individual customers who buy his meat on a regular basis. In order to expand his business in the past, he has previously received four loans from local banks and has always been reliable in paying these loans back. Because of his business success, he has managed to build a one room house for his family, though he would like to add on to this house in the future as his son gets older.

Asilbek is 33 years old and lives with her mother, husband and two children in Bayan-Ulgii province in western Mongolia. She and her family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, and her two young sons both attend kindergarten. Asilbek manages a pharmacy with the help of her husband in her town. She is a doctor therefore sells a variety of medicines, and treats people in their shop. Due to it's location in a high traffic area near the local market, the pharmacy attracts many customers. Asilbek started her current business in 2005 after previously managing a medicine trading center in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. She then moved to Bayan-Ulgii and started a medicine transportation service between Russia and her province.

Rosalia will use the loan to pay for a brand new bathroom that has been built behind her home.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rosalia has a frituria (fried food stand) on the main street near her home. Here, she makes johnnycakes and other goodies for her neighbors and those working in or around the businesses on the street. She also sells coffee and tea to those on their way to and from work. Rosalia\u2019s frituria is very popular, and the locals are always quick to grab a treat from her.\r\n\r\nRosalia lives in a neighborhood without many utilities. Living in a small town in the Dominican Republic can mean frequent power outages (if you have power to begin with), no plumbing, and insufficient shelter from the elements. Having a new bathroom has made her home more sanitary both for herself and for the preparation of food for the morning rush at her frituria. Having a bathroom means she has one less thing to worry about in her day to day activities. This is Rosalia\u2019s seventh loan in five years with Esperanza, and her first housing development loan.

is a 50-year-old mother of three children, ages 15, 17, and 20.  She currently lives with her common-law husband, and all three of her children are currently studying at university. For the past 15 years, Lidia has been tending to the land she inherited from her parents in an area of Cochabamba Department called Albra Rancho. Lidia is a very hard worker and has been through many tough times. A short while ago, her husband became psychologically ill and she has had to support her family on her own for over two years. She continues to work hard to make sure that her children do not miss out on any opportunities; Lidia wakes up at 4:30am to bring her livestock food and to begin milking them.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Lidia plans on purchasing soy husks for feeding her dairy cows. She believes this will help them increase her milk production, and in turn increase her earnings. Her dream is that her children all become professionals and have families of their own."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":402179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"The

Her oldest son, Jimmy is just 19 years old and has settled down with his own family, but the rest of Gilda's children are still going to school. Jimmy helps his mother run their small restaurant in Isabela, Negros Occidental. Gilda hopes that all of her younger children will be able to finish their college education so that they could earn good incomes and provide for their own families.\r\n\r\nThe death of her husband left Gilda alone to raise her family, but she faced this trial with courage and conviction because her love and concern for her children transcended any difficulty that she experienced. She doubled her efforts knowing that she was the only one left who could provide for the family.\r\n\r\nEven with her recent loss, Gilda was not fazed by the trials that have come to her at that time. She knew that she could sustain her family if she held on and used her skills and knowledge in running a food business. This is not surprising because she's been doing it for quite a long time. She was already engaged in food vending long before she married her husband, and continued with it during her married life, becoming her husband's helpmate in supporting their large family. \r\n\r\nShe also trained her children while they were young and now they are also able to lend a hand in running the business when they had no school work. In 2006, Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could expand her business. As she paid off each loan on time and performing well as a member, Gilda gained access to larger loans which she fully made use of by expanding her operations even further. It now earns her a monthly net income of PHP 7,500.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 13,000 was used as additional capital for her business, and she was able to repay her loan on time without any delays. For her 7th cycle loan, she intends to borrow the same amount to be used as additional capital for her business and whatever income from it will be used for the education of her children and for her family needs.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":401837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Not having attended a modern school, he quickly began earning an income, notably through commerce in shoes eight years ago at the Bougouni market.  But this was unsuccessful.  And so he decided to learn about selling various store items with his brother-in-law.

She and her husband help each other in running their business. The couple lives in the village of Nabantu-an, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. Even while she is growing older, Milagros and her husband want to retain their independence by having their own business. Milagros is quite content that her 3 children have their own families and are all gainfully employed, earning enough to afford giving extra money to support their parents. Milagros is very aware that she needs to have proper nutrition now to stay healthy, and she also dreams to build a decent house for herself and her husband.\r\n\r\nMilagros always wanted to help her husband earn their living. She knew that if she only had the opportunity to use her cooking skills, she'd make a successful business, but before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, she did not have such an opportunity. But as soon as she became a member of NWTF-PD, she was able to set up her own \"carinderia\" an eatery or luncheonette selling and serving cooked food in a simple kitchen setup, adjacent to her house. Before long she had a loyal clientele and her food sold out fast each day, she had to frequently increase the volume she cooked each day. It was fortunate that she could borrow additional capital to address the growing opportunity that she was able to sustain and stabilize her business. Later, she even started investing in raising pigs as it would allow her to build savings. She only sold her pigs when she really needed the money. Her business ventures earn her an average income of PHP 5,000 per month and it is taking her one step nearer her dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan, she borrowed Php 10,000 on her 12th cycle and used it as additional capital for her businesses. She was able to return this loan in full without any delays. Now she is borrowing the same amount of Php 10,000 for her 13th cycle loan to use in her business in Carinderia and raising pigs.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":401986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

For a while, his store has not received customers from foot-traffic. It is for this reason that in 2006 he purchased a motorcycle to use as a taxi. He drives the moto-taxi himself and has given the management of his workshop over to an experienced tailor's apprentice. Thanks to the profitability of this new business, he opened a small  cellular telephone booth in his workshop. With these two businesses, he is able to properly handle his finances. He would like a credit from the micro-finance group WAGES to purchase cell-phone credit re-fill cards; he will use the remainder of the loan for repairs of his moto-taxi.
