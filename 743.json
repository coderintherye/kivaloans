Much like many other rural families, she and her husband fatten up livestock, after starting this business in 2003.  Today, Gulkayir's business has one dairy cow, five sheep, one bull and five goats.  Sales of milk, dairy products and meat allows her to earn about 8,000 som (KGS) per month.  Gulkayir is also involved in craftsmanship in her free time.  She makes pillows and blankets, which also serve as a small income for the family's budget.  In order to further grow her business, Gulkayir requested a loan in the sum of 40,000 som (KGS) form the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company for the purchase of sheep to fatten up and resell.  She plans to invest the profits from this loan into further increasing livestock headcount.  In the future, she plans to get involved in making repairs to her house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":951231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Much like many other families in the rural locale, Buuraima and her husband fatten up livestock, after starting this business in 2001.  Having used an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS) to start the business, today the business has four dairy cows, which allows Buuraima to earn about 4,000 som (KGS) per month from the sales of dairy products.  In order to increase milk production and further expand her business, Buuraima requested a loan in the sum of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase dairy cows.

He learned this trade from his maternal uncle, who was a big cereal trader in his time. With a view to meeting the demands of his growing customer base, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso. Having completed repayment of his first loan, this second personal loan will be used to purchase 2 tonnes of cereals (corn, beans, millet, fonio) from the rural producers in and around DONGORONA; this will then be stored for at least 3 months. He sells mostly in bulk to a customer base made up of resellers from the big cities such as Bamako.

She sells shoes and sandals every day in the city of Caman\u00e1, located in the south of Peru. This area is a vast and dry oasis in the Desierto de Sechura, which dominates the south-eastern coast of the country. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. However, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroyed the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1, as well as jobs, livelihoods, and homes. The result of this unemployment has been the creation of an atmosphere ripe for microfinancing. Microfinancing gives people with small businesses and few resources business opportunities in the labour market.\r\n\r\nLeonarda's husband is a master builder, and this brings in a good income. They use this money to invest in the small business, as well as in the care and education of their little children. The youngest is barely two years old, and the oldest is 8. Leonarda tells us that one of her favourite dishes is \u201cChupe de Camarones\u201d [Shrimp Chowder]. In Caman\u00e1 it is easy to find and enjoy this delicious dish because they are very close to the sea--this guarantees the freshness of the product.\r\n\r\nLeonarda is a woman who works an average of eleven hours a day. This allows her to make 130 Soles per day. With this money, she is able to pay the original cost of the shoes. She thinks that her business is successful because she provides good customer service and is very charismatic. Thanks to the Kiva lenders, she will be able to buy new merchandise to sell. This will allow her to provide better customer service, thus making a better income. Her dream is to be able to expand the size of her business and therefore increase her income in order to be able to thatch the roof of her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":154.67,"image":{"id":951613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy shoes and sandals to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-20T02:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":202.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":209.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":236.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":242.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":253.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":260.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":270.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":281.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":290.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":301.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":202.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":204.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142523,"comment":null},{"amount":78.72,"local_amount":209.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":212.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271109,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-08T16:05:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":372675,"name":"Aleyda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aleyda, de 34 a\u00f1os, es una mujer buena y amable, esta casada y es madre de cuatro hijos, quienes a\u00fan son menores y dependen de ellos para su educaci\u00f3n y alimentaci\u00f3n, ellos viven en una casa propia desde donde todos los d\u00edas salen a trabajar para as\u00ed poder brindar una mejor calidad de vida a su familia.

Although this work is going very well for him, the salary he earns is not sufficient to provide his family with a decent life, and so a few months ago he decided to establish a grocery store.  His wife runs the business, and with it he can earn additional income.  Ever since he started this business he has had a lot of difficulties because he didn't know how to manage this type of business, but over time and with experience it is improving every day.  He feels very happy in his work, because it is very gratifying to know that thanks to him, people can sleep securely.  He has been doing this work for 3 years, and so this will be his 6th loan with MFP.

She's doing very well since having two businesses means she earns twice as much for her household and it allows her to offer her family better living conditions.  What she likes most about her work is talking with her customers, since is makes her long workdays more enjoyable.  She has had this business for six years and she thinks the hardest part is moving the heavy cases of beer.  In the future, she hopes to set up a store where she can offer her clients better service.  This will be her sixth loan with MFP and she counts on their support to continue with her objectives.  She also promises to make her payments on time, as she did with her previous loans.  She is thankful for being part of the communal bank because all of its members are responsible, supportive people.  She will use the 2,5000 nuevos soles to buy ingredients for her business, as well as many cases of soft drinks and beer to have ready to sell for the holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":445.85,"image":{"id":951722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw material to prepare food and to buy cases of beer and soft drinks\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":377.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":398.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":397.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":428.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":454.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.52,"local_amount":377.69,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":386.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836347,"comment":null},{"amount":151.46,"local_amount":398.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":408.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246127,"comment":null},{"amount":150.87,"local_amount":397.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":406.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386143,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T21:02:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":372714,"name":"Angel Maria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las mujeres del presente comit\u00e9 son de la oficina de Caacup\u00e9.

He works in the city of Ica, which is currently known as one of the main cities in the country in which to invest.  This has been achieved thanks to the opening of new shopping malls with retailers from different parts of the country.  These big companies have given work opportunities to many more people.  This has also benefited those who do not work in these large shopping malls.  One case is that of Dairo who, thanks to the increase in the number of people and the great need that they have to move around, has been able to make more income with a lot of effort and commitment.\r\n\r\nDairo is a young man who very much likes playing football (soccer) in his free time.  This allows him to spend time with his friends.  Dairo works an average of 8 hours a day which allows him to make 45 soles a day.  One must bear in mind that the cost per trip via this mode of transport costs between 1 and 1.5 soles, depending on distance.  Dairo thinks that his business is successful because he starts work early and puts in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nDairo's mother encouraged him to start out in this business so that he could make his own income.

She has a common-law husband and three children, ages 28, 25 and 20.  The eldest two are already independent and leading their own lives.  The youngest is still at home since she is in school and depends on her parents to help her realize her dream of becoming a professional.  Virginia sells food and works at the city university where she has a food stand, offering customers the different dishes she prepares.  Among her customers are university students, professors and staff.  This work takes up half her time and the other half is dedicated to the various activities she also must carry out.  \r\n\r\nWhen she began her business she had many doubts and fears, but over time and with support from two workers she was able to get ahead and now her stand is the busiest.  Business has gone well in the two years she's been working and thanks to the earned income things are much better at home.  In the future she wants to continue growing and expand.  This is her first loan through MFP.  She is very happy with the financial support that will increase her working capital.  The 1,000 PEN loan wil be used to buy ingredients and supplies so she can continue working and add variety to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.92,"image":{"id":951800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To

Like many average Ukrainians, Svetlana never has enough money for quality and not cheap dental services, which are often a necessity, not a luxury. This time, Svetlana decided not to wait and skimp on her health, and therefore appealed for more financial aid to Kiva as her existing available cash is not enough for the entire course of treatment.

nine-year-old son on her own. Her husband lives and works in Russia, so she has to decide all the pressing issues. She was accustomed to care for the family's livelihood on her own, and that's why she began to engage in business a year ago. Her mother helped Olga, giving her money for the purchase of a trade pavilion. Olga gathered enough money on her own for the product itself. Now Olga sells wigs, purses, and handbags in one of the local markets of Nikopol, where she lives. \r\n\r\nOlga needs a Kiva loan of 8,000 hryvnia to buy a batch of handbags for sale in anticipation of the Christmas and New Year holidays. Olga carefully sought a provider of this type of product that would offer her quality bags at a reasonable price. She was able to find a good trade and also a large assortment, which gives her an enviable advantage over competitors. Olga is a young entrepreneur, very active and strives for constant development. She always says that, if the business will require an expansion, she will do its utmost to achieve

She is involved in selling women's clothing at her town's central market.  This is not her first year in this business, and she has a good retail location and affordable prices.  Over the 15 years of work, Antonina was able to increase her income, which now amounts to 7,000 hryvnia per month.  All together, her merchandise is currently worth 50,000 hryvnia.  Antonina requested a loan from Kiva in order to purchase an additional inventory of merchandise for the winter season.  She plans to invest 12,000 hryvnia into a purchase of an inventory of trousers for women.  A wide selection of multi-fabric trousers of various sizes would please many different tastes and preferences of Antonina's customers; thus, giving her an opportunity to earn more before the holidays.  After making an additional profit, Antonina hopes to purchase new household appliances for her

She began her entrepreneur adventure in 2004 when she set up a sewing service in her own home. Although it went well her aspirations were greater than what she could offer from that location.  She moved to a more commercial location where she rented a space and set up her machines and began meeting her production goals.  Gradually, as the business grew, she added a bazaar which she still has.  For her expansion plans Nuris needs to increase her working capital to meet growing customer demand and to keep up with the daily inventory turnover.  So she requested a Credikiva loan which is her first through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to use it to buy supplies such as fabric, thread and bobbins which she will use to make her designs and increase sales throughout December and January because of the holidays.  Her customers will wear her elegant dresses to the parties.  Her business is registered in the Chamber of Commerce and she has a fixed customer base in the nearby neighborhoods.  Her income comes mainly from the sewing classes she offers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.03,"image":{"id":952016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy supplies such as fabric, thread and bobbins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-20T21:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":72395},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":74862},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76609},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78396},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80225},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82097},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84013},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85973},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87979},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90032},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":92133},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":95286}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":297.03,"local_amount":565767,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":575045.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T04:48:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":372789,"name":"Mirian Gladis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirian naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Calca y vive en la misma ciudad donde naci\u00f3, ella tiene 47 a\u00f1os edad y es casada y fruto de esta uni\u00f3n tiene dos hijos, ella alterna sus actividades del hogar con su peque\u00f1o trabajo, ella trabaja en el cafet\u00edn  de la universidad de la ciudad de Calca y la pueden encontrar desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 3 de la tarde de lunes a viernes.
