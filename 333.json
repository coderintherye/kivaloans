Ana Christina has a business selling tamales; French bread, baguettes and rolls which are eaten daily at breakfast and dinners; and sweet bread, which is a type of bread made from a base of flour and sugar or honey that is very typical in this country and is very similar in flavor to cookies. She has had this business for some time now, and it allows her day by day to obtain the income she needs to be able to provide her small grandchildren with food and everything else that they need.  For this reason Ana Christina requests a loan through which she can buy a larger quantity of bread and also the raw materials needed to make tamales, because she makes these in her home.

is 34 years old and lives with his wife and two-year-old infant in Arhangai Province, Mongolia. He and his family live together in a \"ger\", a traditional Mongolian housing tent. Bathangai operates a shoe making business in his town. He specializes in making a variety of traditional Mongolian shoes such as the \"Buriad\" and the \"Mongol\". His business is especially busy during national holidays, celebrations and the wedding season in Mongolia. Bathangai started his business in 2004 with a working capital of 200,000 tugrugs (~140 USD). He has worked hard to grow his business over the last five years, but it has been difficult at times to lead a normal life. As his business is the only source of income for his family, he is focused on improving his skills as a shoemaker and growing his business.

lives with his wife and three children in Uvs province, Mongolia. He and his family live in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His two sons, aged 14 and 16, attend the local secondary school while the youngest, who is 1 year old, stays home with her mother. Ganbaatar operates a raw material  and meat trading business in his town. He sells animal skins, primarily sheep and goat skins during spring time. During winter, he mainly sells meat and meat products for which the price is higher than any other season. He started his business in 1997.

She is married, the mother of a 14-year-old, who also supports five other people. She has been a member of the U-IMCEC bank since February 2004 and has already received a loan. Mrs. S. has been developing an ice cream and breakfast business for ten years. She has a stall facing the Yoff bank. She chose this business because she has always wanted to live without depending on others. Thus with her profits she would be able to take care of her own personal needs. What interests her most about this business is interacting with her customers whom she enjoys, but also making a profit. She is seeking a loan of 50,000frs and looking to build up her working operating in order to buy several products for the breakfasts she sells.

It has 2,255 inhabitants.  San Juan Ahuehu\u00e9yo is at 1,160 meters in altitude.  It has an indigenous population of 262.  The indigenous languages are Nahuatl and Mixteco.  The population is economically active.  The meaning of \u201cAhuehu\u00e9yo\u201d comes from tree and its name in N\u00e1huatl is \u201cAhuehuete\u201d.  That is the name of the group that we will talk about.\r\n\r\nThe four members are Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3 Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda, Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S., Gina Rebeca L. G., and Emilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o.  The last one is who we will discuss.\r\n\r\nEmilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o\u2019s name does not have any significance.  She is 33, and she went to school until the third year of high school.  The school\u2019s name is Licendiado Benito Juarez, and it is in the same area.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy raw materials like bulk natural soy and bags of wheat by the kilo.  She makes natural products like wheat milanesa, soy chicharron, soy hamburgers, soy meatballs, and others.  She makes them herself without any chemicals.  Everything is natural.\r\n\r\nHer business does not yet have its own name.  She has been making and selling natural products for 15 years.  She learned together with her husband when they were working in a well-known restaurant in the center of Cuautla.  There they learned the job and the product.  Before starting the production of soy food they sold natural yogurt, fruit, and granola.  It did not go very well for them because they did not have the money to continue producing the dairy products.  But, upon learning to make the products like milanesa and sausages, etc. they saw that this was profitable.  They did not invest much, and they got more earnings.\r\n\r\nHer business is in her house, where she makes her product.  It is important to them to not add preservatives; everything they use is natural.\r\n\r\nShe has a great satisfaction from what she does and that her husband helps her in the business.  Her customers are her neighbors, and they are the best promotion she has where she lives.  She also sells her products in the area markets.  She has two very good buyers who buy wholesale.  She has the desire that someone will get to know them so that they can export their products to other states and they get to know the products.\r\n\r\nThe challenge in her business is the rise in prices of the raw material she uses.  This greatly affects her at vacation time because things don\u2019t sell the same then.\r\n\r\nEmilia has been married to Mariano V\u00e1squez Acevedo for 18 years.  They have four children.  The first is Domingo Vazquez H..  He is the oldest sibling, is 17, and he works independently.  The second is Emilio Vazquez H..  He is in the first year of high school with his brother, Mariano Vazquez H..  They are twins, and go to the same high school.  The little one is Gema Vazquez H..  She is 7, and she is in the second grade.\r\n\r\nEmilia describes her area as a place where there is lots of vegetation, fields, and corn, onion, sugar cane, and bean crops.  Upon entering her community we can observe all of this nature.\r\n\r\nHer house is small; there are three rooms.  They need to finish the walls and the floor, but it has a small garden, which is very pretty.  In the future she wants to give her three small children a good education and a better quality of life.  She was doubtful about the loan, and then it was granted.  She did not believe it was true.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use her own words to say the following, \u201cI am very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. institution because without their help we would not be able to make this small advance in our business.  It is also very good that they support women and single mothers because they are the ones who fight more to improve their quality of life.  They do not have anyone to join in this battle shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe joined the group by the invitation of Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S\u00e1nchez.  She is currently the group\u2019s representative, and she is the one who puts pizzazz in the group.  They are very united.  She is followed by Gina Rebeca L\u00f3pez Gatita.  She sells sweets in her area.  Then there is Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez who sells Mexican snacks (sandwiches) in the primary school cooperative, which is close to her community.  Finally, there is Emilia, who we have discussed.  They form the \u201cAhuehuete\u201d Communal Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":460615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Buy soy and wheat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T23:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":440.63,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5674.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080366,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3783.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916686,"comment":null},{"amount":367.19,"local_amount":4687.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4729.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952418,"comment":null},{"amount":73.43,"local_amount":937.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":945.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T04:20:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":166662,"name":"Margarita De Los Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Margarita de los Santos C.

Anatolia, 52, is married and the mother of 8 children.  She sells firewood from her home and also raises small farm animals like chickens, pigs and guinea pigs.

F. is from the town of Malibangcao Clarin Misamis Occidental. She is 63 years old. Felicidad is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Felicidad owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling firewoods in the local community. Felicidad has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Felicidad joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felicidad has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Felicidad is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Felicidad from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarita C. is from the village of Villa Cayaban. She is 40 years old. Clarita is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Clarita's Group.\r\n\r\nClarita is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Clarita owns & operates a business planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Clarita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clarita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. Clarita is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Clarita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlota J. is from the village of Carikkikan Norte. She is 27 years old. Carlota is the group leader of an 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Carlota J.'s Group.\n\nCarlota is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Carlota owns & operates a retail store selling vegetables in the local community. Carlota has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Carlota joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carlota is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Carlota from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":463242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda B. is from the village of Mararigue. She is 52 years old. Erlinda is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Erlinda's Group.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 28,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":463210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nMarilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase piglets to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marilyn from GDMPC.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 49 years-old. Liza is the leader of a ten member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLiza is widowed and has two adult children. Liza owns and operates a general store which sells both food and daily use products in the local community. Liza has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 500 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Liza is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Liza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and North-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":464092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

D. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 42 years old, married, and has three adult children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns and operates a business, buying and selling coconut in the local community. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $115 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined the Kiva field partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue that is generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":464777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to invest in

B. is 30 years old and is not yet married. He lives with his mother in Tuv province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. He currently has a girlfriend and plans on marrying soon.\r\n\r\nEnhbaatar has a small farm with nineteen milking cows. He started his farming business in 2007 with only eight milking cows. Since then, his mother helped in his business and he has been able to expand the business by adding eleven more milking cows.

Dafrosa is 42 years old, married, and has three children. Her son is the eldest at 21 years old, and her daughters are 17 and 10. All three of them are in school.\r\n\r\nDafrosa is a butcher by trade, and has been in the business since 2007. Her butcher shop opens at 7 a.m. every day, and closes whenever she runs out of meat or the stream of customers has ended. She estimates that she makes about 240,000 Tanzanian shillings per month, or about $180 dollars.\r\n\r\nThis will be Dafrosa's first loan from Tujijenge. She will use it to purchase more beef (\"nyama ya ng'ombe\" in Kiswahili), and a refrigerator that will help her preserve meat for longer and therefore reduce the amount she has to throw away. She hopes this will help her increase her profits.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Dafrosa is standing in the back row on the left wearing a pink scarf. She is shown with the other members of her group, most of whom are food vendors in nearby markets.

What interests her most in her business is the trips she makes and the profits she earns. She sells mainly to order.

is a 31-year-old university student and a single mother who lives with her two sons in La Suiza de Turrialba, a region in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. She has a business selling various products such as clothing, jewelry and cosmetics by going door-to-door in her community as well as at her university: Universidad de Florencio Castillos.\r\n\r\nThis will be Jessica\u2019s 3rd loan with Fundacion Mujer. Her 2nd was for 200,000 colons and was paid back on time and in full. She is happy to be applying for a larger amount (500,000 colons) than she has in the past.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s clients have been requesting a more diverse range of products such as hand creams and other items she currently does not offer. This loan will be used to satisfy those demands. Specifically, Jessica will use this loan to build up her inventory levels by purchasing larger quantities of products from her suppliers in San Jose. Jessica is confident that a larger volume in purchases will guarantee her a lower price and allow for higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nJessica says that her lack of working capital is her main limitation. Testaments to her acute business sense are her ability to triple her client base since she opened her business in 2007 and her success in implementing and enforcing a policy for her credit clients (people who buy clothes on credit) of no more than 60 days of credit.\r\n\r\nPrior to enrollment in university and starting her own business, Jessica worked as a receptionist for two years. She says \u201cI enjoyed my job, but I didn\u2019t see myself there permanently.\u201d She started her business in order to earn a supplemental income with an initial investment of 100,000 colons from her first loan with Fundacion Mujer. With her business, in a good month she can earn 400,000 colons, in a bad month only 200,000.\r\n\r\nWhen she isn\u2019t making sales or taking care of her children, Jessica attends classes in the afternoons and at night. The income she generates from sales is the only source of family income other than 80,000 colons per month she receives from the father of one of her sons.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s dream job would be to become either a radiologist or a family lawyer. However, she has decided to study special education, to be able to teach children with mental and physical disabilities. She is in her first term of a four-year program and has decided to become a teacher because it will allow her spend more time with her children.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s goals are to provide a better quality of living for her children. It is important to her that she raise her sons to have strong principles.\r\n\r\nJessica is an accomplished, determined and competent entrepreneur shown by her ability to build a house, attend university and take care of her two children. Since opening her business, her client base has grown significantly, a demonstration of her ability to effectively use past loans to strengthen her business. In order to balance her numerous demanding daily responsibilities, Jessica has become adept at time management. When her children are sleeping, Jessica studies or cleans the house; in the afternoons, she makes sales in the community; in the evenings, she attends night classes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":465014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

He hopes some day to be able to build a small house close to the farm so that he can care for his crops.  With this end in mind, the M. family works hard in pineapple farming.  They need funding to buy agricultural products that will help provide the optimum crop yields and the best quality of product so that it will sell quickly and at a price that will recoup the investment.

Since she was a little girl, she was raised in an agricultural and cattle raising milieu, learning her trade well from her parents.  Now that she cares for her own cattle and sheep, what she learned from them as served her well.  She also farms potato, corn, peas, and flat beans, among others; this has become her primary source of income as well as provided for her family's own consumption.  Her children, who are her pride and joy, constantly help her with her chores.  Her greatest wish is to restore her cowshed so that her cattle can have the best care in order to strengthen their growth.  This is her eleventh loan with MFP.  She is considered to be a very active and cooperative member of her group.  Besides, she is always committed to repaying her loans on time.  This funding will be used to buy sacks of natural fertilizer for alfalfa planting as well as for fodder for her cows and to buy a bull.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":465148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fodder for her cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T01:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2511.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933937,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-07T04:58:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
