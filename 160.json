(greetings) from Tanzania! This is Christina K., a 38-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has four children, who are between the ages of 12 and 16 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nChristina has been running a charcoal sales business since 2007: these small, black, dirty pieces of dry earth are important to the people of Tanzania because they rely on charcoal to cook meals on a daily basis. Indeed, many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, the charcoal-selling business is quite lucrative. She works at her business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, though she notes that she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Christina currently earns approximately $55 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to purchase more charcoal for resale purposes. In the future, she plans to expand her charcoal business. Christina thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional charcoal ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T18:50:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436336,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130608,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027405,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613406,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010486,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232785,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664601,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105332,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022477,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867727,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T22:09:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79643,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cI\u2019 am positive that I will be able to improve my family's life someday and I can generate money to repair our house and send all my children to school,\u201d Myrna said. \r\n\r\nMyrna S. sells different kinds of vegetables, fish, meat, and other items.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is Frida M., a 26-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are both 3 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nFrida M. has been running a stationary business since 2006. The stationary sales business allows micro-entrepreneurs to demonstrate their business savvy; to illustrate, most such entrepreneurs place their shops, stalls, or tables strategically close to post offices, banks, schools, and universities in order to generate as much income as possible. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week. By doing so, Frida is able to earn approximately $300 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy a printer and additional paper to better meet her customers' demands. In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of stationary. Frida thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is Eva M., a 38-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is single and has two children, who are 8 and 12 years old, respectively. <p>\r\n\r\nEva has been running a clothing sales business since 2004. In particular, she sells clothes such as vitambaa (materials), vitenga (African traditional clothes with wax prints), and kanga. She works at her business 8 hours per day and 6 days per week, though she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Eva is able to earn approximately $80 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy more materials to make more clothes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Eva M. thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is Aisha K., a 28-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is single and has two children, who are 5 and 8 years old, respectively. <p>\r\n \r\nAisha has been running a tailoring business since 2006. Indeed, she purchases vitambaa (materials), vitenge (traditional Tanzanian clothes with wax prints), and kanga (printed cotton fabrics, often with borders along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, primarily for women. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week, though she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Aisha is able to earn approximately $295 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy additional vitambaas, vitenges, and kangas. In the future, she plans to add even more clothes to her inventory. Aisha thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional materials, clothes, and fabrics ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T19:40:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436339,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130611,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027408,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613409,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T21:17:45Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79650,"name":"Mercedez","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cSincerity and patience are the attitudes that a businesswoman like me must have.

This is Mariamu M., a 39-year-old woman from Mwanza.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To expand her business by purchasing three sewing machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T22:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436340,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130612,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027409,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613410,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010490,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232787,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664603,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105334,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022479,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867729,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T00:23:30Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79652,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!

As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional women's cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T22:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436341,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130613,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027410,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613411,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010491,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232788,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664604,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105335,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022480,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867730,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T15:17:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79653,"name":"Nou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nou R., 52, is married and lives with three of her children and her husband in the Prey Veng province, Cambodia.

This is Asha B., a 45-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are 10 and 26 years old, respectively. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting another dependant (an orphan--his parents did not care about him, so Asha took him into her family). <p>\r\n\r\nAsha has been operating a beauty salon since 2006. At her beauty salon, customers are able to buy any type of hair (long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, or blue hair) for their head, then have such hair attached to their heads, woven, cut, or braided, and finally made to look like their own hair. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week, though she is assisted by 2 employees. By doing so, Asha is able to earn approximately $600 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy more salon products (e.g., weaving materials, short hair, long hair, and curly hair). In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of hair care products. Asha thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional salon products (e.g., weaving materials, short hair, long hair, and curly hair)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T23:01:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436342,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130614,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027411,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613412,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010492,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232789,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664605,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105336,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022481,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T03:41:21Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79659,"name":"Oam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oam M., 44, is married and lives in the Prey Veng province with her husband and two children.

B. is 48 years old, married,  and the mother of five children who are currently in school. She has manufactured palm oil for 20 years. Palm oil is produced from palm fruits. Palm oil is used to prepare many local dishes. Her production is on a small scale because she does not have enough money to buy a machine for the processing. She wants to use the loan to buy more palm fruits and an electric milling machine so she can produce the oil in larger quantities.

F., a.k.a FF, is 40 years old.

Palm oil is produced from palm nuts while palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel. She produces the oil and supplies it to food vendors so they can prepare their meals. She normally switches her production between the two products. That is, after producing palm oil she automatically obtains the raw material to produce palm kernel oil.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more bags of palm nuts and an electric milling machine so she can produce the oil in larger quantities. She believes this increased production will augment her income so she can better provide for her family and finance her children\u2019s education.

He has very good relations with large service industries, institutions, businesses that often give him contracts and he cannot meet the demand anymore because of the increase in the price of boards. This is why, he would like to go to farms and villages to buy in bulk and build up a large stock of boards.

","en":"Gulzoda N. is 28 years old and is married.  She stays home and takes care of farm animals.  Her father and husband help with growing the livestock for the market.  Goats and sheep are their primary animals.  Gulzoda\u2019s father is very experienced and knowledgeable about the animals\u2019 proper diet.  The goats and sheep are given the feed and oats monthly in order to accelerate their growth.  Once fully grown, the animals are sold at a market.  The father advises to purchase new livestock right away to feed them for the market again.  This cycle allows Gulzoda and her family to support them and to repay their loan on-time.  Gulzoda\u2019s husband is often gone because he travels to other countries for work to help support the family.  They have yet to have children, so it is easy for Gulzoda to take care of the livestock now.   Her husband and father will help with the business once she has children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

Today, she is married and the mother of three and lives with her husband in the village of Mom\u00e9 Balim\u00e9.   A very courageous woman, she is in the palm nut business.   Generally, she buys  whole nuts that she shells before reselling to buyers, who extract the palm oil.  Yet the lack of financial means remains the most recurring problem she has.  And so, she is requesting a loan that she would like to use to increase her purchases and her sales figures.  This will enable her to have working capital for making a lot of significant income. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

They call their group \"God Is With Us\". They have received several loans through SMT. They have re-paid previous loans successfully. Their previous loan was for Le 1,000,000 each. That loan helped them a lot. They were able to make a lot of profit from the loan, thus able to solve many of their problems. Today, they are requesting a new loan for Le 1,200,000 each to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nAbdul (front right) is the leader of this group. Abdul was born in Roketeh, six miles from the city of Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. He is thirty-five years of age, married with two children \u2013 one is in nursery school and the other is only an infant. Abdul also cares for two of his deceased elder brother\u2019s children who are attending school. Abdul\u2019s wife is a businesswoman. Abdul sells ready-to-wear clothes.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of Le 1,200,000, Abdul will buy about forty pairs of jeans and four dozen shirts. He travels to neighboring Guinea to buy the clothes, paying a round\/trip fare of Le 60,000. In Guinea, a pair of trousers costs Le 25,000.  He sells each pair in Sierra Leone for Le 30,000.  \r\n\r\nThe only challenge Abdul is facing is that of bad debts. Sometimes relatives will borrow money from him and will never pay back. Apart from this, business is going fine and he enjoys doing it. Outside of his business, Abdul would like to do great things for himself. He would like to buy a plot of land for his family and eventually build a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":239795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"buying more jeans and shirts to sell in his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":8400000,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885073,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434522,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128915,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025704,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611607,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008508,"comment":null},{"amount":311.12,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230849,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662618,"comment":null},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102854,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-04T19:28:27Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79727,"name":"Eric Kodjo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nN\u00e9 en 1982 \u00e0 Vogan, Monsieur A.

They have called their group \"Atamu\". They have received several loans through SMT. They have re-paid previous loans successfully. They each received Le 1,000,000 in their previous loan. That loan helped them a lot. They were able to make a lot of profit from the loan, and thus were able to solve many of their problems. Today, they are requesting a new loan for the same amount of Le 1,000,000 each to add to their businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nKadiatu (left) is the leader of this group. Kadiatu was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. She is forty-three years of age, married with five children \u2013 one in college, one in secondary school, one in primary school, one in nursery school and the last is not yet of school age. Her husband is a businessman, too. <P>\r\n\r\nKadiatu sells groundnuts (peanuts).  She has been in this business for 20 years now. With this loan of Le 1,000,000, Kadiatu will buy about five bags of groundnuts to add to her business. She travels to the village of Bamoi to buy the groundnuts. The fare to Bamoi is Le 15,000 and she pays a Le 6,000 delivery fee for each bag of groundnuts.

Agnes was born in Kabala, Koinadugu district, in northern Sierra Leone. She currently resides in Makeni where she is married and runs her business. Her husband is a teacher and they have four children. Two of the children are in secondary school and two are in primary school. Agnes sells both \u201cgara lappers\u201d (locally dyed cloth with fabricated designs) and eggs. She has been in business for over ten years now. This will be her very first loan through SMT. She is requesting a loan of SSL 2,000,000 to help her strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Agnes will expand her business by buying more goods to add to her current stock. She will invest part of the loan in her gara lapper business and part into her egg business. She purchases the eggs in Freetown for SSL 100,000 per carton. The fare to Freetown is SSL 24,000 round trip. There is a SSL 1000 delivery charge for each carton of eggs transported with her from Freetown. \r\n\r\nShe buys the materials used for making gara lappers \u2013 inks, soda, white cotton material, etc. \u2013 here in Makeni.  A piece of white cotton cloth costs her SSL 95,000 in Makeni. She estimates she will be able to get at least nine cartons of eggs and seven pieces of white cotton cloth with the loan.  She will use the balance of the loan to buy inks, soda, and powder and to pay designers to design the white cotton cloth in different styles and patterns. \r\n\r\nThough business on the whole is going fine for Agnes, she does, however, face two great challenges \u2013 bad debtors and sometimes slow sales. Some of her customers refuse to pay her on time while some do not repay their debts at all. This instills fear in her as a businesswoman, making it a challenge for her to know who to trust and who not to trust.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she receives through SMT, Agnes is expecting a vast improvement in her business and an incremental increase in the amount of profit she makes. The increase in profit will be reinvested into the business, some will be saved for future use and the remainder will be used to assist her husband in providing food for their household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":239811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase supplies of cloth making material and eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-17T08:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":405405,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885075,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434524,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128917,"comment":null},{"amount":67.49,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025706,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611609,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008510,"comment":null},{"amount":67.51,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230851,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662619,"comment":null},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":202702.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102856,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T15:18:43Z","paid_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79736,"name":"Abass","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abass is a 19 year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon.

She has been in the business for twelve years. She began her business only selling tamales and ice cream, but the need to earn more money made her look for other products to sell. It was in this way that she began to sell corn, which she buys in the Terminal market in the capital city. She brings it to her village of Chixolis in Santiago Sacatepequez, where she sells her products among her neighbors and friends. As she got more clients, they asked Elfida for other things. Because of this, she began to sell eggs, soda water, and clothes. She has 4 children, and her husband helps her in her business. She wants to invest the loan to buy more merchandise because it is cheaper to buy at wholesale. She wants to have a well-stocked business so that she can also increase her earnings. Her goals are to be able to continue improving her house. She has already fought with a lot of strength to have her own house, since she and her husband are originally from the Southern coast of the country.

It's been a good bit of time that we've worked on this business but always in a very limited manner.  This is due to a lack of financial means which prevent us from producing on a large scale.  The product we make is highly sought after in the local marketplace and in the region.  Producing in sizable quantities is the reason why we have come to request a loan from Kiva.  We could then meet the burgeoning demand.  This financing will also enable us to lift ourselves out of poverty, in which all of us live every day, by allowing us to cope with school fees for our children and to support our husbands in our

Martha thanks you for her support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more stock of beer for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-17T10:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436343,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130615,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027412,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613413,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010493,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232790,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664606,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105337,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022482,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T14:00:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79793,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eugenia considers the education of her children as the best treasure that she can give them because it is the only treasure that will not fade away.

This client\u2019s business is in selling vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, mainly for women. She works at the business for eight hours per day, six days per week, and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more materials for making clothes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-17T10:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436344,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130616,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027413,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613414,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010494,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232791,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664607,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105338,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022483,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867733,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T12:10:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79795,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cThe loss of my husband did not become a hindrance for me to keep moving and working for our daily living,\u201d a widow from Barangay Malamag East Tumauni, Isabela, said.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-17T11:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436345,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130617,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027414,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613415,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010495,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232792,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664608,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105339,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022484,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T13:26:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79797,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cI was running out of stock that\u2019s why I need to buy additional sacks of rice,\u201d Epifania says.

My children depend on my business, which thankfully allows me to provide them food and education.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":239990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"For the purchase of plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2008-12-21T07:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884172,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433617,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27127951,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024747,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610652,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53007450,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3345.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661299,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":5000.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-17T10:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5018.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101331,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1666.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1672.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018375,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

to purchase bran, as feed for the chicken.<br \/><p><sT.>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva

In 1996, she became a member of the TYM Fund and borrowed money to buy fishing nets.  Since 2003, she and her family have invested capital in raising animals to improve their financial situation.  Today, Mrs. \u0110\u00e0o and her husband raise both sows and porkers (pigs raised for meat) by their house, and their children all have steady employment.  The total family income is now about 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month and the financial situation of the family is steadily becoming more secure.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to purchase more breeding pigs and animal feed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

She became a member of the TYM Fund in 1996, borrowing money to invest in raising pigs.  In 2002, she and her family used a loan to run a model fish farm in a pond belonging to the local co-operative.  Today, her family has 400 laying ducks, two groups of sows, and one fish pond, which together provide an income of about 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to buy feed for her animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

This is why the women got organized into a group.  They prefer to be active in the socio-economic advancement of all its members by participating in the development of their community.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe objective of this loan is to bolster their business of processing local grain.  This is work they've already mastered, and it is centered on purchasing local grain (millet, corn, sorghum) and then proceeding to process it.  The sale of the resulting products \"thiacri\" and \"araw\" (the Senegalese names) will allow the loan to be repaid without much difficulty.  The turnover of these products pose no problem because the quantity to be sold is less than the level of demand.  This loan will allow them to improve the quality and quantity of the goods to be sold.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":240291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

is 38 years old and lives with his wife and 2 children. Recently he has gotten involved in agriculture, as his parents were farmers in their area and now he wishes to follow in their footsteps. For this reason he is giving his all to his land, where he is busy all day long. The harvest is what gives him the most pleasure from his work, since he can pick the products that cost him so much work in cultivating and caring. Nevertheless, the most difficult thing is acquiring the fertilizers necessary for his plots, since they are very expensive and raise the level of investment required in production. Zarifjon draws strength from his 2 children, whom he supports so that they may become professionals. He wishes to invest in the various fertilizers he needs for his crops, so that he can increase his production and his profits.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. works selling shoes from her own stall inside the clothing market in the beautiful town of Istaravshan, Tajikistan. She has spent the last 11 years dedicating herself to this business. The business generates enough income in order to be able to live with dignity. lMON has provided Matluba with financial help for the last year, which has allowed her to increase her stock and ensure her three children\u2019s sustenance. She currently has a pressing need to acquire more shoes for the winter season in order to market them, and for this reason she came to IMON looking for more support. Her goal is to continue expanding and improving her business every day, considering that her husband's job as a driver does not earn enough and her children have no steady work. So, Matluba has to work hard in order to improve their living conditions. Matluba is very grateful to everyone who is helping her. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hardworking entrepreneur from Istaravshan, a city in the northern part of Tajikistan. She and her husband have three children. She runs a business where she sells kids' shoes at the busy central market in Istaravshan. Gulchira started her business 15 years ago and has run it with both extreme care and seriousness. It is an important source of income for her family of five, considering that her husband is currently unemployed. Gulchira has requested a loan of 2000 Somoni ($600) so that she can purchase additional inventory of winter boots for children and continue developing her business. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

farming is a traditional occupation in northern Tajikistan, especially in Dilafruz\u2019s village. Having a fairly large amount of land surrounding her house, this mother of four decided to try growing vegetables. Neither she nor her husband has been able to find steady employment, and she has been observing the success of her relatives and neighbors who sell vegetables at the market. She has experience growing and selling produce and wants to now do so more intensively to generate more income for her family. She has many ideas about how to be competitive by growing the right crops in a certain way, and she is sure that she will do well. She is requesting a loan to purchase mineral fertilizer and seeds so she can grow her business. Dilafruz sincerely thanks you for your generous heart. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The first loan enabled us to understand how to earn a living by working honestly and to see how to save money.  This time, we want to see to it that our business, which is the marketing of various products, is more formalized because, with this loan amount, we will have a greater ability to meet the demand and also to handle the seafood products being sold by our fishermen, who are active in our eco-village.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Married and the mother of three, Ms. Lina A. was born on June 18, 1978 and currently resides in An\u00e9ho, where she works.  A hairdresser by trade, she lacks sufficient means to open a salon to fulfill her efforts.  To address her needs and those of her children, she sells ice cubes and ice water.  This business is very profitable, especially during heat waves when the demand is very high.  She is requesting financing to buy another freezer for large-scale production in order to satisfy her customers fully.  This will enable her to make her business more worthwhile and to derive more revenues from it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She opens her stall at 6:00 in the morning and closes it at 7:00 in the evening unless there are still customers who need tending. At present, she wants a loan amounting to PHP 15,000 for the renovation of the beauty salon so that it will become more comfortable for her customers. Also, part of the loan proceeds will be used in her restaurant to buy raw foods like vegetables, meat, fish, chicken, other ingredients, etc.\r\n\r\nSince all her children are still studying in

In the near future, Tabitha will also offer child welfare programs and post-abortion care for women who have suffered from illicit abortions. <p>\r\n\r\nBefore starting the clinic, Tabitha was working in a large hospital. She ended her employment there when she saw the need in her own local community for a medical provider, and she opened up a small clinic where she employs one other person. Tabitha has a good flow of patients, but as they are all of low income, she does not have a strong profit margin. <p>\r\n\r\nTabitha is applying for a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings in order to improve her clinic and the services it provides to the community. With the loan money she will purchase equipment such as a pressure cooker to sterilize instruments, a speculum, and a patient examination couch. Tabitha wants to expand the clinic and will use some of the loan money to pay the rent for another room in her building. She also wants to repaint and partition off space for a waiting room for her clients.

N. K. started his health clinic in Elburgon, Kenya (near Nakuru) in 1997. For over ten years, he has been providing medical services to the local community, including curative services, out-patient care, family planning, minor surgeries, wound stitching, and circumcisions. Thanks to training from the Kisumu Medical and Education Trust, he is now also able to begin to provide post-abortion care for women. Abortion is illegal in Kenya, but many women receive the procedure illicitly, which can result in severe medical harm and death. James received the K-MET training in order to reduce the number of maternal mortalities by providing care to women who have suffered from botched abortions and counseling them on family planning.<p>\r\n\r\nJames formerly worked as a nurse for the government, but the pay was not sustainable. He opened a private clinic and has been able to achieve in private practice what he was unable to working for the government. The clinic, open from 8am \u2013 8pm Monday through Saturday, is made up of 3 rooms and James currently employs one other attendant. The patients are from the rural community, often from farming families of low economic status.<p>\r\n\r\nJames is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings in order to expand the services of his clinic. At present, he is unable to provide immunizations, so he would like to use the loan money to purchase a refrigerator, which will allow him to store the materials needed to give immunizations. The fridge will cost about 15,000 Kenyan Schillings. He also needs equipment for his laboratory, such as a microscope that costs about 25,000 schillings. An expanded laboratory will allow him to conduct more tests and provide a wider range of service. This, alongside providing immunizations, will attract more patients and increase the workload of the clinic. He may need to hire another employee. James is 47 years old, married with 3 children - one girl who is 15 years old and two boys, who are 10 and 2 years old. His goal for the future of the clinic is to include maternity services and perhaps inpatient services as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":226026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical Clinic","sector":"Health","use":"To

N. is a 61-year-old nurse who is married with 5 children, all adults. Three of his children are living in the United Kingdom, while 2 are in Nakuru, Kenya. <p>\r\n\r\nZephania opened the Gilgil Community Clinic in Gilgil, Kenya (near Nakuru) in 1992. Before running a private clinic, Zephania worked for the government as a registered nurse, becoming involved in projects of public and clinical education. He stopped working for the government because he believed that people in his area could benefit from his nursing skills in a community health clinic. For 16 years, the women and children in this rural area have continued to benefit from his decision.<p>\r\n\r\nThe Gilgil Community Clinic offers curative services, maternal and child health care, and reproductive health care including post-abortion care (which helps reduce the maternal mortality rate of women suffering from poorly performed illegal abortions) and family planning. <p>\r\n\r\nThe clinic consists of four rooms and employs 2 nurses and one cleaner. Zephania wants to expand on the clinic\u2019s laboratory services and hopes to be able to hire a laboratory technician in the future.<p>\r\n\r\nZephania is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings in order to purchase a fridge, drugs for immunizations, equipment for the post abortion care procedures, and a microscope for lab work. With a refrigerator, Zephania will be able to stock the drugs needed for immunizations and offer this new service to his patients. <p>\r\n\r\nZephania has recently been trained by the Kisumu Medical and Education Trust to perform post-abortion care, and he needs certain equipment, such as a speculum, in order to offer this service. Zephania is committed to preventing mother to child transmission of HIV, and a new microscope will allow the clinic to do bloodwork on children and pregnant mothers. At this time, Zephania must send the patients to the subdistrict hospital for bloodwork, where the procedure takes a very long time. Zephania would like to be able to offer all the necessary services under the clinic\u2019s roof, so that there is no need to send patients elsewhere.

In order to perform the necessary procedures, Julius now needs to purchase certain instruments. He is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings (1,200 USD) in order to buy instruments, a refrigerator, a microscope for laboratory services, and if funds allow, a television for the clinic\u2019s waiting room. Currently, Julius is forced to send blood samples out to a lab technician to analyze. With a microscope in the clinic, Julius will hire a lab technician full time to do the analysis in-house. <p>\r\n\r\nJulius is working alone at the clinic now, but he hopes to employ one or two more people within the next year.
