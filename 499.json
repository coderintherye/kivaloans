As a newly recognized member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program, Salma is requesting a loan of Php 15,000 as her 1st loan which will be used as additional capital for her existing sari-sari store. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, making loan repayments, paying for her children\u2019s education and possible business expansion.\n\n About PMPC:\n\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAngelina, who is married and has two school-aged children, owns and operates a specialized retail store selling personal products such as glasses and watches in the local community. Engaged in her business for over three years, she earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Angelina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Having repaid her previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be Angelina's second loan from ASKI, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her main goal is to see her business grow so that she can begin saving money to help her son get ahead, by giving him a good education and a bright future.\r\n      \r\nHilda became part of the \"Las Naranjas\" group through an invitation from her neighbor Vitalina, who encouraged her to join in order to be able to get the funds to fully stock her store.\r\n      \r\nThe members of the \"Las Naranjas\" group are:\r\n\r\nRosalinda Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez: She will use her loan to buy clothing, which she sells in nearby communities.\r\nMar\u00eda Vitalina S\u00e1nchez D.

She lives in her own home with her husband and three children.  She has been raising animals for 17 years.  She buys her animals at a low price and early stage of development to then fatten them and sell them at a higher price.  She also milks her cows to sell to her neighbors which earns her some extra income.  Sometimes her children help her in raising her animals which leaves her free to look after her potato, corn and grass crops.  The grass crops serve as fodder for her animals.  Throughout the years, Delfina has seen how her work has developed and she therefore would like to expand her stable and acquire cows and bulls of good breed.\r\n\r\nThis is Delfina's 11th loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support and likes being part of her community bank because all the members are people who she knows.  They are responsible and very supportive of each other.  She thanks those who will help fund her loan since it will be very useful in making progress in her business.  She will use her loan to invest in buying sacks of fertilizer to grow fodder and also to buy a cow of good breed.  The loan will be part of the money she needs and the rest will come from her own resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":644908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a cow and sacks of fertilizer for her pasture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-21T13:41:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2525.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195787,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-21T18:56:53Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":250303,"name":"Nuevo Horizonte Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El presente comit\u00e9 se encuentra, en su d\u00e9cimo cuarto ciclo. \nEs un grupo que se encuentra  trabajando para salir delante de manera  muy responsable, cada una de  las integrantes tienen sus actividades en donde trabajan. \nLa Sra.

It is a small group, but a very united one, and the members have known each other for several years.  They decided to call themselves Kikas because, in their town, it is how Jazm\u00edn\u2019s daughters are known.  She is the group\u2019s representative, and there are six members in the group:  \r\n\r\n1.- Jazm\u00edn A. G., 29 years old\u2028\r\n2.- Gelacio G. S., 35 years old\r\n\u20283.-Ambrocio G. S., 38 years old\r\n\u20284.-Ana Luisa M. N., 35 years old\u2028\r\n5.-Marcelina T. C., 29 years old\u2028\r\n6.-Cecilia Garc\u00eda T., 21 years old\r\n\r\nThe 6 people mentioned are neighbors and friends in the community.  They formed the group because each person had good references from another member.  The community where they live is very humble and a place where, in general, people earn a living farming or raising animals such as:  cows, chickens and sheep.  These are the activities the people know and can relate to.  Most women are homemakers, and the women in this group are no exception.  However, they are women that want to get ahead and support their husbands with the household and children expenses.  This is also the case with Jazm\u00edn.\r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn appears on the right side of the photograph, wearing a red sweatshirt with the number 53.  She is a very hard-working woman, married for 10 years, who lives with her husband and 4 children:\r\n\r\nThe oldest is an 11-year old daughter who is in primary school.  She tells us she is very smart, and a young girl who applies herself.  After her, is a 9-year old daughter who is also in primary school and attends the same school as her older sister.  She tells us she has difficulty with math.  After this daughter comes a son who is only 2, and another daughter, who is 1.\r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn owns her house, a fact that gives her some peace because she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, which would be one more household expense.  Her husband works as a mechanic\u2019s assistant, but she tells us he doesn\u2019t earn much.  He hasn\u2019t left this work because it would be difficult for him to find a job earning more money since he didn\u2019t finish secondary school.  These days, employers are requiring at least having completed preparatory school.  Jazm\u00edn\u2019s family lives in a difficult situation, but she wants to put forth great effort and not see herself defeated.  She wants to forge ahead for her daughters.  For this reason, she started with a small business, which, all the same, generates income.  Jazm\u00edn sells \u201cjarceria\u201d, which is the business of selling plastic goods.  Jarceria is everything that has to do with plastics.  For example, trash bins, water tanks, buckets, spoons, chairs, tables, etc.  What Jazm\u00edn does is buy these products by the dozen, and returns to her community to sell them door-to-door.  This is a tough job, because she has to carry her products, along with her 1-year old baby, and no ordinary woman would be motivated to do this.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is Jazm\u00edn\u2019s daily bread, and she doesn\u2019t get discouraged; rather, to the contrary, she wants to get ahead and thinks only of her children and of providing them with a brighter future.  \r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn, along with her group, are trustworthy members, neighbors, and hard-working people who, like Jazm\u00edn, seek to get ahead and support their households.  This is why they\u2019ve requested a loan.  Jazm\u00edn is thinking about investing her loan into buying merchandise by the dozen, because it is cheaper to buy by the dozen or in sets.  From the moment she buys in bulk, she is making a profit via this means.\r\n\r\nThe other members of Kikas devote themselves to the following:  Mr. Gelacio and Mr. Ambrocio raise livestock, and these two have requested the loan to buy cows who might yield calves in the future.  Ms. Ana Luisa sells catalog items, in this case clothing, but she didn\u2019t have the funds to continue investing in her business, which motivated her to seek support.  Ms. Marcelina and Ms. Cecilia dedicate themselves to commerce at a food stand they open on a daily basis at a local market.\r\n\r\nThis is Jazm\u00edn\u2019s group.  They are six members with slightly different activities, but who all yearn to get ahead.

She gets up very early in the morning to prepare her 'chipa' so that she can go out and sell it.  She sells her product as a street trader.  Her niece and husband help her with her sales.\r\n\r\nAgustina would like to give special thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for the support which they have provided because it has enabled her to acquire more capital and thereby expand her business as she now has more 'chipa' sellers.

If he does not get the loan he says \u201cI probably would still be doing [business], but struggling a bit more.\u201d\r\n\r\nHomero has two sons. His wife works at a drug rehab center for children. Homero is proud of his business and he advises other business owners to \u201ctake it day by day.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2839.45,"image":{"id":643979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

the past 10 years, Alida G. has wanted to open her own business. Now, she is finally starting a food booth. She plans to attend at least three fairs a month along the gulf. \u201cThen, once I have enough money, I\u2019ll open up a commissary in a stable location. The food booth is a way to get my foot in the door.\u201d Her original plan was to \u201cget a trailer and RV and just hit a new beach every Sunday, but the oil spill killed that plan.\u201d \r\n\r\nAlida G. has survived both Katrina and a debilitating medical condition, and is ready to get off of social security disability benefits. \u201cBefore I was disabled, I had really good credit.  I could walk into any bank and get a loan for anything. When they put me on that medicine, I lost everything \u2013 my house, everything.\u201d The medicine made it hard for her to think. Recently, her diagnosis was changed, along with her treatment. \u201cI\u2019m feeling so much better\u2026 I\u2019m ready to get on with my life.  I\u2019m tired of being poor.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlida will use the loan to pay for the first three months of booth rentals, along with her equipment.  She plans to stock up on food and to buy a couple freezers, a nacho machine, a generator, ice chests, and a barbeque grill for cooking up hotdogs and ravioli and hamburgers. She\u2019ll sell \u201csnowballs, of course\u201d but she\u2019s really excited about the grilled ravioli. \u201cThey\u2019re very good \u2013 and it\u2019s unique! They\u2019re definitely on the menu.\u201d She will also buy a fan to cool the tent in the summer and to keep the smoke out of the tent.  \r\n\r\nIf not for this loan, Alida says she would probably sell her truck and other belongings in order to fund her business, or she might not have the funds to start it at all. \r\n\r\nShe really wants to be financially independent. \u201cThe profit margin on a snowball stand is so large that if you fail, there\u2019s something wrong with you.  As long as you\u2019re frugal, this is the way to go.  Everyone I\u2019ve talked to who\u2019s in it has loved it.\u201d  \r\n\r\nWhen she is more stable, Alida wants to get a house loan to make repairs. \u201cWe still have storm damage from Katrina. \u2026That\u2019s one of the main reasons I want to get off of social security. I want homeowners insurance so I don\u2019t have to go through this again.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlida also has a clear vision for her business. \u201cIn five years, I\u2019d like to have five more permanent locations somewhere.  ...  In 20 years, I want to be all across the gulf coast and start working my way up the east coast.\u201d Eventually she wants to \u201ctake the main office location and turn it into an ice park.  It\u2019s going to have a massive tube ride.  \u2026 and it\u2019ll be landscaped, with nothing but pine trees with the snow on them. \u2026 I\u2019ll set areas aside for handicapped kids.  And things to help save the glaciers \u2013 little educational things. And ice rinks and swimming pools.  It\u2019ll be just like visiting somewhere up north in the winter, only in the south.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlida is trying to figure out how to legally hire her roommate (also pictured in the photo), who is also disabled and currently helping with the business.  Her roommate is her co-borrower on the loan.\r\n\r\nHer advice to other people starting a business is \u201cdon\u2019t give up.

Her main source of income is farming.  She works on her land together with her sons.  They ask for help from their community because currently, as was the case in the time of the Inca,  there exists the famous AYNI system (a form of communal work where neighbors help each other on their lands at sowing and harvest time).  Agustina grows potatoes and corn which she then sells.  This is how she supports herself and helps her children with their studies.

To make a living, she owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband Renaldo C., who is 55 years old, works as a tailor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 20 and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Zosima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $188, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock that she can sell to customers so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her business. Ma. Zosima C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

E. is a married woman who lives in Purok Narra, Barangay Tinampaan, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a tailoring business and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Jose, who is 58 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 13 to 28 years old.  \r\n\r\nAdela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $94, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and to put up her own tailoring shop. Adela E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a married woman who lives in Purok 1, Cayhagan, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures. She provides transportation, buys and sells rice, and is also a pump boat operator for fishing.  Her husband Sergio A., who is 47 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 17 to 28 years old, with two of them already working and the youngest child currently going to school.\r\n\r\nFederita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Federita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 27,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $233, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing 30,000 PHP, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her future, her business and her family's needs. Federita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating four business ventures. She sells gasoline, firewood, dried fish, and she also operates a fishing business.  She has no children.  \r\n\r\nEmma joined the Kiva Field Partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $418, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 22,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her businesses.  Emma D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nanca, E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: buying and selling livestock and a general store. Her husband Raymund, who is 49 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 4 children who are 2 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nRuby joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use as funds for her business operations so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Ruby L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. In the photo you will see Ruby together with her sons and a carabao that is ready to be sold.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Common, Brgy. Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and coffee shop businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP8,000. \r\n\r\nLucia is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she could purchase more stocks to sell.  This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lucia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, earns her living by conducting three  ventures: a pig-fattening business, a therapy practice, and a general store. Her husband, Leonardo N., 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  <p>\r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000  to purchase feed and vitamins for the pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future of their family's needs. Thelma N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a community member who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":644352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase feed and vitamins for pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Kabankalan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thelma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1924}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":148.35,"local_amount":6450,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6471.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182593274,"comment":null},{"amount":117.02,"local_amount":5088,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5104.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188729780,"comment":null},{"amount":176.92,"local_amount":7692,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7717.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191467742,"comment":null},{"amount":132.71,"local_amount":5770,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5788.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196030428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T19:09:02Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":250472,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca B., from the village of Rizaluna Cordon, is 58 years old, married and has six grown children.
