However they don\u2019t deny the fact that both of them are excited to, in the future, have their own child and feel the real essence of a family. But, for now they are working so hard to earn money through a business to be financially prepared for having children.\r\n\r\nFidela runs her small sari-sari (variety) store financed by loans she has received from ASHI since her membership in 2006, while her husband earns sporadically as a hired laborer.\r\n\r\nFor Fidela\u2019s dream of renovating their house for a better and safer shelter against storms and any other forms of calamity, she has to grow her business to make it profitable. Then she will be able to put up a savings fund meant for her plan. To make this possible, she therefore would like to request a loan.\r\n\r\nHaving a very good performance as an ASHI member since joining, in terms of attendance to weekly center meetings, loan repayments, and managing a business, she is confident to request a much larger loan.

For this reason, thanks to the loan she will be able to buy a range of materials including 700-inch cedro macho wood, a circular hand saw, and a Truper drill, so that she can increase her production and help herself economically, since she is a single mother and does not have help from her partner. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":563037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Buying wood, a circular hand saw and a drill to increase her production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-07-03T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.9,"local_amount":718.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":766.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771168,"comment":null},{"amount":33.27,"local_amount":665.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":710.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172205062,"comment":null},{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":672.8,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":718.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330750,"comment":null},{"amount":33.79,"local_amount":675.85,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":721.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465907,"comment":null},{"amount":163.4,"local_amount":3267.98,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098039,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-04T01:03:12Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":212116,"name":"Mallana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anthony F., who is holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called Mallana.

Through their daily work, they are building a better future for their children. The bank's meetings take place monthly in the community of Rumichaca. The community is an hour and 20 minutes from Cusco city, traveling along the same route as if you were visiting the Ollantaytambo ruins from Urubamba city. At each meeting, 3 members prepare food for the whole group.\r\n\r\nThe members sell chicha, clothing, eucalyptus trees, handcrafts, groceries, and vegetables. Other members raise small livestock (guinea pigs), or provide services such as bricklaying, carpentry, public transportation, and hospitality.       \r\n\r\nErmita\u00f1a is 45 years old, married, and has 2 children. She was born in the community of Rumichaca and now lives in Pintacha, Urubamba. She tells us: \"In my bank, Cristo Asencion de Rumichaca, there are 11 members.

The live in their own wooden house in the town of Quimbiri, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle. Dina provides for herself since she was 21: she dreamed of having her own shop, but as fate had it, she has dedicated herself to the production and sales of artisanal wood bricks instead. Since she started, this activity has been very profitable, and it has given her many economical satisfactions. She currently sells her bricks in the town of Pichari, which experiences a constant population and economic growth; she has potential buyers there, thanks to the quality of the product she offers and the delivery times she guarantees to her customers. She generally works together with her partner, and they are a good working team, but sometimes she needs more people, and she hires workers to carry out the production more quickly. Her retail outlet is located in her production factory, and for this she hope to have a vehicle of her own, in order to deliver her bricks to the different distribution outlets, and thus succeeding in reducing the delivery time and increase her market share. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she commits to keeping on repaying in a punctual and proficient way; she is also satisfied with her communal bank for the benefits it grants. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy raw materials and components to produce a higher quantity of bricks, hoping to beat the earnings of the previous months.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

P. is 65 years old.  He is married and lives with his wife in the barrio of Santa Rosa.  They have three adult children who are married and independent.  His wife sells fruit, bread, sorbets, and ice.  Jos\u00e9 has worked as a cabinet-maker for over 20 years.  In this way, he supported his family financially and through his hard work, he has paved the way for his children who are now good citizens who work and support their own families.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems he has faced in his business during all these years has been the lack of financing.   The high price of wood, due to the rise in fuel costs, has deterred him from purchasing a larger inventory of raw materials.

has owned a Brazilian clothing store for more than five years. She is well known in the Brazilian community and has a good client base. Her son speaks English very well and has helped her improve her business. He assisted her in working with ACCION USA to get a loan.\r\n\r\nThis will be Joselita\u2019s third loan with ACCION USA. Her previous two loans had an almost perfect repayment history. She qualified for her third loan to buy more inventory for the summer and refinance her previous loan. Her store mainly sells dresses, shirts, jeans, shoes and perfumes. Joselita hopes that during the summer months her sales will increase and she wants to have enough products to meet the demand. Her busiest months have always been during the summer and around the holidays. \r\n\r\nACCION USA\u2019s loans have helped Joselita tremendously in growing her business. Since her first loan in 2007, Joselita has consistently expanded her inventory and clientele. She has always imported most of her products directly from Brazil, which is very appealing to her customers. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

is a 34-year-old taxi driver. He transports local passengers (teachers, tailors, night guards, etc.) from his town to their destinations. He has been in this business for just two months and his biggest business challenge is security since people can pose as clients and turn out to be thieves.\r\n\r\nHe is married and has three children, two boys and a girl who range from 9 months to 9 years old.  In addition to his taxi business, Samuel and his wife generate income by selling repair parts for bicycles.  Before having his car, he had a motorcycle taxi business.\r\n\r\nSamuel plans to use the 70,000 Kenya Shilling loan to purchase car parts to upgrade his new taxi. He has successfully repaid two previous loans of 20,000 and 50,000 Shillings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to have a successful car business and own a large fleet of vehicles so that he can take care of his family and educate all his children.  In five years, he dreams of having a car-rental business with his own fleet of cars.  He is also considering opening a poultry-selling business.\r\n\r\nSamuel describes himself as very hardworking and innovative.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":563365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

Two of her children are now independent and the rest are school-aged.  They live together in their own house in the town of Quimbiri, located on the edge of the Peruvian rainforest.  Mar\u00eda notes that she started her own business, which is a bar\/recreation space that has three tables and eight chairs.  At first, it was difficult because her expenses were greater than her income.  However, with time and thanks to the entrepreneurial strength that characterizes her, Mar\u00eda's business grew slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nToday, Mar\u00eda's business is very well known in her town and she has many regular customers.  The key factor has been the good service she offers, as well as the exotic drinks she serves.  Sometimes, she hosts graduation or birthday parties, or any other type of event, as her establishment is well-designed for these types of parties.  Two young women work for Mar\u00eda, helping to serve the customers with efficiency and effectiveness.  Her schedule is from 10:00 in the morning to 3:00 the next morning.  For this reason, she feels happy with her work, as she has achieved good economic results.  Nevertheless, in time she hopes to open her own clothing store, with the goal of diversifying her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's eighteenth loan with Microfinanzas Peru.

They live together in the town of Quimbiri, located at the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own house made of wood. She has worked for more than 25 years. First she worked in agriculture, tending a small parcel which only served to sustain her family. Now she has a store, which is generating good earnings for her. In this way she has two important incomes for her family. She realizes that to reach what she has achieved, it has taken time, dedication, and much tenacity to her work. For that reason, she tries to keep her store well stocked with products, with the goal that her customers feel satisfied with the products that they purchase.

The group was formed thanks to a resident of the same neighborhood who told the other residents about the EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD organization.\r\n\r\nThe name of the communal bank, \u201cNUEVA ALTERNATIVA\u201d, was the idea of Maria. She decided to propose this name because it has brought her good results in the past. She is the group's treasurer.  \r\n\r\nRosa is the president. She has been in this position for a year in the communal bank and she is very happy with it, since punctuality and honesty are some of her basic principles.   \r\n\r\nRosa is married and has a one year old child. Her business is a small store. The idea for the store came about because the area she lives in is only reently becoming developed and there were no places to shop nearby. She decided to invest in a store and for a short time had a monopoly in the area. She also has a small bookstore in the same locale. Previously, she rented out computers with the internet but it didn't go so well for her and after a time she decided to close her internet booths. She also rents out cell phones as a street vendor, so that the puiblic can make calls and at her house she has a copier with which she offers a copying service.  \r\n\r\nRosa and her husband are paying for the construction of a second floor.

The live in a house they own in San Francisco, a town in the beautiful Cusco countryside.  Santa didn't finish elementary school, but that hasn't been an obstacle for her because she works hard and knows how to overcome the barriers in her way.  She remembers starting with nothing more than a small store, selling cold drinks, and building it bit by bit until she saved enough to add a second floor to her house.  Now she has another house in the town of Quimbiri.  She also earns money from farming and, specifically, from growing cocoa, now her main source of income.  Normally, she tends the crop herself but she hires laborers to help her during the harvest season.  Her partner works as a driver and generates an income that goes to paying the family's bills.  Santa's crop usually sells for a good price at her town's local warehouse.  For the future, she would like to open a motorcycle repair shop because her partner, who studied to be a mechanic, can run it.

The family lives in their own home in the town of San Francisco, located on the ceja (eyebrow) of the Peruvian jungle.  For more than 20 years she has sold the food typical of her country and of the jungle.  Her customers enjoy very much the taste of these dishes.  Some time ago she installed on the second floor of her home pool tables, which became another source of income for her family.  But the work that she most enjoys is food preparation.  She is saving a portion of her income because she thinks of opening a recreation area for tourists; there is a shortage of recreation areas in her town.  She generally works by herself but occasionally is helped by her husband.  Her work day begins at 7am and lasts until 9 at night, from Monday to Sunday, these being the hours that her market site is open.  This is her seventeenth loan from MFP; she is committed to making payment in a timely and responsible manner.  Also, she is satisfied with her communal bank because of the benefits it provides.  She thinks she will invest this loan in the development of a new plot of land that she purchased.  She wants to build an athletic field, which she believes to have great commercial potential.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva

The members are from the city of Temuco (see below **) and dedicate themselves to the sale of various goods such as used clothing, fast food (hot dogs, French fries, and empanadas), charcoal, firewood, dry food goods (like rice and pasta), desserts, metals, recycled goods, and the production and sale of spurs.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group\u2019s treasurer, Jessica, was interviewed for this profile. In the picture she is seated in the first row wearing a white sweater.\r\n<p>\r\nJessica prepares and sells fast food. Her mother, Mar\u00eda Magdalena, who is also part of the bank and is as the group\u2019s president, helps her with this business. They sell by special order and home-delivery.They are currently completing construction of a kiosk in their home from which they will sell the food they prepare.\r\n<p> \r\nJessica and Mar\u00eda Magdalena will invest this loan in potatoes, oil, and materials to finish the interior of the kiosk; if they have extra money left over they will save it and use it to cover the other expenses they may have when they open the kiosk for business, like a display case for the food, \u201cwindow protection\u201d (which refers to iron bars people often put up on the windows of their kiosks to dissuade thieves), and promotion of the business.\r\n<p>\r\nJessica\u2019s goal is to get her water and energy bills paid off, to arrange her teeth, and to treat a back pain provoked by a deviated disk. Her motivations are her two children, who are 12 and 1.\r\n<p>\r\nJessica has enjoyed working with Fondo Esperanza, especially the fact that the bank meetings are a good distraction and allow her to interact with other people which keeps her in good spirits. For Jessica, the loans are a great help and they give her hope to advance her business, as the income from it is her family\u2019s primary support.\r\n<p>\r\n** Temuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 km south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community lives; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":563633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She studied Physiotherapy and works with people of limited resources in the hospitals around the city. \r\n\r\nShe looks after her mother and elderly grandmother; her father abandoned them when Cecilia was three years old. She has been working since she was very young to be able to help her mother, who is sick, and her grandmother, who suffers from rheumatism. Cecilia tries to help her grandmother however she can, because the visits to the specialist, and the medicines she has to take for the pain, are very expensive.\r\n\r\nCecilia is seeking the loan to buy materials for her therapy work. She already runs a clinic at home where she can treat patients, just as she does when she visits them at their homes. She is trying to work as much as possible and maximise her income so she can help as much as she can with the household exprenses. Cecilia is a very responsible, hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to have a surgery where she can help everyone who comes needing physiotherapy treatment. She dreams of offering her mother a better old age, because she is always there for her and gives her moral support as much as economic support. Her mother, Do\u00f1a Delina, says she wants her daughter to have a better future than she had.

She has been dairy farming for 8 years now, and her husband also works in agriculture.\r\n\r\nRosario only finished primary school, because her mother died when she was 2 years old. Being the only girl among a family of brothers she took on the responsibility of bringing up her brothers after the father left them. They had no idea how or where to find him, so Rosario went out to work so that her brothers could get by and could finish their education although she could not. Rosario starts work very early at the dairy, on her own. Morning and evening, she has to milk the cows and take the milk to the vats in Maica. At the same time she looks after her children.\r\n\r\nRosario needs the loan to buy a cow, to increase her milk production and her income. In this way she hopes to provide a better future for her children and her brothers, whom she still has to help out until they finish college. \r\n\r\nRosario is a very responsible and hard-working woman, for which her husband is extremely proud of her. Rosario dreams of a better future for her children. She hopes her daughter will have the opportunity to study for a degree and, with it, be able to help local people.

She lives with her partner and their daughter Anel, who is 8 years old. They live in a place called Quimbiri, where they have their own house, in the beautiful forest around Cuzco. Irma used to work in the town of San Francisco, and after many years of hard work there decided to work full time in her own business, a tourist restaurant, which she set up with her partner. It has become a very profitable business, with many people coming during the week for the incomparable flavour of the exotic dishes she cooks, and so their income has increased slowly but steadily. A typical day for Irma lasts from 9am to 12 midnight, depending on the number of people she has to serve. Her great longing is to grow the business and increase its capacity, so they can receive more tourists. This is her thirteenth loan with MFP; she promises to keep making her payments on time. She also says she is happy with the communal bank, thanks to the good decisions they take.

This extra money allows him to cover his family's food allowance.  Parallel to this work, he owns a store that he runs jointly with his wife, who takes care of the customers.  He wants to expand his store and stock up on various products to stabilize his business.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he is committed to paying his installments on the pre-set dates.

Saging, Brgy. Jonobjonob, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns a living by operating two business ventures: vegetable sales and the operation of a general store. <p>\r\n\r\nMyrna joined Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 4 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her hard work, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan in the amount of PHP 10,000 enabled her to earn a monthly profit of 9,000 PHP, which helped to improve her family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is seeking to borrow a loan in the amount of 12,000 PHP ($275), which she intends to use to buy vegetables and additional inventory for the general store. In turn, she hopes to continue to save up for future home repairs and the betterment of her business. Myrna B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, NWTF is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").  Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 per day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.  They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, which is a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and

There were times when he lost the fruit and when his capital was falling.  For this reason he decided to change businesses and sell his small stand in the market.\r\n\r\nThen he started up a small grocery store, which he has been running now for a year.  \r\n\r\nHis goal is to increase his inventory so that he can have better earnings, since he currently has only a small number of products.

He produces milk, tea, and chickens which he sells locally.\r\n<p>\r\nHis biggest challenge has been tick control which is a major hurdle, especially for certain breeds like friesian, and the fluctuation in the prices of milk which makes it hard to budget.\r\n<p>\r\nChepkwony has requested his second loan from Juhudi Kilimo for KES 60000. This loan will enable him acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. This means more income for the family therefore improving their living standard.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like open a retail shop for him to sell his milk, and to purchase a motorbike to transport his farm products to the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":563791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a

has been farming for the last 10 years on the outskirts of Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya. She has been producing milk, maize, beans and pineapples, all of which she sells to the local market. Her primary challenge in farming has been lack of enough animal feed that affects her milk production, and lack of reliable casual labourers. She is also employed and earns extra income from her retail shop and rental houses in the same area.\n\nEsther is 50 years old. She is married and has three children between the ages of 11 and 19. All her children are attending school.\n\nShe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 45,000 Kenyan shillings to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will improve the standard of living of the family since there will be more disposable income from the sale of milk. In future, she would like to increase the size of her land and plant more dairy feed. She also plans to increase her rental houses and the number of her dairy cows. \n\nEsther is part of a 5 person solidarity group -- when one receives a loan, the others guarantee it.
