Esta actividad la viene realizando desde hace 3 a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, gust\u00e1ndole su trabajo, ya que a pesar de ser cansado el viaje por el r\u00edo tamb\u00eden la desestresa y la ayuda a so\u00f1ar en un futuro mejor, al mismo que conoce otros lugares como caser\u00edos cercanos. Su negocio le es rentable porque su ropa salen como pan caliente, cuando ella llega, todos sus clientes se acercan a observar las prendas que vende eso le da esperanzas de que en un futuro pueda llegar a tener una tienda de ropa. Este es su 4to pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y le gusta mucho trabajar con su banco comunal.

","en":"Elda is 48 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, who help her in every way they can.  The house where they live is their own.  Her business is the sale of second-hand clothes, which she also takes to sell at a hamlet which is two days journey by boat away on the Ucayali river.  It's a very self-sacrificing job because of the long hours spent travelling and transporting her merchandise.  She sells her garments for cash and sometimes by barter, exchanging the clothes for products such as bread, bananas, yuca and maize among other things.  She had been doing this work for the last three years, and enjoys it, because although the journey by river is very tiring, it also de-stresses her and helps her to dream of a better future, as well as passing through other closer hamlets. \r\n\r\nHer business is profitable because her clothes sell like hot cakes!  When she arrives, all her customers approach to observe the garments she is selling, which gives her hopes that in the future she may be able to have a clothes shop.  This is her fourth loan from MFP and she likes working with her community bank very much.  She will invest the money she has asked for in buying second-hand clothes: she also wants to try and sell shoes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":280544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-05T10:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":161.74},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":168.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":178.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":181.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":191.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.87},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":205.32},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":213.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.22,"local_amount":161.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":167.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117222,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":168.42,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:45Z","rounded_local_amount":174.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012133,"comment":null},{"amount":56.54,"local_amount":178.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":185.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595718,"comment":null},{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":181.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":188.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989981,"comment":null},{"amount":60.6,"local_amount":191.38,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":198.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211112,"comment":null},{"amount":63.29,"local_amount":199.87,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":207.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640614,"comment":null},{"amount":65.02,"local_amount":205.32,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":212.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080147,"comment":null},{"amount":67.55,"local_amount":213.28,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":221.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-06T21:48:59Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92652,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aminata  Kand\u00e9, 25 ans est mari\u00e9e avec 01 enfant  en charge.

Makump Bama village is about five miles from Makeni city, the northern provincial headquarters. This school was founded in 1970 by the United Methodist Church to give education to the children of the community and to build up the church. It is the oldest school in the community and one of two schools in Makump Bama village. It currently has a population of 297 pupils and a staff of six teachers.\r\n<p>\r\nMany children from this village and the surrounding villages passed through this school. The school has a proud history; it has produced alumni who are teachers, lawyers, and many other professional workers. Some former students are currently in colleges and universities.\r\n<p>\r\nOne major constraint the school is currently facing is the lack of adequate furniture, especially benches and desks. In 2000\u20132002, rebels made Makump Bama village a base. During their stay in this village, they used all of the school\u2019s furniture as firewood.\r\n<p>\r\nEdward N. J. is the Headmaster of this school. Edward was born sixty years ago in Yoyema village in Moyamba district in southern Sierra Leone.

She saw the need to rely on a second income for their family. At the same time, Daniel spends a great deal of his time manufacturing adobe bricks.

D. M. lives in Lourdes Col\u00f3n, in the La Libertad department, together with her children and husband.  She owns a small business of varied goods, carrying items such as baby products, necklaces, paper goods and \u201cpan dulce\u201d.  Pan dulce is a traditional bread of El Salvador maD. with sugar and, in some cases, jelly.  Margarita wishes to expand her business, which is why she is requesting a loan through which she will be able to purchase many more products for her store.  In this way, she can attract customers from the vicinity of her enterprise.  She does all this with the aim of providing a better standard of living for her children.  She also does it to help her husband pay for the household expenses, since his earnings alone do not cover the family\u2019s needs.  These are the reasons why it is so important to Margarita to improve her business.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

She is the mother of three children--a 19-year-old, a 16-year-old and an eight-year-old. She separated from her husband some time ago, but this is not an obstacle to achieving her personal goals. By selling cheese and meat, she began to acquire some business experience. After a couple of years, she decided to partner with her brother to open a car repair shop. Nancy had saved a bit of capital and her brother contributed his experience in mechanics. Now, they have been selling replacements for three whole years. In order to obtain the funds to send her eldest son to school for electrical mechanics, Nancy did not hesitate to start a new business, this time on her own. A year and a half ago, she set aside a space in her house to open a small shop where she now sells all kinds of groceries. Later on, her goal is to partner with her son in their own mechanic shop to become independent from her brother and progress even further.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":280658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.53,"local_amount":46.2,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084946,"comment":null},{"amount":19.46,"local_amount":17.8,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":19.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978426,"comment":null},{"amount":105.01,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439314,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

That was mainly thanks to her daughters, who advised her that she had already spent too much time doing physically demanding work in people's homes which could lead to long-term health problems. Carmina has supported her business and that of her husband through loans from EDAPROSPO for the past eight months. Both of them have pooled their incomes to cover the expenses of their home and their 14- and 11-year-old daughters. Together, they also make the monthly repayments on their loans. In the future, Carmina would like to expand her store into a mini-mart, specializing in soft drinks, beer and sweets, as these are the products she profits most from, and unlike groceries, they don't spoil.

They have all agreed on making the payments on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":280857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Mototaxi maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-03-07T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermitanio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lyndon Valery","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bacilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6100,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":919.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":956.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":994.69},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1034.48},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1075.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1118.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":282.68},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.98},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.69},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":282.71,"local_amount":919.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T10:31:48Z","rounded_local_amount":925.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27059029,"comment":null},{"amount":293.95,"local_amount":956.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T11:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":962.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35951346,"comment":null},{"amount":0.07,"local_amount":0.23,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":0.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409782,"comment":null},{"amount":623.79,"local_amount":2029.38,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918179,"comment":null},{"amount":330.55,"local_amount":1075.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1082.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139060,"comment":null},{"amount":343.93,"local_amount":1118.9,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1126.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564692,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T23:28:56Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:22:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92825,"name":"Alejandra Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra., Alejandra reside en el barrio Rene Cisneros junto a su esposa e hijos son cuatro de 10, 12,15 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad, que est\u00e1n estudiando, su negocio, tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, su negocio es una pulper\u00eda que administra junto con su esposo, pero tambi\u00e9n palmea tortillas, vende frijoles cosidos, nacatamales y los fines de semana hace sopa, tiene que generar otros ingresos para poder ayudar a sus hijos que sigan con la educaci\u00f3n ya que todo esta caro.

It has been very difficult for Lazaro to support his small family because he only has a basic educational level and can only get temporary work, his jobs have done little to help cover the fixed costs of his son's education.  With the support from his mother, Lazaro decided to open a small store which both of them work in.  Lazaro claims that with the loan he can supply the store.  As can be seen in the photograph, Lazaro's store has very little merchandise, mostly candy which have a very small profit margin, barely $.05 per piece.  Lazaro is requesting a loan to be able to buy merchandise that will allow him to make more visible profit for the growth of his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit,

L. lives in the Santa Tecla neighborhood of La Libertad.  At the young age of 19 Vilma has had to set aside her dream of going to the university because of her family\u2019s economic problems.  Vilma has already finished high school and when she found herself in need of work, she started her own business selling clothing at wholesale and retail prices from her home.  Vilma travels to the western part of the country to purchase merchandise because it is much cheaper there. This way she will be able to offer her customers better prices.  \r\n\r\nVilma\u2019s dream is to open a small store where she can hire someone to help her with her business so she can continue her studies at the university, but, as of now, it is merely a dream because she would need to save a lot of money in order to make such an investment.  For this reason Vilma is applying for a loan to purchase more merchandise and obtain greater profits which will help her achieve her dream of expanding her business and continuing her studies.<br

zinc se le mete dentro de la casa y es como que estuviera en el campo.  Cuando inicio con los creditos en AFODENIC no tenia vivienda, habitaba en la casa de su mam\u00e1, pero a traves de los creditos ha podido construir su propia casa con minimas condiciones, pero esta segura que podra llegar a obtener una vivienda digna para sus hijos que es lo que toda madre desea que sus hijos no anden posando ya que en casa ajena siempre resultan problemas aunque se viva con la familia. Una vez cumplida esta meta continuara con los creditos hasta alcazar su meta deseada.  La profesora trabaja en la zona rural a 14 km de su casa, sale a las 7:00 a.m. en su bicicleta para gastar en transporte y regresa a las 4:00 p.m. debido a que el MINED  les ha obligado que den educacion de adultos en el sector donde trabajan.","en":"Ms. Liliam is single, she is a teacher with 3 children: studying high school, middle school and the youngest is 2 years old. She has been a teacher for 16 years, and is requesting her 8th loan to build a sidewalk around her house, because during the winter the water the falls from the zinc roof gets into the house. When she started the credits with AFODENIC she didn't have a house, she lived with her mom, but thru the credit she has been able to build her own house, with the minimum conditions, but she is sure it will be a good house for her children, so they won't be going from one family home to another. She will continue to request loans until she fulfills this goal. Liliam works in the country 14km away from her house, she leaves at 7am in her bicycle to save on transportation and comes back at 4pm because the MINED requires them to teach adults on the same sector they work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nina Delgado, Kiva

She is 46 years old and married.  She went to school until the 7th grade.  She is the mother of 4 children with ages between 26 and 11, and the youngest 3 are in school.  Lina left Chibuto for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, when she was 14 years old with her oldest brother who was working for the registry office and was transferred to work in that district.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived in Namaacha Lina enrolled in school.  The following year she became pregnant with her boyfriend and had to interrupt her studies because at that time it was prohibited to go to school while pregnant.  She moved in with her boyfriend.  Two years later they married, and he abandoned her 5 days after the wedding emigrating to South Africa and leaving a letter that only was discovered 6 months after alleging that he went to search for work.\r\n\r\nLife became difficult and without knowing what to do she asked for help from her brother who arranged a job for her in the registry office as a servant where she worked for 5 years.  With the money collected she began her own business of selling capulanas [a kind of robe\/dress].  She buys them in Maputo and resells them in Swaziland.  Her business was growing, and she was unable to satisfy the demand of her customers.\r\n\r\nShe discovered our services [Hluvuku] and solicited a loan in the amount of 20,000MT to increase her inventory.  Today her best products are sheets, blankets, duvets, and curtains that she buys for 400MT, 500MT and 350MT, and resells at 1,000MT, 1,250MT, and 3,000MT respectively.  She has had a monthly income of 8,000MT per month and is able to save 3,000MT since she isn't responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan through Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The first two loans were used to purchase products (clothing, sheets, duvets, and blankets).  This time Lina intends to use 20,000MT to the same end and is confident that she will be able to pay it off before maturity so she can request another loan to finish the work on her kitchen.<br

He is 48 years old and married.  He went to school through the 6th grade in the old system. He is the father of 5 children with ages between 6 months and 18 years old.  The 4 oldest kids go to school.\r\n\r\nMario left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, with his oldest brother after having lost their parents.  Having arrived in Namaacha he continued with his studies and completed the 6th grade.  Years later he is employed in the TDM as a service operator of telecommunications.  Today he has been a permanent employee for more than 15 years and earns a salary of 5,500MT working from 7am until 2pm on the morning shift and from 2pm until 10pm on the night shift.\r\n\r\nHe married his wife, and since living together with his brother was no longer agreeable he felt obligated to leave his brother's house and moved into a rental home while he builds his own home.  Since he does not have sufficient funds to finish the work, he approached us and solicited a loan to finish his work.  He is responsible for his sister in law and his brothers who live in Inhambane.  He sends them 1,000MT every 4 months and is unable to save any money while his home is in construction.\r\n\r\nThis is Mario's second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first oan of 8,000MT was used to purchase chickens for resale.  This time Mario intends to use the 20,000MT to purchase construction materials.  Mario and his family live in their own home and he is confident that he can pay off the loan before the maturity date in order to request another loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese

He is 41 years old and is married.  He went to school until the 4th grade in the old system due to the lack of conditions of his parents.  He is the father of 4 children with ages between 7 months and 13 years old.  The 4 oldest kids go to school, and the youngest is a newborn.\r\n\r\nBenedito left Gaza for Maputo alleging that he was going to study.  Having arrived in Maputo he began to work work with his father as a mason.  Years later he moved with his family to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  He started doing local work as a mason, but because his work does not pay very well in Mozambique he emigrated to South Africa.  Today he is in charge, and he works on a contract base.\r\n\r\nOver ten years ago he opened a stand in his home.  Since he works far from home and is not able to satisfy the needs of his family he thought this was the best way to help his wife while he is away.  He has visited his family 3 times in 3 months.\r\n\r\nHis business has a positive impact on the community and he is unable to satisfy the demands of his customers.  He approached hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to increase his inventory.  His best product is beer.  He buys a case for 250 and resells it for 330.  A 25kg sack of rice costs 500 and is resold for 600.  He has had monthly receipts of 3,000MT and is able to save 1,000MT per month.  He is also responsible for his parents who live with him in his house.\r\n\r\nBenedito already had a loan from a bank, and he paid it without difficulty.  This is his first with Hluvuku and with Kiva, which he will use to purchase staple products for resale.  He is confident that he will be able to pay off this loan without problems.

She is the mother of 3 children aged between 11 and 6 and they all go to school.<p>\r\n\r\nAna began her studies quite late in life and when she was in the 6th grade, she fell pregnant and her boyfriend abandoned her claiming that the child she was expecting wasn't his, so she had to interrupt her studies. Her grandmother then gave her some money to start a business and she secretly sold biscuits and pastries at her local market. 2 years later she gets together with her husband who helps her take care of her business. The business began to grow and she slowly built a stall at her home. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007 she managed to complete the construction of the stall but had no capital left to buy merchandise. Through a conversation with her friends she learnt of Hluvuku's services and solicited a loan to buy merchandise. Her best products are sugar, rice, soap and salt which she buys by the kilo for 20 MZN and resells at 25 MZN, by the bag for 500 MZN and resells at 600 MZN and by the box for 200 MZN and resells at 275 MZN, as in the region where she resides they live off more agricultural products.\r\nShe works from 7am to 6pm and has a monthly income of 4,000.00 MZN, of which she manages to save 1,000.00 MZN, as apart from her children, she is also responsible for her grandmother to whom she sends 500 MZN a month.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. Her first loan for 7,000.00 MZN was used to purchase staple goods for resale and she is asking for this second loan of 10,000.00 MZN for the same purpose. She is confident that she will pay off her loan without any problems and will request a new loan to continue building her stall.<p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ines Teles, Kiva

She works as a teacher at the kindergarten of the children village SOS (VESOS) in Sanankoroba. To increase her income, she decided to join the loan credit of Kiva's partner Soro Yiriwaso. After three solidarity loans (group loans) that were repaid without problem, she's seeking her first personal loan.

She's seeking her first loan, following three group loans that were repaid without problems. With this loan, she intends to buy 55 Wax pagnes (colorful African cloth) in Bamako and in Conakry (the capital of Guinea), where she often sends in her daughter to get supplies. The items are sold to the women of the Sanankoroba village, and in Bamako. She sells for cash or on credit, and intends to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 46'000 (ca US$ 90), that she will use to repay the loan, and to invest in her business.\r\n<br

They live in large traditional extended families in the M\u00e9dina Koura district of the city of Koutiala \r\n(Sikasso region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another by neighborhood ties, and they do the same work, primarily making <i>bogolan<\/i> (very pretty mud-cloth that they learned to make from their parents).   Secondarily, they make incense.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy their rich and varied customer base, which increases from day to day, the group members decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their seventh solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe women plan to use this loan to buy sizable quantities of cotton cloth and some ingredients for incense.  Supplies of cloth are gotten from weavers of Koutiala, and the ingredients for incense are purchased from shops selling cosmetics (perfumes and other items).  The lengths of cotton cloths are made into the <i>bogolan<\/i> and then sold retail, as are the incense, in cash transactions at the marketplace and at fairs.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women each hope to realize an average profit of 115,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in their work.  Their ambition is to expand their businesses and to participate in international fairs.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":281751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy cotton cloth and ingredients for incense  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bodo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":324.99,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":169259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033705,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":84629.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621073,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84629.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020038,"comment":null},{"amount":162.51,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84629.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242783,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84629.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678361,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T05:03:25Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92932,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is 30 years old, and she is married with 2 children.

Their ambition is to diversify their business by taking up other revenue-generating activities such as the sale of second-hand bags.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":281756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy second-hand clothing and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Foun\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":134539.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033707,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621075,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020040,"comment":null},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242785,"comment":null},{"amount":129.15,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678365,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T02:56:43Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":92935,"name":"Clara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clara is 56 years old and married with 8 children.

She plans to borrow Php 13,000 as additional capital so that she will be able to set up a livestock (pig) business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes to maintain her village store for sustainability so that, in the future, her children will not experience the hardships of life they\u2019ve been through.  Thus, she is sacrificing a lot to send her children to school to finish their

Ni\u0144o, 2-3 kilometers away from the town proper.\r\n\r\nAfter raising a pig for 4 months, Elvie then butchers the animal and sells the meat in kilos at retail price.  Elvie has observed that her business strategy is good, so she plans to add at least one or two piglets to raise.  To fulfill this, she needs to borrow PHP6,000. \r\n\r\nHer business helps her a lot in sending her children to school and in providing for their needs at home including financial assistance for their farm.  As such, she really wants to maintain the business for sustainability. \r\n\r\nElvie is looking forward for the success of her business in the future and, if that happens, she will no longer have problems in sending her children to school, for there will be enough assistance coming from her business.  \r\n\r\n

The money that they earn is used to finance their children\u2019s education and their family's daily needs including monthly bills of electricity and water.  \r\n\r\nTheir motorcycle transport business is being amortized monthly; thus, their income from its daily operation is just enough.  \r\n\r\nLeonida is looking forward to her request for a loan of PHP5, 000 being granted so they will have money to use for motorcycle maintenance since, at the moment, it always malfunctions due to its needs for some spare parts and repair.  \r\n\r\nTheir motorcycle transport is their only means of satisfying their family's needs; thus, Leonida prays for the financial support to their business.

At present, they live blissfully in Manano, Mallig, Isabela. \r\n\r\nHelen is operating a \u201ctalipapa\u201d, the common name for a vending stall of meat, fish, vegetables and some pieces of fruit.  The business is located in front of their house.  She decided to engage herself in this line of business to support her husband in providing for the needs for their family, especially for their children\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nHelen is earning a net income of 700 pesos per week, which maintains her vending as a major source of income.  To run her business better, Helen wants to borrow a loan amounting to PHP4, 000, which will be used in purchasing other kinds of vegetables that are nutritious and are not easily spoiled.  Helen hopes to set up a business stall in the market.  However, due to lack of financial support, she just patiently operates in their village.

L. is from the village of Sitio Anguapan located in Barangay Sto Ni\u0144o Tumauini, Isabela - a small village where farming is the main source of income for most people.  \r\n\r\nShe is 48 years of age and married to Wilfredo, who is 46 years old and works as a simple farmer in the village.  They are blessed with three children named Jerome -16 years old and in his fourth year of high school, Jolibeth -14 years old and in her third year of high school, and the youngest is Carol - only 3 years old.  Viola is trying her best to send her children to school until college with the simple business she maintains.   \r\n\r\nViola has been raising goats in their village for almost four years already.  She is fond of doing the business since it doesn\u2019t require lots of capital to maintain.  She just brings them to grasslands near their house and cuddles her youngest daughter while they are pasturing. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to avail a loan amounting to PHP4, 000 to help her husband provide for the needs of their family by means of engaging in another business.  She said that it will be of great assistance to her family if her loan is approved, especially for her children who are currently studying.

Because of this, Rubelyn decided to look for a lending program to assist her in the business for her to improve and increase her daily income. She wants to borrow PHP4,000 to fulfill her plans. She is working hard to attain her dream of having a successful business and she believes that through her faith with God, her dream will somehow become a reality because with God, \u201cnothing is

In the village, Amelyn strives for a better livelihood to help her husband earn their daily living and give their children a better education.  \r\n\r\nAmelyn learned to manage a vending business in their village. She entered this business because she wants to help her husband to provide for their needs and uplift their poor living situation. She roams around the village selling her vegetable products. Sometimes, her husband also serves as part-time driver aside from being a helper. Amelyn is frightened of not being able to meet her family\u2019s growing needs because of the unavailability of a stable source of livelihood. This is the reason why she is asking for a loan amounting to PHP4,000 as financial support for her business. She is hoping that her loan will be approved in order to buy different kinds of vegetables in bulk. \r\n\r\n

She will use this loan to purchase different kinds of hair products, including some high-quality hair product lines that she can charge a higher rate per service. Because she does all the salon work herself, Francisca has very little time to spend with her children. Luckily, her salon is in her own house. She dreams of providing a safe home for her children to live in and making her hair salon a modern facility where she can provide all kinds of beauty services. \r\n\r\nJuana V. is the Group 2 coordinator. They are on their second loan cycle with Esperanza International. Juana has two different businesses: selling clothes and selling gasoline. She sells the clothes in her home, and she sells the gasoline on the road close to her house. The community roads are often small and it's hard to find gas stations, so it's easy for her to sell small quantities to the motorcycle drivers. She hopes to expand both businesses in order to provide a better quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza International, thank you for supporting these

Dormaa is an agricultural-dominated town. It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. Gifty sells eggs to make some income to provide for the family. She procures the eggs from the poultry farms in the surrounding villages, and then sells them in a store at the local market square. She sells mostly to retailers. Gifty says she has been in this business for six years. She wants a loan to increase her working capital so she can procure more eggs.

The members of the bank will invest the loan in the purchase of fertilizers and products such as seeds for the new sowing season, before working the soil so the fields can be resown.  Many of them are also merchants: they bring their fruits and vegetables to different places in the region as well as making delicious marmelades from their fruit, without the use of preservatives.  They make 100% natural products.\r\n\r\nThe members value and are grateful for the loan: because they are in the countryside they do not have access to traditional banks.

Currently, Monica is single and is hopeing to get married soon. She trades to make some income to help herself and her younger siblings who are dependent on her. She lives with two younger siblings in a rented apartment in a town called Dormaa Ahenkro in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. Dormaa is an agricultural-dominated town. It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. She says one of her siblings is in the university while the other is in the senior high school. Monica trades in gari and smoked fish. Gari is a local delicacy produced from cassava dough. It can be eaten raw with sugar and roasted groundnut or with cooked beans and oil.

She usually comes to the Capital to buy the appliances. \r\nDorkas dreams of having her own Internet cafe. She thinks it's a great business that has guaranteed clientele thanks to school and college students who would use the internet for research. She also thinks a business like this would allow her to spend more time with her young children and not travel so much for work. She also hopes to make enough profit to be able to go to college. She thinks a better education would allow her to improve her business in a smarter way. \r\nPlease support the initiative of these young women.

D. is 65 years old. She is widowed and the mother of seven children but currently all her children are fully independent. Afua has 8 grandchildren and she takes care of four of them. Her husband died through a prolonged sickness about 9 years ago. She has been very supportive in keeping their home through her current business. She lives with her grandchildren and her youngest child in a rented apartment in a town called Wasa Simpa in the western region of Ghana.\r\n\r\nAfua has traded in coconut oil for 25 years. Coconut oil is produced from coconut fruits. She produces the oil and supplies it to food vendors to prepare their meals. She even treks to the villages to purchase the finished goods elsewhere when demand is very high.\r\n\r\nAfua belongs to a village bank called \"Joy.\" She hopes to receive GH\u00a2400 to make business progress by restocking her inventory.

She lives with her children who are in school. She got divorced due to pressure from the husband's parent. In spite of the challenges she faces, Susana believes in hand work and dedication, which are the secret of her success. She owns and operates a local restaurant where she sells local foods like banku. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains, and it is eaten with hot pepper or soup. She also sells ice water in a sachet form attached to her food joint. Susana realized automatically that after eating, people would need water to quench their thirst. \r\n\r\nSusana needs a loan to enable her to purchase more raw materials like bags of maize, meat, fish, vegetables, and firewood. She says the cost of raw materials is very high now. She also wants to save part of the loan to venture into crop farming in the near future. Susana belongs to the village bank called \u2018Adom Akyede\u2019 meaning the Gift of Grace. She is grateful for your assistance. She hopes to receive GHS1000 to restock her inventory.

Musharraf wants to obtain a new loan in order to purchase spring assortment of dresses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":281866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"For wholesale purchase of spring dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musharraf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2400,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":265.6},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":274.77},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":284.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":294.07},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":304.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":314.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":325.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":336.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.98},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.24},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.93,"local_amount":265.6,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":268.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120804,"comment":null},{"amount":74.41,"local_amount":274.77,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":278.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015915,"comment":null},{"amount":76.98,"local_amount":284.25,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":287.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599648,"comment":null},{"amount":79.64,"local_amount":294.07,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":297.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994087,"comment":null},{"amount":82.4,"local_amount":304.22,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":308.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215363,"comment":null},{"amount":85.24,"local_amount":314.72,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":318.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644859,"comment":null},{"amount":88.18,"local_amount":325.58,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":329.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084455,"comment":null},{"amount":91.22,"local_amount":336.79,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":341,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T06:10:00Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:33:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":93007,"name":"Nana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nana O. is 47 years old.

Teresa has spent more than 30 years running a general store, which enabled her to raise and educate all of her children, as she was widowed 30 years ago. The general store where Teresa works is one of the oldest in her neighborhood, which has brought her many customers. Today, her concern is not her children but rather the grandchildren that live with her. She hopes to give them everything she gave her own children--an education that will enable them to face life independently.

Sara is able to buy used clothing in bulk packages and sell to her neighbors and neighboring communities.

K. just turned 37 not so recently. He and his wife have raised two children. For six years Yusufjon has been involved in manufacturing wooden doors and window frames. Yusufjon\u2019s eldest son helps him with the business. Yusufjon is respected and known in the neighborhood as a real master and this reputation has allowed him to earn a clientele. The business is stable and is generating the main income for the family. Today Yusufjon needs to purchase input materials such as lumber for his business. He is also planning to improve the working conditions of the business. In order to accomplish these tasks he requests a loan of $1100 USD with a term of 12 months. Considering that this is the first loan for Yusufjon he thanks all lenders for supporting and trusting him.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and its manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\n<B>IMON's History<\/B><P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 34 years old. He is married and has 2 children to support and provide an education for. \n\nRavshanjon has been providing tractor services at the local farm since 1999. To earn additional income, he breeds calves, cows, and sheep and sells them at the local market. He has been able to improve his financial situation by wisely using prior loans he received from IMON International to breed his animals. Now his biggest dream is to expand his business by offering dairy products to the community. He would also like to purchase spare parts to repair his tractor.  Ravshanjon is requesting a loan of $1100 USD and is hopeful for your generosity.\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\n\nTajikistan\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":282194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing

She has been selling Oriental style jewelry at the local market for the past 11 years. The national earrings, rings and bracelets she sells are very beautiful and popular in Tajikistan. All Tajik women have at least one set of jewelry, often inherited from their grandmothers. <P>\r\n\r\nGulmira\u2019s jewelry business is successful and generates a stable income for her family.  She started out with $300 USD and now has $3000 USD in working capital.  She requests a loan of $1200 USD to purchase new jewelry and increase the range of items she sells. Gulmira has demonstrated herself as a reliable IMON borrower over the past two years. She thanks all for the support and promises to repay the loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<P> \r\n\r\n<B>Tajikistan<\/B><P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\n<B>IMON's History<\/B><P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":282229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing of

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lochinoy has four children. She is a very honorable and resolute woman. Ever since she was a young girl she has learned the honest work of raising cattle, a knowledge she has passed down to her own children who have also managed to improve their quality of life. Lochinoy and her husband started their livestock business with only one cow. After a number of sacrifices, they were able to increase little by little the quantity of calves. At the moment, with the support of their children, they have started to produce milk. They sell these on the weekends in their village. Lochinoy wants to expand her business and to purchase more cattle.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His business is characterized by stability and consistent growth. He has been working in the market for two years. Once a month he travels to the neighboring city Istaravshan to purchase new goods. Nasrullo likes to work for himself. His business is the main source of income for his whole family. Today Nasrullo would like to ask for a loan of $800 USD for the term of 12 months to purchase new clothing to sell. We believe Nasrullo\u2019s drive for success will help this young entrepreneur succeed and thrive in business. You can be an important part of the growth of Nasrullo\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
