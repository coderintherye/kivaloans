She owns two motorcycle rickshaws, which for five years have been the source of income for her family.  These vehicles are driven by her husband and her son, who transport passengers in them.  Eliana is in charge of managing their daily profits.  What she likes about this business is being able to see their income every day.  Additionally, Eliana sells used clothing, which she takes from house to house to sell in different places in their area.  This is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She likes to work with her communal bank because there is a lot of camaraderie and responsibility to make their payments.

Ta\u00efbatou has been living for about 20 years in the neighbourhood of Gb\u00e9gamey, a densely populated area of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Ta\u00efbatou sells gari (cassava flour) and corn in the same neighbourhood she lives in.  Ta\u00efbatou gets her goods from the interior of the country, specifically in local markets.  Ta\u00efbatou is asking Alid\u00e9 for a loan in order to meet the ever-increasing demands of her customers.  Ta\u00efbatou has already had two loans with Alid\u00e9 which have been repaid.\r\n\r\n\"Alid\u00e9\" means \"there is always a way for the poorest\" in Fon, the native language of Benin.  Benin is a small country in West Africa, next to Nigeria, where the GDP per capita is $1,500.  Alid\u00e9 offers special 0% interest rate loans to the very vulnerable and the organisation is part of a group which will soon launch a micro-health insurance programme to the beneficiaries of micro-loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva

","en":"Moraima is 46 years old, a single mother, and lives with her only daughter who supports her a lot.  Due to her marital separation and in order to support the needs of her daughter, she launched a business selling food, and it has been going well so far.  One of the reasons for her success is that she does not need to rent a location because she has converted her house into a pension, where she offers a daily menu to a group of airline workers since her house is close to the airport.  To add to her income, she sells salchipollos (a dish with chicken and fries) at night.  She has had this business for 10 years and has enjoyed it a lot because she feels useful and above all, she constantly interacts with many people.  In the future, she hopes to have a very nice restaurant where she can welcome many dinner guests.  This is her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP and it has been two years since she found out about the institution and of the communal bank methodology.  In her experience she likes to work with the group because they are active and demonstrate friendship with one another.  She will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of kitchen utensils such as pots, plates, cups, etc. that cost 800 soles.  The rest she will invest in tables and chairs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva

Around her neighborhood her services are in high demand, because she is very good at her work, and obtains good earnings for her household.

The profit will enable her to improve the living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva

They have 3 daughters; Hilda is 21, Margaret is 16, and Pilar is 9.  Pilar is the only daughter that lives with her parents.  It was not easy, and it took great effort, but two years ago Martha started a store.  She had to sacrifice many comforts to do this, but happily the business has been profitable.  Her store is popular because stores are scarce in the area where she lives.  She likes her work because she can take care of her household expenses and be independent.  But it is hard for her to keep the store stocked.  The market is far from her home, and access to her house is very limited.  Even so, Martha puts forth all of her will and effort.  Her daughters are the principal source of support.  Her youngest is especially supportive. With her joy and charisma she attracts and helps lots of customers.  With all of the effort that she puts into her business Martha hopes that her business will grow and become more profitable.  Martha has had several loans with MFP.  This is her first individual loan.  She promises to make her payments on time just as she has done with her community bank.  With the loan she will buy merchandise to stock her store.  She will buy school supplies.  They are much in demand in this part of the school year.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":291285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase the merchandise in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T20:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":225.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":248.51},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":245.8},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":263.84},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":282.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":296.52},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":306.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":320.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":346.8},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":359.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.1},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.49,"local_amount":225.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":228.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012274,"comment":null},{"amount":79.88,"local_amount":248.51,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":251.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595856,"comment":null},{"amount":80.73,"local_amount":251.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":253.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990123,"comment":null},{"amount":83.1,"local_amount":258.48,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":261.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211249,"comment":null},{"amount":87.1,"local_amount":270.98,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":273.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640759,"comment":null},{"amount":90.7,"local_amount":282.19,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":285.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080223,"comment":null},{"amount":95.31,"local_amount":296.52,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":299.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996487,"comment":null},{"amount":98.4,"local_amount":306.13,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":309.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841995,"comment":null},{"amount":437.29,"local_amount":1360.48,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1375.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733764,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Agriculture is also near the zone, primarily the growing of pineapple, yucca, oranges, and beans.\r\n\r\nOdiney is a mother of 4 children.

For this reason, 6 years ago she began a business growing and selling orchids and other varieties of plants. Her oldest daughter helps her with the business.\r\n\r\nThree years ago Odiney had to have an operation on her heart so she couldn\u2019t do the tasks that demanded a lot of physical effort, so she enjoyed taking care of her orchids. She says that seeing the flowers grow, bloom and then to be able to share with others all this beauty is something that fills her with happiness.\r\n\r\nToday Odiney is asking for 600,000 colones loan in order to expand her home, obtain new species of orchids, buy consumables for the reproduction and care of her plants.

Desde muy joven ha venido trabajando en diferentes oficios para mantenerse, pero al conformar su familia, estas labores disminuyeron ya que tener hijos peque\u00f1os hizo que deba dedicarse m\u00e1s a ellos, lo cual le encanta, ya que como dice; educarlos es su mejor labor.

Since she was very young, she has been working in different trades to support herself. But when she had her family, her work diminished as she dedicated herself to her young children, which she loves doing. As she says, educating them is the most rewarding job. Still, she has looked for ways to carry out a job from her home to help with home expenses, entering into the sale of cosmetics, among other professions. \n\nNow she is working in the management of her car, but first she has to repair it to be able to provide a good service. Her husband was using the car to get himself to work because they lived far away, but now his job has been moved closer to their home, and therefore he no longer uses the car. Therefore, they will use the car as a business to transport passengers. Rosario and her husband have great hopes of earning a good profit from the car, as the zone in which they live is difficult to get around and the residents need to get to their centers of work or study. The residents often opt for transportation in three-wheeled motor vehicles, which usually charge a very high price. Rosario and her husband hope to offer their taxi service to transport more people for a lower price, earning a good profit as well as helping their neighbors. \n\nRosario has received various loans with MFP in a communal bank, but this is her first individual loan, and she has always been extremely punctual with her payments. With the money she is requesting, she hopes to make repairs to her car before using it to increase her family income, since her children are growing up and she wants to give them a good education.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Sattin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":291295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repairs to her car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T16:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":172.06},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":178.08},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":181.77},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":195.24},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":202.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":212.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":215.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":226.28},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":241.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":249.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.74},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.41},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":172.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":173.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012276,"comment":null},{"amount":56.99,"local_amount":178.08,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":179.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595858,"comment":null},{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":181.81,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":182.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990125,"comment":null},{"amount":61.01,"local_amount":190.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":191.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211251,"comment":null},{"amount":62.48,"local_amount":195.24,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":196.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640761,"comment":null},{"amount":64.74,"local_amount":202.31,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":203.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080224,"comment":null},{"amount":68.13,"local_amount":212.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":214.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996488,"comment":null},{"amount":69.1,"local_amount":215.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":217.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841996,"comment":null},{"amount":304.32,"local_amount":951.02,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":957.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733765,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She stopped selling clothes  because it kept her too far from contact with her children, who she loves to work with.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow, thanks to her savings, she has a little candy shop close to a very well known school in the district of Anc\u00f3n in Lima.  She often puts on a clown nose in order to attract children, selling her candy with jokes and games, making sure her shop is always full of children at recess time and when school lets out.  She also has another business, which is animation for children's parties, which she primarily does with great joy on the weekends.  Rosario loves children, and for her they are beings full of energy that transmit joy and a thirst for life, unlike adults who are always worried and serious.

In this place, tourists spend weekends at the sea, and are don Juan's most frequent customers.

She is an enterprising woman who sells chickens to a farm house located in the city of Pucallpa, which is a three day river trip. She also buys and sells wood there. For four years, she has been engaging in these business activities and is doing well because the 200 chickens that she takes with her to sell go very fast at a good price (20 Peruvian Nuevos Soles each). She likes her job very much because she knows many riverside places and it is profitable. Later on, Carminia would like to build a shed in order to raise her chickens and stop buying from her suppliers. This is her second loan with MFP and her bank's name is \"Cumbres Mundiales.\" She likes being a member because it is demanding and entails much responsibility among everyone.

She is 20 years old and lives alone in a house that she inherited from her parents. She is a very active participant in her Communal Bank and has a great desire to succeed in life. She owns a small stationers in the center of Juliaca city, selling notebooks, pens, markers, and all kinds of stationary. Currently, she is taking advantage of the fact that the beginning of the school year is approaching for most of the city's schools, and selling all the best kinds of school supplies. For Katerin, the hardest part about her work is always having to know what products will be the most popular so that she can stock them in her store; but she does not truly mind because she really enjoys pleasing her clients. She has been running the store for 4 years now and dreams of seeing it grow until it becomes the best in the neighbourhood - it would increase her income and change her life for the better. This is Katerin's third loan from MFP. She has always been punctual with her payments and expects to be just as punctual this time. With the 2,000 soles that she will receive, she plans to improve her store's set up, so that she can increase the range of goods that she can offer her clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":291485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T01:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katerin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":340.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117315,"comment":null},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":340.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012312,"comment":null},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":340.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595894,"comment":null},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":340.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990161,"comment":null},{"amount":108.19,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":340.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211287,"comment":null},{"amount":108.9,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":342.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640797,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T03:29:33Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96791,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Mart\u00edn H.

At 39 years old, she still has a lot of energy to keep working. She lives with her husband Teodoro, also 39, and her three sons, \u00c1ngel (18), Walter (17), and Alex (3), in the house they managed to acquire through great sacrifice. Gregoria has the most frequented store in the El Carmen neighborhood of Juliaca, and she brings vital and useful groceries to her humble community. She has been in this business close to five years, and what she finds most difficult is having to be in her store all day without being able to leave, since she needs to be there whenever anyone comes to buy something. But she's very happy selling her products and satisfying her customers' needs. In the future, she'd like to expand her shop and have a space with many more products, since her neighborhood is growing. This is Gregoria's third loan with MFP. She paid her other loans punctually and without any problems. She is the most active and involved member of her communal bank, and is well-liked.

Later, she goes to the fields with the laborers and her siblings.  Doing all this work - attending her store and farming - helps her be very happy with life, and now she wants to start her own crops and continue adding to the products she has in her store until is becomes profitable and self-sustaining.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nMardonia is one of the founding clients of this communal bank, and this is the 8th loan she has requested from MFP.  In allt his time, she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments, and is a very efficient Secretary in the group, a position she has held for several consecutive years.  The money she asks for is to stock up her store as well as buy fertilizers for the sweet pea crops.\r\n \r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":291670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Stock up her store and buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T02:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mardonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640816,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1025.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080266,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T03:38:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96876,"name":"Guillermo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guillermo tiene 59 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 3 hijos que trabajan fuera, \u00e9l vive en su casa con su esposa.

When she was a little girl she dreamed of dedicating herself to Andean cooking, but this dream got cut short when she fell in love with a farmer and had a baby.  Since then she and her partner have expanded their work, and she gets up at 5:00 each morning to prepare meals for the farmworkers, and afterwards she joins in the work, which she is very used to.  They primarily grow corn, but lately the price of corn isn't very high and they have lost considerable investments.  This is why they have proposed to grow peas, because right now they are more profitable, and this way they can reverse their current economic course.  Florencia has dreams of buying her own fields, which would be a good investment and in future years she would save the part of her crop that usually goes to pay the landlord.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP, and in all this time she hasn't been delinquent, but she's never wanted to take on any administrative role in her group due to her lack of education.

Now that he's getting older he feels a little nostalgic about never forming his own family, and he often feels that his work is meaningless, and not worth all the sacrifice.  At the same time, he thanks God for giving him a good sister and nieces and nephews that help and support him with his crops.  He grows peas, corn, and a few potatoes in his community's public fields, as well as in some of his own which he has acquired in his years as a farmer.  Felix is happy to work the land because his crops sometimes earn him a lot of money, but there are also bad times in which the low price of his crops means he earns very little.  Like now, with the corn price so low he doesn't bother harvesting it, instead preferring to leave it in the fields so it ages, dries into corncobs, which he later breaks down and sells as dry corn.  This is the only way for him to recover the money he has invested in this crop.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFelix is very happy to be a client of MFP, and has already taken out 8 loans.

A. is 45 years old, married, and a mother of five children. Currently, three are in school. She is very hard-working and resourceful. She sells charcoal in her neighborhood.

Abena obtains her supply of charcoal from the surrounding villages of Mampong and other some parts of the Brong Ahafo region.

They got into this business because their parents worked together.  Now, with the help of their spouses, the members grow a variety of plants, including ayote (also known as pipi\u00e1n, a squash native to Central America), jacote (a tropical fruit also known as Red Mombin or Hog Plum), rice, mangoes and more.  El Progreso sells its products in the Bilas Orientales municipality of Masaya, as well as around the Masaya Market.  With its Kiva loan, the group would like to prepare and sow more land. \r\n\r\nDaniela D. S. O., 38, is the group coordinator.  She has a great sense of humor and a ten year track record of success in this field.  This is her group\u2019s tenth loan with ADIM, and she states that the members have advanced considerably since they began borrowing.

From the 2 pairs of cows raised already yield a calf; this calf was raised for several months thereafter sold to fund the purchase of supplies and generate earnings from the sale of the cow.  Apparently the yield from this lighten significantly Ketut Wardini\u2019s burden.  Besides paying for daily needs it also pays her child\u2019s education, although only a little.  For this second loan, her cows are still producing and healthy.  And the bull she has will always be raised in order to produce many calves until the endeavor develop more successfully.

He is married and has 4 children. He has secondary education. He is a driver by training, but he primarily works in trade. Habibullo owns a grocery store which is located very close to his house. He has been in this business for the past 25 years. His store offers convenience and helps local residents to obtain groceries close to their home without needing to go to the center of the city. Currently, this business is the single source of income for Habibullo's family. For this reason, this loan will significantly help him by giving him the opportunity to increase the inventory. He plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

good gains, since receiving loan from Dinari\/Kiva.  From 2 pairs of cows being raised, would result in bearing calves, one was born.  This calf will be reared for several months after which will be sold in order to buy feed and for gains from selling this calf.  Apparently, revenue from this effort will lighten Deli\u2019s burden substantially.  Apart from paying for the daily needs, it also assists her husband to support the child\u2019s education, although it is only little.  As Deli\u2019s husband is just a farmer.  For this second loan, Deli is even more enthusiastic in this effort.  Deli\u2019s wish, for this second loan, her cow will be healthy and reproduce.  And the mother cow will always be reared to reproduce many more calves, thus this venture will develop to be more successful.

kerja sama tersebut. Anggota sebelumnya berjumlah sebelas orang dan sekarang dua diantaranya berhenti karena merasa sudah cukup mampu dalam mengelola usahanya dengan modal yang dimiliki sendiri. Dalam situasi yang serba sulit saat ini kelompok juga merasakan dampaknya, baik itu dari kenaikan harga pakan maupun harga bibit, sehingga mereka harus berusaha keras mengatur keuangan dalam mengelola usahanya supaya tidak mengalami kerugian. Untuk mempertahankan keuntungan yang mereka peroleh selama ini yang berkisar Rp 600.000 sampai Rp 800.000 dalam waktu enam bulan, mereka mensiasati dengan cara mencari waktu yang tepat saat menjual babi yaitu pada waktu menjelang hari raya keagamaan dimana harga babi biasanya lebih tinggi daripada hari-hari biasa. Dengan cara inilah kelompok mampu mempertahankan kestabilan usaha mereka. \n\tMelihat  dari situasi yang ada pada saat ini dimana tidak semua anggota bisa mandiri menjalankan usaha dengan modal sendiri maka kelompok memutuskan untuk tetap melanjutkan kerja sama dengan Dinari, yaitu dengan mengikuti program ternak babi dengan jangka waktu enam bulan dengan pembayaran dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman, dengan harapan usaha bisa lebih berkembang dan sedikit demi sedikit memupuk modal dari keuntungan yang diperoleh sehingga bisa mandiri pada suatu saat nanti. \n","en":"The Merta Nadi group had already received venture-financing loan from Dinari twice and they derived great benefit from this co-operation.  Previously the members were 11 people and now two among them stopped because felt already able to manage their venture with their own funding.  In this precarious situation, at this moment the group feels the impact, whether from the increase in cost of supplies or cost of piglets, thus requiring stringent changes in managing the venture\u2019s finances so as not to incur losses.  To maintain the profit they already attained till now of fluctuating from Rp.600.000 till Rp.800.000 in the time of 6 months, they strategize with ways to find the precise time to sell the pig that is during the religious festival when the price of pork is usually higher than ordinary day.  With this method the group is able to maintain the stability of their venture.  Viewing the current situation where not all members is independently able to operate venture with their own funding thus the group decided to continue to work with Dinari, that is by following the pig rearing program for a period of 6 months with the repayment occurring at the end of the loan period, with the hope that the venture will develop and gradually nurturing the funding from the gain earned until they become self-sufficient at a later time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":292521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy piglets and feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2009-03-30T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Kongsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Desi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wardani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Arseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh Suci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Sunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suwarti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Sukerti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15600000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":15600000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-18T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15824019.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87026494,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-31T08:38:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-18T09:03:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97014,"name":"Rita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rita K. is currently in the business of selling beer and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

She gets about 20 customers a day; she mainly sells to women and she sells on a retail basis. She started her business selling vegetables but later on, changed to selling necklaces.<P>\r\n\r\nThe main challenge she faces in her business is that since she has to walk, she gets very tired at the end of the day.\r\nShe has worked with MCDT for 4 years and she has received loans for 8 years now. The reason why she chose to work with MCDT is because it was the only institution that could lend her money without collateral. She has worked with her group for one year now.

She is 36 years old and the mother of five children; three of whom are employed in a garment factory while the other two attend a local school. She owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice. She cultivates in the dry season, but faces a problem because her field has infertile soil, which affects crop production. She is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers for the field and fuel for her water pump so she can make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. Sim Thea, is a construction worker who also works to support the family. <P>\r\n\r\n<i>Note:<\/i> Mrs. Sok Chanry, who is a group guarantor, is also presented in the picture with the village bank members.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term (EoT) loans. Nine members have EoT loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

So she decided to ask for a loan to buy them. She would use the rest of the loan to buy corn to boil for selling in the local village. Her husband, Mr. Meach Bit, sells boiled corn in the local village.

Early on, he started earning an income, notably in repairing bicycles that he learned how to do from his uncle.  With ten years of experience, he has perfectly mastered his business.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo improve his enterprise, he decided to include the sale of spare parts.  So he decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his second individual loan.  The preceding loan has been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe intends to use this second loan to buy a major batch of spare parts that are the most in demand when repairing bikes.  Supplies are gotten in Bamako (capital of Mali), and sales are made in Bougouni in his garage, where he repairs bikes.  His customers are composed of bike owners and repairmen.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Mamadou intends to realize a monthly of profit of 50,000 francs CFA that he envisions using to build a house, to expand his enterprise, and to provide for his family.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He is divorced and has two children.  He lives with his younger daughter.  Alfredo\u2019s ex wife took advantage of his good heart. She convinced him to pay for her trip to Argentina to work and make more money.  But the years passed and she forgot about him and their small daughter.  From then on he assumed all of the responsibilities for his daughter\u2019s care and education.  He is very happy that she just turned 14 and now lends him support when necessary.  He is a bricklayer.  Alfredo can now go about his workday without preparing lunch before he leaves.  His daughter has their food ready and taken care of.  But, he is very sad that he is unable to pay for her higher education.  He would like to start a grocery story for her to run.

cuenta con 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado desde hace 20 a\u00f1os y tiene 4 hijos, de los cuales 2 de ellos ya trabajan pero viven en su casa. Desde que se cas\u00f3 aprendi\u00f3 a tejer tapices, frazadas y mantas, y hace 3 a\u00f1os su cu\u00f1ado le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a tejer bonitas mantas de diversos colores y grosores. Desde entonces empez\u00f3 a dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a la elaboraci\u00f3n de esta prenda, ya que es m\u00e1s comercial. Durante el mes de marzo vienen de otras ciudades sus compradores, quienes se dedican a vender este tipo de tejidos a los turistas que visitan sus ciudades durante la semana santa. La idea de Valerio es producir de 5 a 6 docenas y luego viajar a esos lugares para vender a los turistas directamente, pero como sus pedidos se incrementan en esos meses le es imposible realizar el viaje, y cuando quiere tejer durante otros meses cercanos a esta fechas, no puede porque no cuenta con el capital suficiente. Pero, Valerio no se hecha para atr\u00e1s en esta meta y seguir\u00e1 produciendo para aumentar sus ganancias y poder viajar los siguientes a\u00f1os, por el momento seguir\u00e1 tejiendo y su esposa ofreciendo a sus dem\u00e1s clientes. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, acaba de ingresar a su banco comunal, y est\u00e1 muy contento por la bienvenida que le dieron los otros integrantes, asimismo hace compromisos de pagar puntualmente sus cuotas. El dinero que solicita es para proveerse del material necesario, como lanas procesadas y polvos para te\u00f1ir las lanas de los colores que desee.","en":"\r\n\r\nValerio is 40 years old, has been married for 20 years and has 4 children, of which 2 are working but still live in his house. When he married, he learned to make tapestries and blankets and 3 years ago his brother-in-law taught him to make beautiful blankets with diverse colors and with thickness. Since then he started to spend more time making clothing, which is more commercial. During the month of March, his buyers, who sell these types of textiles to tourists during Holy Week, have come from other cities. Valerio's idea is to make 5 or 6 dozen and then travel to sell to the tourists directly, but his orders have increased recently and it is impossible to make the trip. When he wants to make textiles during other months close to holiday dates, he can't because he doesn't have sufficient capital. However, Valerio has not given up this goal and continues to producing in order to increase his earnings and have the ability to make the trip in the coming years. For the time being, he and his wife will continue to make textiles and offer them to other clientes. This is his first loan with MFP (field partner), he just became a member of the community bank, and he is very happy for the welcome that the other members gave him. He ahs also made a commitment to pay his share on time. The money he is asking for is for providing necessary material, such as processed wool and dying powders of the desired colors for the wool. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":292706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"Buying materiales for making blankets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T19:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97130,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christiana sells cosmetics.

Now she is responsible for 2 of the children. Craftmenship is one of the abilities that she got from her parents. When she lived with her first husband,, she prepared the threads so that he could weave with the best speed. Now with her partner, both make textiles. Rosa wakes up at 3am in order to make her textiles and at 5:30am, she works at her other business, a restaurant that she opened 3 months ago. She isn't used to running the restaurant, and what she likes best is to make textiles. However, economic necessity obligates her to make new sources of income, since craftsmanship is only profitable at certain times. To cover the months of low demand, she started selling food. It is just next month, the month of April during Holy Week, that craftsmen make the best earnings. Rosa is the president of her communal bank, in this she is doing well, and she is proving to be a very responsible member with her payments and her functions in the group.

His other siblings all left for Lima to look for a better future, and have proposed that he go with them, but he prefers to stay and work the land, as he refers to agriculture, since he really likes this activity.  Many years ago he only farmed small plots of land (watered by the rain), and his harvests were in the months of April and May.  But he wanted a change from renting land and changed all the seeds according to the type of land.  More than three years have passed and he is finally seeing the fruit of his labor.  Now his crops are harvested two or three times a year, and he believes he has learned the techniques to become a great farmer.  His upcoming goals are to farm on the coast, since he has a large quantity of seeds especially for  that climate.  In this way he will increase his production which will increase his earnings and make his work a very profitable activity.  Last year Nazario was the president of his community bank, and he completed all his tasks very well.  This is his eighth loan with MFP and in all this time he has shown responsibility in his payments.  The money he is asking for is for buying chemical fertilizers for planting his new coastal crops.  \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":292722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T20:43:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":97137,"name":"Mery","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mery cuenta con 42 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja durante 14 a\u00f1os y tiene 7 hijos, viven en la casa que hered\u00f3 en sus padres.
