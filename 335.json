Elmer has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elmer joined HSPFI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elmer is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the first loan taken out by Elmer from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martiza M. is from the town of San Dionicio, MadD., Quirino. She is 51 years old. Martiza is the group leader of a 26-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Martiza M.'s group.\r\n\r\nMartiza is married and has 10 adult children. To make a living, Martiza owns and operates a furniture-making business. The main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Martiza has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 30,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Martiza joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Martiza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This will be the first loan taken out by Martiza from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":465985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mariel joined ASKI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariel is requesting a new loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Mariel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is 02-Dong Hai.\r\n\r\nTinh is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Tinh raises crops.

Tinh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND, which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the ninth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Tinh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

Ton S.

Vista Alegre, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 43 years old. Rosalinda is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalinda is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise & sell in the future. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":464776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase livestock feed & other supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.Vista Alegre,Bayombong,Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T09:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Willy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

She is 23 years old. Reynalyn is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nReynalyn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Reynalyn owns & operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Reynalyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Reynalyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Reynalyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Reynalyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":467395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Norma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Norma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Norma is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This loan will be the ninth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Melita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Melita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Melita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will also be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Melita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Agpawa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ernylita A. is from the village of Brgy.Nalubbunan, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 32 years old. Ernylita is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErnylita is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Ernylita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ernylita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ernylita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ernylita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ernylita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Ernylita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":464802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A. is from the town of Gud, San Isidro. He is 29 years old. Rodolfo is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Rodolfo owns and operates a business venture in the services sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from motorcycle transport. Rodolfo has been engaged in his business for over 4 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodolfo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodolfo is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used in the maintenance of his passenger motorcycle. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rodolfo from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMercedes is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Mercedes raises pigs to sell. Mercedes has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $110 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mercedes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Mercedes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Mercedes is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 6th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Maxima has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Maxima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maxima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from ASKI. Maxima is requesting a new loan of 17000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Maxima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ms. S. has been active in this trade for about ten years.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Ngaye Djit\u00e9, who sells fancy shoes for women;  Aida S., who has a small breakfast stand; Maguette K. who sells perfumes; and Adama S. who travels to Gambia to buy fabrics for re-sale in Thies.\r\n\r\nEach group member receives 100,000 FCFA to finance their activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSope Serigne Babacar S. is an association of female commercantes (vendors) working in Thies, a city about seventy kilometers from Dakar.\r\n\r\nThe association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. Their aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.\r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC (Union of Institution Mutualiste Communautaire d\u2019Epargne et de Credit). Groups of five are financed through ten-month loans of which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are fourteen groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar S. is headed by Ms. Coumba Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":466143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To use as additional capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T15:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bator","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maguette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168533,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007495,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036567,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759125,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790639,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971078,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708342,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-22T09:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922413,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188916,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-12T14:56:06Z","paid_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167560,"name":"Benta Atieno","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benta Atieno M. started her current clothes-hawking business (selling door-to-door) in 1993 before which she was a retail shop owner.

She lives with her little daughter, who is eight years old and goes to school. They live in the town of Opico in the department of La Libertad. She has a bakery in which she makes and sells the bread. It is baked in an artisanal oven made from brick and cement. This business is what allows her to support herself and her daughter as well as give her everything she needs for a dignified life. Sara is asking for a loan with which she will be able to repair the roof in the place where the oven is located. She does not have the money to be able to repair it. It is urgent, because in the rainy season it becomes completely uncomfortable, since the oven gets wet and this impedes her from making bread while it rains. This slows down the bread orders. Sara is a woman who works a lot for her daughter, since she is a single mother. This makes her double her efforts for the wellbeing of her little girl.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

Her three businesses let her earn a total net profit 16,500 Philippine pesos per month.  \n\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 19,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business and she will buy assorted clothes for her ready-to-wear business.\n\nShe dreams that she can have her own property to establish her business and prays that all her children will finish their studies someday and have a better life. \n\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Nay S. is 42 years old. She has three children, two of whom are studying at the public local school while the other helps with housework. Her husband, Mr. Lort Bon, is a farmer. They all live in Pongro village in the Takeo province. \r\n\r\nMrs. Nay S. is a duck breeder.

They live in a three room house in Alabukam, a district in the Bamenda-NW region of Cameroon. Anna has decided to work extra hard to assist her husband in providing for such a large family. She has faced many challenges in life such as inadequate funds to sustain her business project and ill health. These challenges made life uncomfortable for her, until September 18th, 2008, when she discovered GHAPE and became a member. In that same year, Anna received her first loan of 40,000 XAF and her repayment was successful. The profit she made was reinvested in her business capital for buying and selling.\r\n<p>\r\n With this loan of 150,000 XAF, Anna plans to buy firewood, dry corn and groundnuts, corn, koki beans, salt and magi and pay some transportation costs. Anna will start repayment from the third month after disbursement.  She is quite convinced the business will succeed because of her approach to her customers, the way she displays her goods and the experience she already has in the business. Her business will help her locality in that the taxes she will be paying will help to foster its economic growth. With the profit from the business, Anna plans to pay her children's school fees and expand her business. She prefers to receive loans from GHAPE because of the social education GHAPE offers and its convenient method of repayment.\r\n <p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":467549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, beans, groundnuts and other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

For several years she has been a clothing peddler in the Oriental market.  She is one of the most popular sellers because she sells at reasonable prices.  Her earnings go to pay for household expenses like: water. electricity, educational fees; she is able to help her husband because his salary is low and not sufficient to meet all their needs.  Thanks to God, she owns her house which little by little she has been improving.  During her loan cycles with Afodenic she has invested in underwear, t-shirts, caps, etc.  With this new loan she will buy a variety of underwear for children and adults because it is a good seller due to its low price and its widespread need.  This month she will buy socks and athletic shirts to sell to students.  In the future she hopes to continue improving her sales as well as having a fixed locale because now, she sells walking through the market.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":468209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-12T19:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aditza Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.6,"local_amount":811.96,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":832.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841570,"comment":null},{"amount":40.2,"local_amount":804.08,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":824.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874494,"comment":null},{"amount":40.15,"local_amount":802.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":822.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604365,"comment":null},{"amount":40.06,"local_amount":801.26,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":821.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639835,"comment":null},{"amount":38.99,"local_amount":779.78,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":799.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821614,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-12T21:50:54Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":167810,"name":"Melva Aidee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Melva es otra de las socias del Banco Comunal Mujeres Solidarias en la ciudad de Portoviejo, ya son 11 ciclos los que lleva en la Fundaci\u00f3n, vive con su  hijo  ya que se separo de su esposo  y es \u00e9l quien la acompa\u00f1a  en casa y en su negocio.\n\nElla se dedica a la venta de mariscos desde hace cinco a\u00f1os,  recorre junto a su hijo en una moto para comprar por libras  la pesca  a los mayoristas en el  balneario de Crucita  a  media hora de la ciudad de Portoviejo, invierte un aproximado de 200 d\u00f3lares en cada adquisici\u00f3n de igual manera  salen todos los d\u00edas a vender y calcula que diario le quedan libre de ganancias 40 d\u00f3lares;  con este nuevo pr\u00e9stamo solicitado Melva comprar\u00e1 pescado que se vende m\u00e1s en \u00e9sta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o y  tener un suficiente stock para sus clientes. \n\nUno de sus sue\u00f1os es  poder tener su casa propia\n","en":"\r\nMelva is another member of the Mujeres Solidarias communal bank, which is in its 11th loan cycle with the Fundaci\u00f3n.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarivic is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Marivic owns & operates a business planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Marivic has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marivic joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Marivic from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Medy plants and harvests a variety of vegetables to sell. Medy has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately $66 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Medy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Medy is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use any additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for her rug-making business.  She is able to earn a profit of about $275 a month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a 12,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business for buying raw materials like strips of cloth, crayons and sewing thread.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that through this added capital, her monthly profit will also increase. She prays that someday they will have their own home and that her children will graduate from college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she has been able to borrow 11 times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative.

Her business lets her earn a net profit of PHP 8,800 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 17,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital by buying assorted grocery items for her expanding business. \r\n\r\nShe prays for good health so that she will have the energy to manage her developing business.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

R. is from the village of Santa Isabel.

Anita has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>Anita joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.
