She lives in her own home with her husband Marcel, 55 years old, and their 6 children who support her and give her the strength to keep going.\r\nSixta rises early each day to prepare her family's breakfast and later sends them off to their respective fields to work, growing cocoa and coffee plants. Sometimes they have to do the maintenance work, such as fertilising or eliminating the weeds that invade the plantations. These days she does not have to do too much of the work because her children help her with it all. She tells us that she has been working on farms for 45 years and she has learned enough to be able to sew, harvest and produce cocoa and coffee plants.\r\nHer greatest wish is to acquire more land for growing so that her family will have a better standard of living. This will be her 7th loan with MFP: she is aware that she has to be punctual with her repayments so that she might have the chance to borrow again. She is a responsible and trustworthy member of her communal bank.

Right now, she lives in her parents' home together with her partner, 25-year-old Richman.  Jimena inherited a hectare of farmland from her parents so that she could grow some crops which is what she most enjoys doing.  Together with her partner, she managed to sow cacao plants.

Their difficulty lies in the fact that they cannot make progress in laying the foundations for their home because their harvests are seasonal.

He is an independent young man who lives alone in a rental house in San Ram\u00f3n district, in Chanchamayo province.  Two years ago he decided to start living alone because of problems that he was experiencing living alongside his mother's new partner.  Since then he has been working hard to pay the rent on his room and pay for his daily food.  Thanks to the progress he has made, he has been able to buy a motorcycle taxi with which he works every day, providing a transport service in his town.  \"It is profitable because I work from early in the morning and, if I want to earn more, I work until very late at night.  It depends on the individual,\" he says.\r\n\r\nHowever, Juan is intelligent.  He knows that this is what he wants to do.  He sometimes does contract work in the mines and leaves San Ram\u00f3n for something like three months.  However, every time he returns he continues working with his motorcycle taxi.\r\n\r\nJuan is saving up to buy a plot of land so that he can build his own home in the future.  He is an exemplary young man as he also has a great desire to participate in his community bank, working as a team.  This is the first time that Juan has requested a loan from MFP.

Since she separated from her son's father, Virginia has been able to make progress in any business activity that provides her with enough money to cover her expenses.  She rented a house and set up a grocery store there, selling basic household products and food.  Her neighbors already know her and visit her business every time they need something.  She has been in this business for four years and it is doing well.  However, it is not enough for her.  Every Saturday and Sunday, Virginia sells food such as 'patasca' or 'mondongo' (a concentrated stew made from meat and sheep or cow offal), and chicken soup.  Her seasoning is unmistakable and requested by her customers.  This is why her business has been well received.  Her charm and affection are her main ingredients.  Brayan helps Virginia to serve in her small store and he is both her company and her reason for working.

Doing her calculations, Dalia earns around 2,500 soles a month whenever her work is coordinated and constant.\r\n\r\nDalia says that in order to make 4 ladles, she uses one foot of wood which costs her 1 sol and 50 centimes.  She sells each ladle for 1 sol and 20 centimes.  She gets 15,000 ladles from 3,000 feet of wood.  Her profits are considerable if she sells wholesale.\r\n\r\nDalia's goals are clear and ambitious.  She plans to open her market toward Tacna and, with a bit of luck, she will start exporting to Chile.  It will depend on how she channels her contacts in the neighboring country.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Dalia has requested a loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in making her monthly repayments.  She is happy to belong to her community bank (Puente Centenario) because she knows that it will enable her to reach her goals more quickly.  She will invest her money in buying \"Diablo Fuerte\" wood and will visit the farms to do this.  She will acquire 1,000 feet of wood so that she can continue in her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":84.46,"image":{"id":1002333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy 1,000 feet of wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T22:50:07Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":220.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":232.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":240.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":255.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":267.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":283.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":220.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":226.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386494,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T17:33:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390195,"name":"5 De Mayo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las nuevas integrantes son la se\u00f1ora Maria Manuela va a comprar con su prestamo maiz, la se\u00f1ora Virginia va a comprar cerdos y alimento para engordarlos, la se\u00f1ora Eva va a comprar carne, tortillas, verduras, nopales para elaborar taquitos.

She currently offers three different flavors that are made from her all natural, garden-fresh ingredients. Yolanda goes further in insuring a quality product by packaging it in light-weight PET jars that are easily recycled or reused, rather than bulky and breakable glass jars. For some time she has used her own kitchen to produce her sauce, however, recently she has been given the opportunity to use a commercial kitchen through a local business incubator. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yolanda operates without any employees and still maintains a full-time job at EmblemHealth.

She lives in a rented room with her small daughters because this is not her native city.  Previously she lived in the city of Ayacucho but for various reasons decided to move to the coast of Peru, to Ica.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth was abandoned by her partner, she became very strong and decided to get ahead with her little ones.  This is why she has worked for two years selling gelatins in the street, only in the summer season, and when we are in winter, she works selling cakes.\r\n\r\nElizabeth tells us that she is very well at the side of her little girls.  She always feels that they are the ones that give her the strength necessary to continue fighting.  This story is about a strong woman, always dedicated to succeeding.

Chincha is renowned for the culture of the Chinchas which is well-known for its advanced knowledge of agriculture and its prowess in seafaring. Today Chincha is an amazing mix of cultures, with a large African-Peruvian population due to its indigenous past and the influence of the Spanish Empire. The city, along with other cities of the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007 by strong earthquakes, but it recovered as it always did for much of its history.\r\n\r\nBlanca is a hard-working woman and when she has a moment of leisure, she enjoys watching television, in particular her favorite soap operas. It is well known that Peru has the most delicious food in the world. One of Blanca's favorite dishes is \"<a href=http:\/\/wiki.sumaqperu.com\/es\/images\/5\/53\/Sopa_seca_con_carapulcra.jpg target=\"_new\">Carapulcra con sopa seca<\/a>\", a typical dish of southern Peru, made from pork, groundnuts, potatoes, noodles and chicken.\r\n\r\nBlanca sells shoes. She attends her store around 9 hours a day and can serve up to 12 customers each day.

I chose to pursue my dream career at Strathmore because it is the best university that offers business courses and is recognized worldwide for excellent performance in ACCA.\r\n\r\nI am applying for a loan to enable me to purchase a laptop. Acquiring a laptop will be instrumental in pursuing the two courses. The degree course involves a lot of individual and group projects that contribute to my final marks. The laptop will help save the costs incurred in printing the course material and past papers for revision purposes. It will also help me in my programming classes as part and parcel of the coursework.\r\n\r\nI would like to be a prominent business lady as well as the best accountant and financial analyst. I would like to be a role model for my siblings and to others who look up to me. With my education, I hope to help other needy people, especially children, and also help transform Kenya into a better place to live.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1003543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Indeed, her intention is to expand her business by opening two additional sales stands and increasing her production volume.\r\n\r\nHer long-term ambition is to open a pastry shop and tea salon, where she will be able to employ two young workers to help with the cooking and selling."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":95.08,"image":{"id":1003680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To expand her stocks of flour, buy 50 kg of sugar, trays of eggs, and flavourings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T09:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T09:50:08Z","loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22900},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":23200},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23400},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":23700},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":24200},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":24500},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24800},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25100},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25400},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25700},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":26000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26300},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":26400},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27000},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":27400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.08,"local_amount":46100,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":47021.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357167,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T15:41:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389135,"name":"Nimraz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nimraz, 21 years old and a single lady, is the oldest among her  brothers and sisters.\n\nNimraz is a second-year student majoring in accounting in a university in Jordan.

This area is known for its rich, pre-colonial culture and its handicrafts which are well known both at home and abroad.  It is home to the famous Panama hat.\r\n\r\nThis group decided to get together three loan cycles ago and form a loan group.  It has been very useful to them as they have used their loans to improve their small businesses and their lives in general.  The members are engaged in different business activities including animal raising, general commerce and other activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Rosa who is 51 years old and married.  She had nine children from her marriage but two of them died.  Her youngest child is 16 years old and in school.  He still lives with her.  Her husband doesn't work for health reasons.\r\n\r\nRosa sells all kinds of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door and also sells from home where some of her customers come to buy.  She works every day, for two or three hours a day.  On weekends she works all day because on those days, in addition to selling, she also collects payment for goods she has left on credit.  She buys her merchandise in Manta or Guayaquil.  She has a lot of customers as she has been in this business for some years.\r\n\r\nRosa will use this loan to buy seasonal clothing such as swimsuits, shorts, t-shirts, blouses etc. as she has several orders.  This is her third loan through her community bank.

She would like to buy nutritionally-balanced feed which she will use to fatten her animals.  She will also buy ingredients for making more 'chicha de jora'.  Cristina has requested a loan for 700 soles from Edpyme Alternativa which will help her to make more income.  This will enable her to improve her quality of life and also repay her loan.\r\n\r\nCristina has been an entrepreneurial woman since she was very young thanks to the values that her parents instilled in her.  These values are now recognized by her neighbors who have a great deal of admiration for her because she is always looking out for her family's well-being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1002948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy nutritionally-balanced animal feed and supplies for producing 'chicha de jora'","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T18:39:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391827,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is 43 years old.

The vehicle which Eduardo uses for his work is hired from a family member to whom he gives a fixed sum every day.  Eduardo has been in this business for three years and has saved up 65% of the value of a new vehicle.

Sadly, she also lost one of her children who left behind three orphans.  Magda raises them as if they were her own children.  They live together in their own home where Magda teaches them good habits every day\r\n\r\nEvery day Magda goes out to the market very early in the morning.  She goes looking for used clothing which she buys by the bundle and wholesale.  Once she has her products, she catches a vehicle or a boat, depending on where she is headed, and travels to the towns, farms or villages to offer her products for sale.  She sometimes exchanges her products for animals which she then takes back to sell in the city.  She has been in this business for 30 years and it has allowed her to raise and educate her children.  Her work is going very well as she always works as hard as she is able so that she can make enough income to meet her household's financial obligations.  In the future, Magda would like to have a grocery store in her home as she doesn't really enjoy having to travel because it is very heavy going.\r\n\r\nThis will be Magda's eighth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.  Magda will use the 800 soles that she has requested to buy more used and new clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":45.96,"image":{"id":1003001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy used and new clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":135.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":143.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":146.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":122.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":123.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386508,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T19:52:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391806,"name":"Myasar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myasar is a conservative person so she is unwilling to upload her picture on the internet.

She likes what she does because she is independent.  She has her own schedule, and it gives her the opportunity to give other people work.  She hires them when she has too many orders, and she cannot fill them alone.\r\n\r\nShe is very reminiscent of when she started.  She worked for another person, and she was looking to become independent.  From then on she has gotten improved income.  She hopes to continue with her work and to later have a larger shop with more machines and more workers.\r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP.  She therefore hopes for you collaboration in order to continue with her objectives.  She is committed to the members who comprise the communal bank that she belongs to.  Also, she is convinced that she will be a good client who is punctual and responsible with her payments.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy materials to continue with her business.  She will also buy some tools that she needs to do good quality work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":115.81,"image":{"id":1003009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy materials like thread, fabric and sewing tools to facilitate her work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":308.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":317.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":316.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":341.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":354.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":361.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.81},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.81,"local_amount":308.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":311.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386509,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T00:28:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390578,"name":"Katherine Nina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Katherine  continua con su negocio de compra y venta de artesan\u00eda, ella sigue alquilando el mismo local y esta ahorrando para poder tener su propio local, la socia desea invertir en la compra de arte, y de ceramicas, de chullos, mantas, shalws, de lana de alpaca y de oveja.

She is married to 61-year-old William and the couple have six children who are already grown up and live independently.  Milena lives in her own home together with her husband.  They both work hard as they would like to be able to save up enough to enjoy a peaceful old age.  Milena always knew that she would have to work hard to enjoy a comfortable life.  For this reason, she started working 20 years ago when she opened her small but very well-stocked grocery store.  Over time, she expanded her business and decided to start selling gas canisters because there wasn't a business of this type in her area.  This allowed her to make good profits.  Later on, she also opened a tire repair shop.  This is a business that she carries out with the help of her husband.  Her husband does the work while she runs the business.  It is doing very well as they enjoy good sales and have a lot of customers.  Milena knows that everything she has achieved has been the result of her effort and a lot of sacrifice.  She hopes to continue making progress as she has many goals to achieve in her future and she doesn't plan to stop working.\r\n\r\nThis will be Milena's 14th loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support because this will make her feel more secure in making progress in her business.  For her part, she pledges once more to make her loan repayments in a punctual manner so that she doesn't let her group down.

They have three children, ages 21 and 19. She and her family live together in their own house, in the San Carlos neighborhood in Chanchamayo district. Eugenia is a tireless and strong-willed woman.  \r\n\r\nShe has been farming for 20 years, and grows fruit. She has twelve plots of crop land, where she grows coffee and bananas. She is aware that the work is very hard, and requires a great deal of dedication and investment, but she likes the work, because everything she gets is the product of her efforts. \r\n\r\nThe coffee provides her with annual income, and in the meantime, she pays for her daily expenses by growing bananas. \"I harvest 30 crates of bananas every week. I sell each one for ten soles,\" she says. She gets 200 sacks of coffee from her coffee plantation, and each one of them is 60 kilos. This way she gets from 600 to 800 soles for each sack, depending on the seasonal price.\r\n\r\nHer husband and older children help her with the work, but when there is more work to do, she resorts to hiring laborers. She wishes to expand her coffee plantings, and for that she will buy other plots of land outside the city.\r\n\r\nThis would be the first time that Eugenia would get a loan from MFP. That is why she pledges to make her installment payments on time. She feels excited to belong to the \"San Carlos\" communal bank. When she receives the money, she will use it to buy several sacks of organic fertilizer for seven parcels of coffee-growing land.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.11,"image":{"id":1002318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T19:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T19:40:10Z","loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":93.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":109.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":113.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":123.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":143.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":149.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":93.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386490,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T02:38:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390152,"name":"Diomedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Di\u00f3medes de 31 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado con Elva tiene 2 hijos: uno de 12 a\u00f1os y el \u00faltimo de 6 meses de nacido.
