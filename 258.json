The purpose of the financing is for working capital for the purchase of bags, footwear, and clothing.  His wish is to establish a shop in order to exhibit his products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

In the past he considered getting married, but it was impossible because of the cost of a wedding. He currently lives in his own house with his partner and their children. So that he can have a comfortable life, he works every day in his potato and pea fields. However, what he most likes to grow is maize as he sells the corn in 60-kilo bags for 50 soles. If the price drops, he doesn\u2019t sell the corn this way, but lets it dry, removes the kernels, and sells them by arrobas (1 arroba = 12 kg) for 23 to 25 soles. \r\n\r\nHis wife is his right hand in this work since she is a very skilled businesswoman. Every Wednesday and Saturday she takes a bag of corn to the market where the sellers are waiting for her. His wife happily does the selling, and he helps her. Once the sales are made, the two of them buy their supplies for the week and set off cheerfully for home. When they get to their house, Hugo again resumes working hard in his fields in order to fulfill his dream of a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is Hugo\u2019s 5th loan with Kiva partner MFP. His four previous ones were paid back punctually, and he promises to do the same this time as he is very happy to belong to his community bank. The money will be used to buy fertilizer for his corn and pea fields. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":368876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T00:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959581,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-18T22:36:10Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128682,"name":"Candelaria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Candelaria pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cSanta Cruz de Bellavista\u201d  que esta ubicado en el distrito de Puno, Provincia de Puno, Departamento de Puno, ella tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil casada, y es madre de 04 hijos.

She is a very quiet and hard-working lady who has worked in agriculture since a very young age. Now that she is a mother, she has learned to organize her time and take care both of her home and her farm. \r\n<p>\r\nAs Nora works with her husband, they finish early and she has enough time left to work on her neighbors' farms, where she usually turns over the earth and harvests peas. She earns 13 nuevos soles (US$4.40) a day for this work, but she prefers to be paid depending on the amount of harvested peas, as this motivates her to pick as many peas as possible. When she has to harvest her own crop, she gets up at 3 a.m. to prepare the meals and then pick peas. In the afternoon of the same day, she sells her peas at the city market where she can usually get a good price for them. This makes her very happy and motivates her for a new sowing cycle.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She repaid her previous loans without difficulty and promised to do so also this time. In the meetings with her Communal Bank she patiently explains to her group members any topic which they might not fully understand, and they are grateful for this. Nora will use her loan to buy chemical fertilizers for her next crop of potatoes and peas.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva

La siembra y el cuidado de sus cultivos es su mayor placer, ya que desde ni\u00f1o su padre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a tenerle gratitud a Dios y a la tierra. Al ver fructificar sus plantas se regocija mucho, puesto que cuando coseche tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de comercializar sus productos directamente en un mercado importante de la ciudad de Lima. La decisi\u00f3n de enviar sus cosechas a la capital es porque le genera mejores ganancias y ello le da la oportunidad de pagar el alquiler de la chacra y la compra de fungicidas en aras de prevenir el acecho de las plagas. De terminar sus labores agr\u00edcolas, Viviano busca trabajar en las chacras de sus vecinos, para de ese modo cubrir los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n diaria de su casa, ya que por ello le pagan 15 soles al d\u00eda y a su esposa 12 soles. Por el momento, Viviano seguir\u00e1 trabajando arduamente para el bienestar de sus hijos. Este es su quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, durante los ciclos anteriores demostr\u00f3 ser una persona muy puntal en cada uno de su pagos, por lo que todos los integrantes de su banco comunal lo reconocen; asimismo, menciona sentirse muy bien con todos ellos. El dinero que ahora solicita lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para abonar sus chacras de arvejas, donde posa para la foto. ","en":"Vivian is a very thoughtful man dedicated to agriculture.  He is 36 years old and has just finished building his own house where he lives with his partner and mother of his two children.  The planting and care of his crops is his biggest pleasure because, ever since he was a child, his father taught him to give thanks to God and to the earth.  Upon seeing his plants bear fruit he rejoices, as when he brings in the harvest he will have the opportunity to sell his products directly to an important market in the city of Lima.  He sends his harvest to the capital because this generates the best income and gives him the ability to pay the rent for the farm and buy fungicides in order to ward off plagues.  Upon completion of his own agricultural labors, Viviano looks for work on his neighbors\u2019 farms.  With the 15 soles a day they pay him, and the 12 soles a day they pay his wife, he is able to cover the household\u2019s daily costs of food.  For the moment, Viviano will continue to work arduously for the wellbeing of his children.  This is his fifth loan with MFP.  In the previous series, he demonstrated he was prompt in every one of his payments.  All the members of his communal bank recognize him and, in the same manner, he feels good with each of them.  With the money that he is currently requesting, he is planning to invest in the purchase of chemical fertilizers to improve his pea fields, where he is posing for the photo. <br

Por ello, se dedica \u00edntegramente a su chacra desde 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa, ya que poco a poco vienen creciendo en sus siembras, donde esta temporada lograron sembrar dos bolsas de arvejas y eso lo llena de mucha satisfacci\u00f3n. Asimismo, para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o se est\u00e1 proponiendo a sembrar el doble de papas, es decir 10 sacos de semilla, ya que en esta temporada en el mercado de la ciudad de Tarma le cotizaron a buen precio y eso le permiti\u00f3 acumular ganancias que invirti\u00f3 en otra siembra de arvejas.

El pr\u00e9stamo que viene solicitando es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para su nueva siembra de papas y el abonado de sus arvejas. ","en":"Wilfredo is 39 years old and happily married.  He has a good character and above all, is very responsible for his four children, who all live with him in their house.  Wilfredo's greatest concern is to give his children a very comfortable standard of living and set them on the path to good careers.  To do that, he goes to work in his fields every day from 8 am to 6 pm, with his wife by his side.  Little by little, they are expanding their crops.  This season they managed to plant two bags of peas, and that filled them with much satisfaction.  For next year, Wilfredo is planning to plant twice as many potatoes, which would be 10 sacks of seed, because potatoes earned a good price this season at Tarma's market and this would permit him to earn profits that he could invest in another crop of peas.  \r\n\r\nIn his photo, Wilfredo proudly shows us his pea pods, which will be harvested in a few days.  Wilfredo is very dependent on the market, and he hopes that prices will go up so he can earn greater profits.  \r\n\r\nThis is Wilfredo's fifth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  This season, he has demonstrated that he is a very responsible client, not just in making his payments on time, but also in the organization of his communal bank, which he really enjoys being a part of.  The loan  that he is requesting is for the purchase of chemical fertilizers for his new crop of potatoes and his next planting of peas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Leah Karlins, Kiva

","en":"Manuel is 54 years old and lives with his wife in their own home.  They have 6 children and also a 7 year old grandson.  Manuel is known to be a man of good character and an industrious worker.  He has been farming since he was a boy by helping his parents on their property, but when he started a family, he began planting his own crops of potatoes, peas and corn.  Tending to his crops requires much patience.  He wakes up at 4am to begin watering or fumigating.  By 8am, he has moved on to removing weeds.  When his crops have been harvested, he sends them directly to the largest market in the city of Tarma where producers go to get the best price.  Manuel is very pleased with his work and with that of his wife and children.  He does not have to hire workers to harvest crops because he would rather pay his children to do it.  He hopes this will motivate them to start their own farms.  Manuel acknowledges that agriculture has helped educate his children and provided for his family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.   He was able to join because he was invited by a neighbor, so he is very grateful.  He is committed to following the group rules and making his payments on time.  The money he is requesting will be used to buy chemical fertilizers and 24 kilos of corn for the next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":514.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734230,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T18:28:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128767,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yolanda es una joven madre muy trabajadora, tiene 29 a\u00f1os.

Yolanda no piensa dejar sus cultivos, por lo contrario, los ha incrementado, ya que sabe que ahora no tendr\u00e1 dificultad en el transporte de sus productos. Ahora, en cuanto va cosechando va cargando directamente a su carro los sacos para transportarlos hasta el mercado de Tarma, por ello, siente que su trabajo se hace m\u00e1s liviano. Yolanda se siente muy feliz con sus cultivos y su movilidad, con la que pos\u00f3 orgullosa. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, est\u00e1 muy contenta de pertenecer a un banco comunal, pues lo que m\u00e1s la motiv\u00f3 a ingresar fue el seguro de vida que se incluye con el cr\u00e9dito. El dinero que ahora solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para sus cultivos y tambi\u00e9n para el pago de la tarjeta de circulaci\u00f3n de su veh\u00edculo.","en":"Yolanda is 29 years old and a hardworking young mother.  Since the birth of her second daughter, her work at home has increased.  She also supports her mother-in-law who lives with her at home.  Yolanda manages to have time for farming along the way, and thanks to her attentiveness, she achieved an abundant harvest of potatoes and peas that are of high quality.  She decided to sell her crops directly at the largest market in the city of Lima.  Her earnings will be used to purchase a car that her husband can use as a passenger taxi.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda has no intention to quit farming.  In fact, she plans to increase her production since she will no longer have difficulty transporting her products.  She can load sacks of produce into her car and transport them to the market in Tarma, which will make her work load feel lighter.  Yolanda is very happy with her harvest and the ability to move her produce.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Yolanda\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is happy to be part of a communal bank.  She was prompted to join upon learning that life insurance was included as a benefit of her loan.

M. is a 35-year-old woman living in the town of Fasitoo tai.  She is married and has 6 school-aged children.  To make a living, Epenesa owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Epenesa has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Epenesa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Epenesa is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Epenesa from SPBD.  Epenesa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C\u00fac has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell.  She is now requesting a loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell.  The loan will be her seventh loan from Kiva partner the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. C\u00fac plans to use the additional revenue to improve her general living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.  N.

L. is from the village of Catadman Manabay, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 36 years old, is married, and has four school-aged children.\r\n\r\nNicole owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily selling banana cue (plantain, fried in boiling oil and held on a skewer) in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nicole joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and for daily consumption. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":369119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

V. lives in the village of Gata Diot, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 36 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mercedita runs a sari-sari or general store where she sells products for daily use such as soap, shampoo and toothpaste. Mercedita has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nLast year, Mercedita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid seven previous loans from GDMPC, and is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP to invest in expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He will use his loan to buy pig food and piglets to raise, as well as to buy fertilizer for growing his crop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":369210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig food and piglets to raise, as well as to buy fertilizer for his crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.366667 103.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chhum","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73616856,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87054802,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96969681,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103814619,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110706610,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118099227,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123935313,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128969404,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137056098,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-14T02:08:01Z","paid_date":"2010-05-18T08:02:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128823,"name":"Maria Nelfie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Nelfie P. is from the village of Catadman, Manabay, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 30 year old Ruth M. from Mbozi. She is married with four children between the ages of 2 and 10. Ruth has been running a Mama Lishe business since 2006.  Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe - A mama lishe (local restaurant or caf\u00e9) in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by three employees. Ruth currently earns about 120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to pay rent for several months. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of her business. Ruth thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To pay rent for several months","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T09:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105866,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022977,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868218,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757414,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146508,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984653,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T05:03:13Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128865,"name":"Jihad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jihad, a 45 year old father of two, owns a gift shop in Nabatiyeh, South Lebanon.

This is 70-year old Paulina M. from Mbozi. Paulina is a widow with six children, between the ages of 20 and 40.

She works 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Paulina currently earns about 100USD a month. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of her business. Paulina thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":369358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T14:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105871,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022982,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868223,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757419,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146513,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":154466.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984658,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T06:49:59Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":128884,"name":"Mrs. Sokheng Toch Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twenty people who live in Slab Ta Aon village in Kandal province have formed a village bank.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":369367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bulk rice bags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema H.

S. is from the village of Catadman, Manabay, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 27 years old, married, and has one young child. To make a living Charie owns and operates a sari-sari or general store. Her main source of income comes primarily from selling daily use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste etc. Charie has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Charie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charie is requesting her first loan from GDMPC, for 5000 PHP which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n<br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":369207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Matilda is 40 years old, divorced with three children between the ages of 22 and 26. Matilda has been running a mama lishe business since 2007. A mama lishe (local restaurant or caf\u00e9) in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\n\r\nMatilda works at the business 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is assisted by her daughter. Matilda currently earns about 60USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar and maize flour in bulk. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open a new location. Matilda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar, and maize flour in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-17T12:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilda E.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more common household goods for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Huruma E.

This is 34-year-old Getruda N. from Mbozi. She is married and has three children, who are between the ages of 3 and 9. \r\n\r\nGetruda has made a living running a \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 2003. Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe is the name for a local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania that usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour) and plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat and a variety of sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours a day, six days a week and gets help from one employee. Getruda currently earns about $130 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan to buy more rice, maize flour, salt, sugar and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new location. Getruda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women through the provision of a leasing and leaseback-microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, because they are considered non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She lives with her husband Ernesto, age 55, who works with their son Enzo (age 29) at the harbor. The family owns their house. For a year Ysabel has worked making necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, which she learned to make at a technical school for costume jewelery. This work is bringing her good income, along with the other small businesses she has. She owns a motor-taxi that she rents daily, makes a variety of handicrafts, and recently started selling catalog-order shoes. \r\n\r\nYsabel's desire to work and make progress motivate her dedication to her work, which continues to grow. She is always thinking of new businesses that she could start, as she doesn't want to depend only on her husband. Although having so many activities makes her tired she doesn't think it's a reason to stop working; on the contrary, she demands more of herself and is already used to the workload. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ysabel wants to expand her businesses and earn better income. This loan will be her 15th with MFP and each loan has helped her advance her businesses. On her part, she has always been punctual and very appreciative of her fellow group members. This is her first individual loan. The money she requests will be invested in 3 of her businesses: she will buy materials to make more jewelery, increase her stock of shoes, and refurbish her motor-taxi.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is 50 years old and has four children between the ages of 9 and 19. They all attend school. Raquel went to school until the fourth grade and then had to stop because of the difficult financial situation her parents faced when Mozambique was still a Portuguese colony.\r\n\r\nRaquel went to live with her husband in the Boane district when she was 24 years old. She hasn't been anywhere else in the country since she left Maputo. She's worked selling meals in Boane's central market since 1986. She learned the business from her mother. She doesn't have any employees, and depends on her daughters for assistance. They alternate shifts when they're not in school.\r\n\r\nShe serves beef with xima (a type of Mozambican corncake or polenta), which she sells for 35 meticals a meal. Her monthly income is 4000 meticals, which she uses to support her family, and sometimes manages to save a little money in a local bank account.\r\n\r\nRaquel has never received loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through friends. After the Boane office opened, she requested a loan in the amount of 8000 meticals, and further additional loans in the amounts of 10,000; 15,000; and 20,000 meticals, respectively. All of her loans have been used for the same purpose. Raquel will use this loan of 25,000 meticals to purchase ingredients for her meals and expand her business to respond to growing demand. She intends to pay off the loan in full without difficulty so she can request other loans that she will use to begin raising chickens.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea

He has been a teacher at \"Casa do Gaiato\" (orphanage and arts & crafts school) for the past nine years. His monthly salary of 10.000,00 mt allows him to support his family and save some money.\r\n\r\nSabino heard about Hluvuku-Adsema from friends. He will be using this, his second loan, to buy construction material to finish his house. He expects to pay this loan back without problems, as he did with the first one.

To do this, she rented land where she set up honeycombs. Carmen consulted others on techniques in order to have new honeycomb groups and to increase her honey production, which she collects every 3 months and puts it in plastic containers in order to provide the best presentation for her product. Her clients are people that live in another city and that's why she travels periodically in order to supply them with merchandise. Thus, she makes income that allows her to provide for her family.

She is studying for a technical career in the city of Chiclay.\r\n\r\nThe scant resources they have to support their daily expenses and the maintenance of their lentil crop have motivated her to come to the institution a second time to ask for a loan for 1,500 PEN.  She intends to buy fertilizers and pesticides to fertilize and maintain her crops.\r\n\r\nClara had a previous loan with the Institution, and she paid it back punctually.  Therefore, she is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He lives with his wife and youngest child in the San Jos\u00e9 cove, a fishing region located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has devoted almost his whole life to fishing.  This is temporary work.  Because of the closed fishing season, he does not fish all year.  During these seasons he worked in a nearby shipyard, but he had to leave that work due to his age.  For three years he has had a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (a vehicle used for transportation), which he uses to earn the daily sustenance for his family.\r\n\r\nDue to its constant use, the vehicle has started to suffer from some mechanical problems.  That is why he saw the need to ask the institution for a loan for 500 PEN.  He will use the loan to fix and maintain his vehicle in order to continue supporting his family.\r\n\r\nMiguel has had four previous loans with the Institution.  He repaid them punctually.  He is a very responsible person who has known how to support and help his 10 children succeed.  Nine of his children are married and have diverse jobs in the region where they live.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to give his youngest child the opportunity to continue his education.  This way he will be assured of a promising future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"Maintenance of mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":40.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":41.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027744,"comment":null},{"amount":14.71,"local_amount":42.02,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939641,"comment":null},{"amount":15.62,"local_amount":44.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":45.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780549,"comment":null},{"amount":16.32,"local_amount":46.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669453,"comment":null},{"amount":16.89,"local_amount":48.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":49.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064963,"comment":null},{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":50.51,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900080,"comment":null},{"amount":18.88,"local_amount":53.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":55.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934214,"comment":null},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":55.13,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":56.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661866,"comment":null},{"amount":20.42,"local_amount":58.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":59.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694587,"comment":null},{"amount":21.14,"local_amount":60.39,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877654,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T16:18:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129084,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marilyn M. is from the village of Lawis Panalsalan.

R. is from the village of Calabayan, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 33 years old. Dorina is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Dorina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas to sell in the local community. Dorina has been in the business for more than 5 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Dorina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dorina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Dorina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and for daily consumption. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is from the village of Tabid, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 44 years old. Flora is married and has 4 children. To make a living, Flora owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising seaweed. The main source of income for the business comes from cultivating and harvesting seaweed for sale. Flora has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Flora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Flora is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seaweed seedlings for production. This will be the second loan taken out by Flora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Salvacion earns a monthly income of P18,000.00 through the sale of these cleaning commodities. <p>\r\n\r\nSalvacion has just finished paying off her previous loan with CCT and is now applying for a new loan to purchase raw materials for soap making.  She longs to have a place in a commercial center where she can sell her products. She joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005 and has since been receiving \u201cblessings from heaven.\u201d  Salvacion is very thankful for God\u2019s continued provisions even in the midst of crisis (her father has just been paralyzed). <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT: <p>\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 9500 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Merlyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She has been engaged in this business for over four years.\n\nIn 2007, Paugata joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,500 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make mats and mattresses.\n\nPaugata is now requesting a new loan of 4,000 WST which will again be used to purchase raw materials to make mats and mattresses. The loan will be her 3rd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\n\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

F. is from the city of Oroquieta. She is 40 years old. Evangeline is married and has a school-aged child. To make a living, Evangeline owns and operates a \"pansit\" (fresh canton) business, making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Evangeline joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. \r\n<p>\r\nEvangeline is now requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her food products for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Evangeline from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Editha has been engaged in her business for some years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Editha joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Editha is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise & sell in the future and for snack vending at their place. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Editha from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Margarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Margarita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Margarita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
