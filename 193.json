The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Rosette O. has a dairy business and is currently branching out into pig farming. 5 years ago, Rosette had 4 local cows, but they were not producing milk that would earn a good profit.  So, Rosette sold those cows and bought 2 Heifers.  After some time, she took those female cows to be impregnated.  She says that in Uganda, you can use in-vitro fertilization or you can just take your female to a place where there are males and leave them for some time.  <P>\r\n\r\nNow, she has the two original cows, plus three young female ones that are not yet old enough to produce milk.  The cows that are producing milk, produce between 5 and 8 liters per day.  After she milks them, there is a man who comes and purchases the milk for between 400 \u2013 500 USH per liter.    Rosette wants to purchase a male cow so that she will no longer have to pay the fee associated with getting her cows pregnant.  She also wants to buy a few more calves, rather than waiting for her cows to give birth again.  She will use a portion of her 2 mil UGH loan to do these things. <P>    \r\n\r\nRecently, Rosette has noticed that there is a large demand for the products of pig farming so she has decided to branch out into that.  She started by purchasing two pigs, and one is now pregnant!  But, she does not yet have a formal place to keep her pigs.  She is planning to use a large portion of her loan to build a pig pen on her farm.    <P>\r\n\r\n Rosette is a single mother of six children.  Her children range from 9 to 18.  The father of her children left her years ago, and then recently passed away.  Before he passed away, he was helping her to pay school fees for the children, but now that he has passed away it is up to her alone.     <P>\r\n\r\nShe says that as her children age, it is very important to be able to meet their needs.

Marufjon is 52 years old. He is married with 5 children. Marufjon sells dried fruit in the central local market. He has been in this business for 11 years. Dried fruit is very popular in Tajikistan. Any hostess keeps dried fruit on hand to serve when guests visit, and dried fruit is as a rule served at all family occasions, like wedding parties, birthday parties and others. Considering the constant demand for this kind of goods, Marufjon's business is quite successful and brings in stable income for his family. Now Marufjon wants to increase the stock of his goods in order to be able to supply his buyers' demands. To do this, he is requesting a loan of 2500 Somoni for a 9-month term. Marufjon would like to thank all for their support and promises to pay the loan on time.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after the country\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after the country\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is a small producer in the district of Djabbar Rasulov in Tajikistan. Together with his wife (pictured), he's been raising cattle for more than 12 years. These cattle produce the income which allows him to feed his three children and his wife. \r\n<p>\r\nAs well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates wheat, which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income. Rashid has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 28 years old and makes a living buying and selling livestock. He's married with two young children who he must feed and educate. Over the years, Gafurjon has become very knowledgeable about what is required to raise cattle: their feeding, their calving, etc. \r\n<p>\r\nIt should be noted that, in the past, this young man endured hard economic times for a while, but he's managed to come through thanks to the help provided by IMON International, Kiva's partner. IMON International has granted loans that Gafurjon has used to buy calves, which is also the reason he needs this loan now. The loan will greatly improve Gafurjon\u2019s income and his family's living standards. In the photo you can see Gafurjon\u2019s mother, who helps him with feeding his cattle.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and children in their own house. She has been selling juices at a stall in her local market for 12 years. Every morning she attends to her business, and finds generating her own income and interacting with the people who come to drink one of the fruit juices she prepares both entertaining and fulfilling. Gladys considers her business worthwhile, because there are always people consuming what she's offering, so she'd like to open another stall in the market and hire a young woman to attend it. This is her first loan with MFP, and she was one of the people who was most enthusiastic about forming the communal bank to which she belongs.

She lives with her husband and children in a family house in a small farming community called Hweakwae in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The major occupation of the dwellers in this community is farming. The land is rich in nutrients and as a result, many inhabitants combine trading and farming activities. \r\nAnna is into the palm oil production business.

At 50, she has managed to have her own house. She lives by herself since she never had children with her ex-husband, who she divorced. She is an adept artisan and utilizes the bulrush (a wetland plant) to create beautiful and striking artisanal pieces, which she sells to her customers at a good price. Although she did not finish primary education due to the lack of necessary funds, she was not discouraged. She followed her plans to have a dignified life and to continue with the things she has always dreamed of doing. She has fought hard to forge a good life. She knows that she still needs to continue making jewelry. She has spent 20 years in this business. What she likes the most is that she can make new, creative designs which result in improved sales. What she finds the most difficult is to make the small details to her pieces to make them more beautiful. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of having her own store where she can sell her pieces with the most comfort and tranquility. It is her first loan with MFP and she is very happy for this opportunity. She understands that she must pay the loan on time and is determined to do so. The communal bank is very beloved, as it always provides council for the other members.

She is 52 and raised two children. Her husband works, but doesn't earn enough to support the family. Matlubahon has a sewing machine and therefore takes orders to sew national dresses.

Trabajar de esta manera le permite a Eulogia tener los ingresos econ\u00f3micos para su sustento, y siempre obtiene las ganancias que ha planificado para la semana. Para el futuro desea tener en su casa una tienda de abarrotes y establecerse en su localidad con la venta de los alimentos. Es la cuarta vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella es considerada como persona de confianza en el tema de los cr\u00e9ditos y le gusta ser parte de un trabajo solidario en su banco comunal. Eulogia solicita esta cantidad de dinero para invertirlo en la compra de m\u00e1s productos alimenticios para potenciar su capital de trabajo, de esta manera tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s ganancias. ","en":"Eulogia is 51 years old and lives alone in her own home.  For 20 years she has been travelling to other cities to sell foods typical of her region (cheeses and trout).  She travels alone every weekend to the capital city with her products in airtight containers, so she can sell them in the main markets.  Working this way permits Eulogia to have the income to support herself, and she always manages to earn what she expected to get through the week.  In the future she wants to have a grocery store in her house, and establish herself in her neighborhood with grocery sales.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, and she is considered a very trustworthy woman in regards to loans, and she likes to be part of the work in solidarity of her communal bank.

To increase his income, he left his country trying to forge a more promising future, but the economic crisis forced him to return to Peru. \r\n\r\nSoon after, he opened up a restaurant that, even though is only six months old has attracted a large number of costumers. This is mostly due to the seasoning that Jaime\u2019s wife makes. She is the one who prepares the delicious meals and Jaime attends to the costumers with respect and joviality. They work together every day from 8am until 10pm, sharing the work as a couple.  \r\n\r\nOne of their dreams is to have an automobile to carry the supplies they purchase for the restaurant and, during Jaime\u2019s free time, to use it as a taxi to generate additional income. \r\n\r\nThis would be the first loan with MFP and Jaime is very happy for the opportunity and trust. The loan would give them the chance to grow along with their business. He will use the loan to buy utensils and tables for the restaurant.         <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elsa  Mejia Connelly, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":290442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy utensils and tables for his restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T09:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":251.19},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":268.31},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":282.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":303.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":315.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":330.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":343.32},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":353.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":251.19,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":252.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012222,"comment":null},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":261.23,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":262.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595802,"comment":null},{"amount":84.96,"local_amount":268.31,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":269.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990070,"comment":null},{"amount":89.43,"local_amount":282.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":283.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211202,"comment":null},{"amount":92.18,"local_amount":291.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640711,"comment":null},{"amount":95.99,"local_amount":303.12,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":304.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080192,"comment":null},{"amount":99.96,"local_amount":315.66,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":316.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996472,"comment":null},{"amount":104.53,"local_amount":330.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":331.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841979,"comment":null},{"amount":220.69,"local_amount":696.87,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":699.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733760,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Like every mother, she longed to give her children a good education. Since it was her top priority, she went to work every morning. But over the course of time her eldest son became aware of the need and was eager to work. When he graduated he used his savings from his work to install some internet stations in their house, giving his mother the opportunity to run her own business. The business is 6 years old now and she manages it happily. But her entrepreneurial spirit inspired her to install telephone booths beside the computers, which has helped her neighbors with their communications and increased her earnings. In the future, Tarcila would like to continue expanding her services, and would like to install a pharmacy in the corner of the house, since her daughters studied pharmacy and it would be an additional service to provide her neighbors. She's been working with MFP for four years, and this is her eighth loan.

She is an active member of Morning Glory Center credit services and her highest loan was Php 10,000.00, which she used as additional capital for buying assorted dry goods. They were challenged with financial difficulties. Her business was affected and they had no other source of income aside from her business.\r\n<p>\r\nBut despite those challenges, she\u2019s trying to move on in order to recover. She\u2019s now on her fourth loan amounting to Php 10,0000.00 to purchase additional items like t-shirts, shorts, pants, curtains, pillows and many other items. She is very thankful to Paglaum for giving her another chance. \r\n<p>\r\nHer hope and aspiration in life is to expand and have a stable business someday, and that all her children are able to finish

The couple is operating a \"carenderia,\" or small restaurant, at their residence. Mrs. P. started her business from her family's own savings. As she observed, her income is enough only to pay the lending, which is collected each day. <p>\r\n\r\nMrs. P. applied for membership in  Paglaum MPC, a Kiva partner, and was officially accepted in September 2006.  She is seeking a loan from Paglaum in the amount of Php 11,000.00.<p>\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business will become a fast-food restaurant someday and that all her children can finish their studies and have stable careers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":290550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional

One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their business equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To  purchase rice, wheat flour, eggs and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Happyness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613672,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010751,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233037,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664828,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105540,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022668,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867917,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757118,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146230,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T02:07:08Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96322,"name":"Valeria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania!

Afsona describes herself as a hard-working, enterprising and happy married mother of two children. Her husband is a laborer. She decided to start a sewing business to help him with household expenses, since she wanted her children to get an education and that wasn't possible on her husband's salary alone. She started out helping a woman who ran a tailoring shop, and after she learned the trade she was offered a job. As time went on, the owner passed away, and Afsona always remembered how the owner had encouraged her to start her own business. So that's what she did, installing a small shop in her home. It has gone very well since then, and she has been able to grow the business. In addition to her tailoring business, Afonsa also provides a service teaching young girls. Because of that, she became very well-known in her community and has many orders. Currently, Afsona is requesting a loan of $ 3000 USD for a term of 12 months, which she will use to purchase anew sewing machine with computer-based embroidery so she can fulfill all her customers' requests. Afsona and her family are very grateful for your support in helping grow this business and move ahead. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She's a teacher. Besides teaching time at school, she has a lot of free time to take care of family and do some small business.

to his family and his business, U.

For this reason, he turns to IMON International again, to obtain a loan which will allow him to acquire cattle and help him improve the standard of living for his beloved family. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, including a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets-Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities still speaking the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization dating back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R and further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

years old and the mother of three children.  Her husband works at the market as a cook in a cafeteria. Five years ago, Hikmatoy worked in a kindergarten as a childcare provider.  The salary was very low, so her sister arranged for Hikmatoy to work with her in a shop as a saleswoman.  Hikmatoy quit her job and started to work with her sister. For two years, Hikmatoy worked with her sister for a salary.  Later, her husband gave her money to open a business.  In the beginning, Hikmatoy went in on the business with her sister.   Then, having learned about sales, Hikmatoy began to work independently.  Her inventory consists of female underwear.

client.  She uses her loans to procure goods.  She wants to repay the loan in eight months.  Her sales are good enough that she must restock often.  She says that if necessary, she will request a secondary loan. During three years of taking out loans, according to Muazzam, she has managed to expand sales several times.  She had one shop, and now she has three in which her sons work.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":290676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, beans, cooking oil, sugar, wheat flour and maize flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613674,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010753,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233039,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664830,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T15:59:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96380,"name":"Maha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maha is a 29 year old woman who lives in Bint Jbeil, in southern Lebanon with her husband and their two children.

He's married and has four school-attending children. He's been working for 20 years. At first, he was a fisherman : he used to go fishing with his younger brother Isaac. However, this business was not very profitable and, 5 years ago, he decided to start another business in addition to fishing. He now also sells sand. Indeed, Elie contracted friends who go collect sand in the Cotonou lagoon with their small boats. Cotonou is the economic capital of Benin. Elie did already benefit from two loans from Kiva's partner Alid\u00e9, and, as a result, his standard of living improved. He's now seeking a third loan in order to increase his revenues. Lagoon sand is currently in high demand, which is why Elie needs this loan.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nAlid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

Since her childhood, she was working the land, where was sowing bananas, citrus, coffee, and kion, but five years ago, she started her business of buying and selling fruits and kion with the help of her husband, who is responsible for traveling to farmhouses in the morning to make the purchases. After accumulating the products in his warehouse, Doris puts the kion in sacks and puts the fruit in boxes, so that her cargo is ready when the truck that transports them to the market in Lima arrives. Doris is very happy with her work and what she likes most is selling, which lets her be in contact with people and lets her forget about some physical discomforts that she has. In all this time, her business has generated very good incomes, which have permitted her to pay for her children\u2019s educations, which she hopes to continue even more than agriculture. Doris is very motivated by being part of this new community bank and has offered support in the educational talks to her credit advisor, and in this way, she promises to pay her installments punctually.

From childhood, she did not have much time for playing. Her work was to support her parents in cultivating their farms. Since there were many children, her family lacked the money for them to go to school. She committed herself to thinking that their situation would change, but this did not occur. When she had her own family, her work increased. Now she wakes up at 5:00am to make food for her children. She cooks and hours later, goes to the farm with her husband to help him cultivate pineapples. In an effort to increase her earnings, 3 months ago, she started to sell plants and flowers from the orchards, earning between 1 to 5 soles for each one. But apart from her financial struggles, Fausta is very happy with her family. She says that every day her children motivate her to work in the farm, even though from youth, she didn\u2019t like this work. Now she has many expectations from working with the loans in her community bank, from which she has many positive ideas. She also promises to make her payments punctually. The money she requests is to buy plants and in this way to increase her sales, so that over time, she will be able to accumulate more earnings for her home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":290741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy more plants to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T11:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012234,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595814,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990082,"comment":null},{"amount":16.68,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211214,"comment":null},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":105.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640723,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T14:58:10Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96413,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy tiene 29 a\u00f1os, es conviviente y madre de 3 hijos, que viven en su casa.

SLRA was established in 1993 by an Act of Parliament charged with the responsibility of constructing and rehabilitating all roads, bridges and ferries in Sierra Leone. It is a civil engineering institution. SLRA Makeni is responsible for roads, bridges and ferries in Bombali, Koindadugu, part of Tonkolili and part of Kambia districts, in northern Sierra Leone. SLRA Makeni has a total of twenty-one staff. Over the years, SLRA Makeni has been able to construct many roads in the township of Makeni, making the town accessible to vehicles.  \r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan members of SLRA Makeni are requesting from SMT. Previously, only nine staff members applied for a loan from SMT. With the success of the previous loans to staff, six new members of staff were encouraged to join their colleagues in applying for a loan this time around. With a loan, staff members will be able to invest it in something needed and out of their monthly salaries, they will repay the loan. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture like a bed or chairs, other will use theirs to invest in business, some will invest theirs in a house-building project and others will use the loan to pay for their children's schooling.\r\n\r\nAnthony S. K. (first from left) is a member of the three-man loan recovery committee and also head of security for SLRA Makeni. Anthony was born in Port Loko, northern Sierra Leone. He is age fifty-five, married to a teacher and they have four children together. Two of his children are in class six, one is in class five and the last is in class two.

Madeleine T. is married to Bernard MIFFOKPO and has 4 children, all scolarised. Madeleine T. has been in business for 20 years. She buys oil to suppliers from Nigeria and sells it by wholesale as well as by retail.\r\nThis will be her third credit with ALID\u00e9. Madeleine is already very happy to be able to benefit from a credit in ALID\u00e9: it avoids her any worry about financing her business. \r\nMadeleine is asking for a third credit to buy and stock a significant amount of oil so that she can better satisfy market's demand.

SDA Primary school, Makeni was founded in 1978 by SDA Makeni to use education as a vehicle for spreading the Adventist message. They train young boys in the morals and ethics of the Adventist Mission. Presently, the school has a population of fifty-six pupils and a staff of twelve teachers.<p>\r\n\r\nPresently, SDA Makeni suffers a number of constrains. First, they lack a water-well. The tap-head of the well they used to have has been stolen, forcing the children to fetch drinking water from the neighborhood. Second, SDA suffers from lack of sufficient benches and classrooms. They used to have sufficient benches, but rebels used all of those benches as firewood. Then Plan Sierra Leone (an NGO) provided them with new ones, only for people around the neighborhood to steal all of them again. Thus the children have to carry their own benches from home every day to school.<p>\r\n\r\nHowever, with the change of administration three months ago, SDA Primary school is revitalizing, thanks to the new headmaster, Mr. Benjamin Kamara (not part of this loan). The new administration is able to buy benches for classes five and six through school fees subsidies and development funds. The school has also been able to hire two security guards to keep thieves at bay. And for the first time in the history of the school, they will be organizing athletics for the pupils. This will give popularity and fame to the school.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbdul K. K. (back row, second from right) is the leader of this group of teachers. Abdul was born in Mamamah, about 110 miles from Makeni. He is age forty-eight, married to a teacher and the two of them have two children. One of their children is in class four and the other is in class two. Abdul will invest his loan in business and he has been in business for over four years now.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":290802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Invest in Business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mara M.

When she was single, she used to plant crops in her parents\u2019 fields, mostly citrus fruits, but since she fell in love with a farmer who is an expert in cultivating coffee and cacao, she has increased her plantings with these crops.  Six years ago she transplanted coffee plants into her orchard, between the trees, and in the first harvest she was quite successful. This allowed her to buy a car in order to get deeper into the fields where there are no roads to gather the harvest of citrus fruits, coffee and cacao.  This vehicle has also allowed her to earn money transporting her neighbors\u2019 crops, charging between 80 and 100 Soles (Peruvian currency) per load depending on the distance and the cost of the product.  When her husband travels with his produce to different markets, she returns in her vehicle to continue gathering crops for the next trip.  This way she and her husband organize themselves and work hard to progress and educate their children.  \r\n\r\nDora worked for many years with individual loans and had never belonged to a communal bank so she has many expectations about how it works.

Some years ago she only grew bananas and citrus fruits. Since living with her husband she has incremented her crops and grows coffee in some rented fields, where she is charged 150 soles for each harvest. Growing this product is very hard; once it is harvested it has to be washed, later spead out on the ground to dry, later toasted and finally ground. But it has turned out to be very profitable because they supply a business which places orders every week once the harvest begins. They take advantage of those times during which they accumulate earnings to buy school uniforms and supplies for their children and clothing for themselves. Norma likes farming because there are times when they have good earnings. She is thinking about increasing her coffee crops so she can increase her output. This is her first loan with MFP, for which she commits to making repayments responsibly. The members of the communal bank have named her secretary, a position she assumes with great responsibility.

Ten years ago, together with her husband, she started a business selling liqueur. What is special about their products is that they add in pure honey. During this time they have been able to gain some good and loyal customers who visit their store every weekend, and this has allowed them to increase their earnings. This motivated them to begin preparing soft drinks; their earnings are double what they invest and this makes them very pleased with their business. In addition, her husband tends to some fields, so their earnings come from different sources.

She has a business, Delicious, to make ice cream, which she distributes to nearby stores in her neighborhood, where it is sold quickly due to its pleasant flavor. \r\n\r\nShe decided to go into this business when she was 16, when she observed that there was not enough money in the home. She now has seven years in this activity and hopes to continue much longer. What Edith likes best about her work is that she can eat the ice cream she wants while preparing it, because she has to sample the flavor of her product. She thinks that in the future she could put a brand mark on her ice cream and so be able to compete in the Juliaca city market. The hard part is to bear the cold while preparing the ice cream, yet she is still ready to continue with this business, with the sole purpose of improving her life. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan she has with MFP. She has always been very punctual in her payments and expects to be punctual now also. She feels very comfortable in her community bank, and always gets advice from the other members.

O., 28, lives with her parents and younger sister in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Since 2007, she has been running a cellular phone sales business through a rented stall at the Tedy center. Tedy is the biggest cellular phone sales center in Ulaanbaatar.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen she began her retail business, her working capital was 1.5 million MNT ($1USD=1,600 MNT). She pays $230 monthly to rent her stall. Mongolmaa's average monthly income is 3 million MNT, and her average monthly profit from her business is 300,000 MNT. Once every three months she visits Ereen, a Chinese border city where many Mongolians who run businesses buy their goods, and brings back cheap cell phones to resell. Now, her working capital has increased to 5 million MNT. Her business has become quite successful. She is the only one in her family who brings in an income, as her parents are retired.

She started her business with some small capital. \r\n\r\nShe heard from a friend about Paglaum; she was convinced to join and immediately applied for membership. She was recognized last Aug. 27, 2008, and used the credit services for additional capital of her existing Sari-Sari Store. She is applying for Php 5,000 to purchase additional inventories such as canned goods and bottled items.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is thankful that Paglaum became her financing partner. She added that it is a big help for the family to have additional capital for the business. For now Mrs. F. continues doing her daily activities and struggling against poverty.

Albertine is married and has three children, of which only the eldest goes to school.\r\nSince she was a child, Albertine has been selling fish, first with her mother, then on her own. But two months ago, Albertine also started to sell food (prepared beans, to be eaten with bread or manioc flour and red oil). Albertine has already received two credits with ALID\u00e9. She requested a third loan to strengthen her food sales activity. Albertine hopes to help her husband who is a fisherman with her profits, to buy a small boat to go fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meaning of ALID\u00e9 in Benin local language - Fon - is \"a path always exists for the poorest\". Benin is a small West African country located next to Nigeria, with a GDP per capita of $1,500.

The women average 35 years of age and 5 children each.  They live together in the Rails Ko district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), where they know one another through ties of community and friendship.  They were knowledgeable of Soro Yiriwaso (a micro-finance institution) following a general assembly held at the town hall of the rural community of Markala that was intended for artisans and small-scale entrepreneurs of the aforementioned town.  The women excel in the food sector (restaurants, selling grocery items, etc.)  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned with satisfying their customers, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program and are now on their fourth solidarity loan (group loan) after having correctly repaid the first three.  This loan will be used to buy:  two sacks of fresh onions, one basin of fresh tomatoes, two basins of dried okra (a portion in powdered form), two sacks of <i>fonio<\/i> (a kind of millet), one sack of peanuts for making into <i>djouga<\/i> (couscous made of <i>fonio<\/i> and peanuts), two boxes of potatoes to be sold fried or stewed, two sacks of sugar, one sack of ginger, one sack of dried hibiscus flowers, 25 kg of powdered milk, and one box of flavorings for making beverages (ginger and <i>dableni<\/i>:  a drink of hibiscus flower and yoghurt).  \r\n<p>\r\nSupplies of potatoes, <i>fonio<\/i>, and peanuts are gotten in Sikasso.  As for the goods for making local beverages and the condiments, these are gotten at the Diamarabougou fair.  Sales are made to customers composed of men, women, and children, cash or credit accepted, at the house, door-to-door, in eateries, and at the marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 43,750 francs CFA for making loan payments and for buying school supplies for the children.  Their objective is to have a house for living in.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

To earn money, Apner usually sells bananas, cucumbers, vegetables, cassavas, corns and coconuts in the traditional market as well as the markets in Kupang City, but he feels that the income that he earns is not enough to meet his family needs. Apner is a married man and has 4 children who are: Ricki N. 15 years old - in Junior High School Grade 3; Frengki N. 13 years old - in Elementary School Grade 6; Nonci N. 11 years old who has suffered from deafness since she was born. Apner can not send her to school because there is no school for deaf people in this village. And the last one is Reni N. 5 years old \u2013 who studies in the Kindergarten.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Apner wants to improve his income by running another business. He is interested in the cattle fattening program because it can generate a large profit. Apner is requesting Rp. 3,300,000 to buy cattle to be fattened. The same as Apner, the other group members are also requesting loans from TLM to buy cattle to be fattened over the 12 month period. They will repay the initial cost of the cattle and get the profit after selling the cattle. \r\n\r\nNote: The group picture was taken separately because 4 members of this group are involved in building the church in their village. Yurita also wasn't present when the group picture was taken, so her husband replaced her in the group picture."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":291061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T06:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apner","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonifasius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maklon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frengki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yurita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Zet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Misraim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorensius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":32800000,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":32800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":553.35,"local_amount":6600000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6626306.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755431,"comment":null},{"amount":2196.65,"local_amount":26200000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26304428.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:04:36Z","paid_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96568,"name":"S\u00e9raphine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

He is married and has been blessed with 3 children. His children are: Thobias R., 18 years old; Merry Rasi, 15 years old \u2013 in Junior High School Grade 3; and Marthen R., 13 years old. Both Thobias and Marthen are not at school because they want to help their father (Zakarias) to earn money by farming. In this village, Zakarias works as a farmer who finances his family and the education of his children by selling banana, coconut and cassava. Sometimes the daily income that he earns is not enough to meet his family's needs. This is the reason why Zakarias wants to run another business. He is requesting a loan amounting to Rp 3,200,000 to buy cattle to be fattened.  Zakarias is interested in joining the cattle fattening program because he can benefit by the profit of the cattle sale. He has a dream to send his children to the university. \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group also face the same situation as Zakarias faces. Their income from farming is not enough to meet their family's needs. And like Zakarias, they also want to improve their standard of living by running another business. They are interested in the cattle fattening program because they feel that this program can help them to generate more income for their family and for that reason, they are requesting a loan to buy cattle to be fattened. \r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Anika and Sarluta weren\u2019t present, so their husbands replaced them in the group picture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":291118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zakarias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Argop","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominggus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominggus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frengki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignasius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarluta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Theresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakobus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohanis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":48500000,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":48500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":4075,"local_amount":48500000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":48797361.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110773581,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T20:20:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:36:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96573,"name":"L\u00e9a","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

Her business consists in selling charcoal, which is very profitable in Lom\u00e9 where charcoal is very much used to cook food. She started this business in 1999, and turns a good profit because she gets her supply in the interior of the country where sacks of charcoal are less expensive. Wanting to bolster her business, she's seeking a loan from Kiva's partner WAGES in order to purchase sacks of charcoal. She's divorced from her husband and has two children. She works hard to support them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

Fortunately, he made good sales and his business is growing thanks to the quality of his products and the good service he provides. Abdukarim now needs a $ 2500 USD loan which he will use to buy goods to respond to his customers\u2019 demand. He promises to repay this loan in 12 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kurbon is married. His wife is a homemaker and they have a two-year-old child. \r\n\r\nHe has always been a hard worker. He started working at an early age, helping his mother with her clothing business, and contributing his earnings to them from the time that he was 15 years old. When Kurbon married, his expenses increased and he had to strike out on his own to build a business that would support his own family. With the help of his father, he started his own clothing-sales business and his wife helped him in her spare time. His business has grown little by little but he wants to continue to grow in order to better quality of life. \r\n\r\nKurbon is asking for a $800 USD loan to buy merchandise for his business so that he can continue to expand it. He is offering to repay the loan in 12 months. He and his family are very grateful for the support you are providing to help them get ahead. \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hasanboy has dedicated himself to raising livestock. He is married and a father who needs to support his children, who no longer need his help to complete their studies. His wife also helps him with the business. \r\n\r\nHasanboy needs to purchase calves. To commercialize the derivative products, he sells the raised animals to farmers who then resupply the small farmers with calves. To acquire the animals to start the cycle, Hasanboy has come to IMON International to obtain the necessary credit. In this way, he will continue to maintain his dear home.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Urunbay is grateful to all who support him and promises to manage the loan with accuracy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He decided to take out a loan to repair his car and to drive it like a taxi with a fixed route.  He is planning to convert the car so that it runs on gas and the car will run on gas instead of on gasoline.  Gas is cheaper than gasoline, this is why he thinks this would be profitable.  His wife also works, she sells pastries on the street.

Experienced and talented in the business, Mahbuba has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family of three chidlren. Throughout the last year, IMON International has provided assistance to Mahbuba\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Mahbuba has used her previous loans wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni to replace depleted inventory, hoping to continue expanding her business and supporting her family.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

agriculture business is one that requires much effort for the simple reason that it requires exposure to the sun, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. Nabi U.  has dedicated himself for 20 years to cattle raising which supports his humble family who rely on him. Currently Nabi has turned to IMON International for a loan of $1350 USD to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his children and wife whom he loves greatly.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 36-year-old Hidaya S. from Mwanza. She is married with three children between the ages of two and thirteen. Hidaya has been running a tailoring business since 2004. Her business is making clothes, especially for women. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week. Hidaya currently earns about $80 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $325 USD to buy materials to make women clothes for resale. In the future, she plans to increase her efforts on her clothing business. Hidaya thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She's a single mother and lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. For two years she's sold drinks in a space she prepared in her house by arranging a small piece of furniture to serve as a counter. She only takes care of this business on Saturdays and Sundays because she's been working as a secretary in an institution for 27 years. Her son and daughter-in-law are in charge of the business during the week, and she runs it on the weekends. It's very profitable because it's in a good location, and her cold drinks are sold every day.

She's been raising chickens in a small shed in the rear of the house for two years. The business is going very well because she doesn't work alone: her husband also helps. This business is profitable because her chickens are ready to sell in less than 45 days and she sells them at a good price. She also has loyal customers. In the future, Carla would like to build another shed because the one she has only has room for 100 chickens, and she'd like to raise more. Her communal bank is called \"Trabajando juntos\" (\"Working Together\") and this is her seventh loan with MFP. She tells us that recently there have been some problems in her group, but she hopes they can be resolved quickly. Apart from that, she promises to be responsible in making her payments. She will invest the requested loan in purchasing chicks and feed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":291218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase chicks and feed to raise poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105.35},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":122.02},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":142.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.23,"local_amount":105.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":107.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012263,"comment":null},{"amount":36.94,"local_amount":113.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":116.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595845,"comment":null},{"amount":38.41,"local_amount":118.19,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":120.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990112,"comment":null},{"amount":39.67,"local_amount":122.02,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":124.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211238,"comment":null},{"amount":41.3,"local_amount":127.07,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":129.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640748,"comment":null},{"amount":43.37,"local_amount":133.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":136.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080213,"comment":null},{"amount":44.67,"local_amount":137.46,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":140.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996477,"comment":null},{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":142.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":145.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T19:46:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":96640,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel A. is married and has 4 dependents.
