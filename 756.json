The shop in which Kanymbu works also serves as a dining room.  One can have a bite to eat and buy the necessary food products.  Kanymbu has worked very hard to develop her business and has been very successful:  her business now brings in close to 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Today, Kanymbu doesn't have a wide range of food items.  This is why she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners and requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).

Since Abdukaum has been buying and selling livestock at a market from a young age, he has become an expert in pedigreed cows and sheep.  He currently owns two cows and six sheep.  With his loan, Abdukaum is planning to buy a cow and a few sheep.  His wife takes care of household chores and sells home-produced milk.  Beside his work in animal husbandry, Abdukaum also works as a builder in a construction team, but this activity is seasonal, so in the winter he is involved in the fattening and the sale of livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":979695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a cow and a few sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-01-12T07:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdukaum","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":806.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":860.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T17:11:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380129,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u042d\u043b\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0435 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c.  \u042d\u043b\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0430  -

Elvira plans to use the receipts from the loan for increasing her numbers of domestic livestock, and in the near-future \u2014 to renovate their house.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":317.2,"image":{"id":979704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-14T03:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8034},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6606},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6799},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6997},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7201},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7411},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7628},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7850},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8079},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8315},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8557},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6523}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":174.07,"local_amount":8034,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8124.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125491,"comment":null},{"amount":143.13,"local_amount":6606,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6680.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250646,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-14T17:51:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380130,"name":"Munyasya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munyasya is 36 years old, married and has four children.

What she does not like so much is when customers ask for credit for their purchases since she has had several bad experiences.

Now he feels there is more security because he can manage his own hours, in addition to being his own boss. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he comments that he does not like it when his taxi is broken too often because it leads to many expenses, but still he can see good results, for this reason he has plans to grow and be able to buy a transport vehicle for heavy cargo. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he wants to venture into the sale of clothing to obtain more wages. This will be his second loan with the institution MFP. He feels grateful for the financial support that he is receiving to be able to achieve his objectives. Moreover, he comments that he feels that he likes his communal bank because it treats all of its members well and he considers them to be good people. With the amount that he solicits of 1500 nuevos soles, he will invest it in the purchase of merchandise, like men's clothing which is an idea that his cousin gave him who also sells clothing."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":980147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing for men.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":226.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":224.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":247.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":258.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":263.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":279.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.87},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380383,"name":"Rebeca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal \u201cAndr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por personas responsables y trabajadores que sacan adelante a su familia.

He travels twice a week, bringing maca, peas and potatoes, which he sells at \"La parada\", the largest market in the country. \r\n\r\nAs he's a country man, he takes advantage of owning three horses and three donkeys and uses them as cargo animals to transport fertilizer to the fields. \"This way I get less tired,\" he explains. \r\n\r\nThis is Cesar's fifth loan with MFP, and is happy to know that he will have financial support and feels secure continuing with his work.

The inhabitants of Nazca are very generous and hospitable people.  This city has a cultural heritage that we, as Peruvians, are very proud of because this is where the Nazca lines are found. They were drawn in a big field and were used by the Nasca culture for farming. They were a type of calendar where the people could figure out when the rainy season would be. These majestic lines attract a great number of tourists. \r\n\r\nPeru is well-known for its exquisite food, but the dish that Elizabeth likes the most is \u201cAji de Gallina\u201d (chile chicken).

Since Claudio\u2019s move to the United States 20 years ago, he has worked on farms in upstate New York and found seasonal employment at different factories during the winter months. Fascinated by the variety of produce that is grown in the U.S., Claudio made a decision seven years ago to rent land and start a farm of his own farm \u2013 sustained with support from the Grow NYC New Farmer Development program.  \n\nWhen Hurricane Irene swept through upstate New York \u2013 devastating crops from Claudio's farm \u2013 it was his loyal Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members that took immediate action to save his business. By collectively pooling their savings, Claudio\u2019s CSA was able offset lost income and monetary damages and kept Claudio\u2019s farm from going under. This demonstration of un-coerced, homegrown support is no less organic than the farm fresh vegetables Claudio has been selling for over seven years. With a variety of over 50 types of vegetables sold at six different markets throughout New York City, Claudio has amassed a dedicated following of patrons that can quickly discern the quality of Claudio\u2019s produce. \n\nIn 2011, Claudio searched for loan capital to help cover the cost of his next batch of seedlings for the spring, but like other immigrant entrepreneurs, a short credit history made it challenging for him to secure funding for his business. As a member of Grow NYC, Claudio attended a financing workshop on Dec. 1 and met ACCION USA Business Development Officer Erica Dorn, who saw potential in Claudio\u2019s business. \u201cI really saw some strengths in Claudio, particularly with his business momentum and strong CSA relationships,\u201d said Erica. Looking beyond Claudio\u2019s credit score, ACCION USA approved a microloan for seedlings, helping Claudio to stabilize his business during tough winter months.        \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":119.44,"image":{"id":980281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seedlings for Spring planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New York","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2130,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":118.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":119.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263226696,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T00:01:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380479,"name":"Luis Heriberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Luis Heribrto es un hombre trabajador y emprendedor quien es docente en un colegio de Niquinomo desde hace varios a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casado con la se\u00f1ora Bertha con la que tiene 4 hijos por los cuales trabajan arduamente.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo utilizara para mejoras en su hogar para realizar un sumidero (en lugares donde no llegan las tuberias de aguas negras las personas realizan sumideros para el desag\u00fce). \n","en":"Luis Heriberto is a hardworking and enterprising man who has been a teacher at a high school in Niquinomo for several years.

If Oscar has to carry something that is very heavy, he has to hire a vehicle that transports him for $30 dollars.  He is charged more for the trip when he has lots of products.\r\n\r\nOscar is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy more pigs to raise, and later sell at a good price.

Nazca is a city whose inhabitants are very generous and hospitable. It has a cultural heritage: as Peruvians, we are very proud of this city since it has the Nazca Lines. They were drawn over extensive fields and were used by the Nazca culture in its agriculture; they are a type of calendar whereby one could determine when the rainy season might arrive. Because of these majestic lines, the city welcomes an infinity of tourists every year. \r\n\r\nMarcial only studied up to the 6th grade of primary. His parents had few economic resources. He would have liked to study music in a center or specialized school, since music is his life and his work tool. \r\n\r\nMarcial is an example of struggle, evidence that when one desires to get ahead, come what may, it can be achieved. Some years ago, Marcial suffered a terrible accident while traveling with his wife. She lost her life and he nearly became blind; he still has very poor vision. As a result, he was left a widower with a son to care for but he has advanced despite adversity. This demonstrates that, at times, we lack awareness that there are people who need more help than we do. With effort and dedication, and especially, much love of life, he struggles every day without tiring or giving up.\r\n\r\nAt present, Marcial is committed to the music business, composing, especially, Peruvian folkloric music. He also performs his music at events and concerts which he presents throughout his city, which he does very well, despite his limited vision. He travels to diverse parts of the city to give his concerts, and does so alongside his faithful companion, friend and right hand, his son, who would give his life and struggle against all and everyone, to see his father happy. Marcial works around 15 hours a week, depending on how many events he schedules. They usually occur on weekends. Marcial earns around 700 new sols a week and in a good week he can earn up to 1,500 new sols. He comments that his business is doing well because God is on his side every day, as He was at the time of the accident, since Marcial is alive and can care for his son who at that time was very small; also because despite not seeing very well, he can play music with feeling and, therefore, very beautifully. Also, he is much appreciated by his clients and they often recommend him owing to his good work and punctuality.\r\n\r\nMarcial gives thanks to God and to Kiva investors for the help he has received, since thanks to them, he can now make a publicity video to deliver to Peru's TV networks. With that, he will become known at the national level and give more monthly concerts and earn more income, enabling him to continue saving to achieve his dream: to travel to Cuba for an operation to recover his sight, then continue struggling for a good life and, most of all, to see his son become a professional that he can be proud of.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83,"image":{"id":980736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to make a publicity video to promote his musical career.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T01:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcial","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":112.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":119.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":123.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":129.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":139.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":145.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":151.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":158},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":164.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":108.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":109.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142581,"comment":null},{"amount":42.3,"local_amount":112.79,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":113.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271208,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T07:02:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380509,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlinda is 38 years old, married, and has one child.

She is the mother of three children, whose ages are 6, 17, and 19. The youngest is in the first year of education. The two oldest, whom she has raised with much effort, study at the university. Doris likes to prepare sweets and cook in her free time. For that reason, she always prepares her favorite dish, which is \"chicken with rice.\" She tells us that her children love her way of cooking. For that reason, she would have liked to study gastronomy, but because of her parents' limited economic resources, she was not able to do it. Thus she struggles every day so that her children can have careers, and she won't rest until this is achieved.\r\n\r\nDoris now has her own business where she sells groceries, clothing, soft drinks, and beer. She works about 12 hours every day and waits on 15 to 20 customers in a day. She can earn up to 40 PEN, and on a very good day she can earn up to 60 PEN. She believes that her business does well because she offers good service to her customers. \r\n\r\nDoris is very thankful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business (groceries and sample clothing for ordering), and with it she will have a greater variety of products and greater income, so that she can continue saving to be able to fulfill her most desired dream: to have her children have successful careers and to improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":30.35,"image":{"id":980743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy merchandise (groceries and clothing) for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":75.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":78.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":87.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":91.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.35,"local_amount":75.87,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":81.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271209,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T08:48:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380511,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 32 years old and married.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGliceria operates a variety store. In the Philippines a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGliceria hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":513.33,"image":{"id":980845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gliceria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":280,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12317.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146161,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10264.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T20:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380528,"name":"Lisbeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lisbeth is from Carmen Annex, Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental.

is a 19-year-old woman living in the town of Salelologa.

Although this is not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables to sell. Kimberly has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 450 Samoa talas (WST) (approximately $280 USD) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Kimberly joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and gain the ability to engage in business activities. Kimberly requested her first loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase chemicals such as Gramoxome. The loan will be the first loan taken out by Kimberly from SPBD. Kimberly plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her

Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Wilma is requesting a PHP26, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWilma hopes to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

is Merlita, 42, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Jesus, an Aircon technician, and mother of two children. By the grace of God, Merlita has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMerlita operates a business selling sugar. What she basically does is buy sacks of sugar from wholesalers, repack them and sell them per kilo to individuals, general store owners, and the local community. Sugar is repacked in \u00bc, 1\/2, and 1 kilo packages. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more sugar to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMerlita dreams to be able to give all of her children a high quality education through her hard work on her business.
