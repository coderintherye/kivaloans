It is made up of 13 members who are from the community of Nueva Imperial, located 20 minutes from the city of Temuco. Their businesses are, primarily, the sale of silver jewelry, used clothing, natural products (like snail cream and soaps), creation of artisan products, preparation of fast food, sale of plastics, of chocolates, a call center, and a candy shop.\r\n\r\nThe group member interviewed was Idelia, who is the group\u2019s president. In the picture you see her in the first row, to the left with short gray hair.\r\nIdelia has a call center from which she also sells sweets and general goods. Her shop is located in the center of Nueva Imperial, and she has had this business for approximately 8 years. She will invest this loan in paint to refinish the outside of her business, and into a few display cases to show her products. She likes for her business to be well-kept, so she does not like to go very long without touching up the paint and displays. This is necessary because she has a lot of competition. She also plans to put part of the loan into merchandise such as cell phone re-charge cards, sweets, diapers, razors, and deodorants.\r\n\r\nIdelia\u2019s goals are to add on to her home and to buy a car, and she is currently saving for these projects. Her motivation is her 22-year-old daughter who is attending university and studying sociology. What Idelia has enjoyed the most about working with Fondo Esperanza is sharing experiences with her group because they have created strong connections and friendship between them.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna.

In thinking about her future and her family's future, Reynalda would like to initiate another business like the purchase of grains and cereals so her earnings and her savings can be put towards her children's education.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Gustavo  Gutierrez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":552710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prudencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reynalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eydee Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8400,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1399.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1399.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1399.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1400.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1399.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1399.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":495.83,"local_amount":1399.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T07:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152158274,"comment":null},{"amount":495.82,"local_amount":1399.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159629989,"comment":null},{"amount":495.83,"local_amount":1399.98,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844035,"comment":null},{"amount":495.87,"local_amount":1400.1,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-23T08:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110213,"comment":null},{"amount":495.82,"local_amount":1399.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403462,"comment":null},{"amount":495.83,"local_amount":1399.98,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-25T03:08:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207057,"name":"Togetherness Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kumba N., who is holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called Togetherness.

For more than a year and a half she has run a store where she sells basic products such as sugar, oil, salt, eggs, soft drinks and candy. She also sells tortillas. She is very dynamic and hard-working and because of this she is well-known in her neighbourhood. This is helpful, since her customers know where to find her. She is trying to expand her business, and when her customers request new items she tries to get them to satisfy her customers. For example, she also sells gifts for different occasions as they are requested. She has demonstrated herself to be a very responsible woman, as she has been very punctual with her payments during her time with FAPE. She says she is very happy because she has many plans that she wants to achieve, so she is requesting this loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nMaria Eduarda Garcia, another group member, sells tortillas, eggs, sausages, spicy pork sausages, tomatoes and other products that her customers request. She has five children and tells us how she is working hard to expand her business in order to, along with her husband, offer her children an education; they all go to school.

She started off as a street vendor with only 5 chickens in the Ci\u00e9nega San Raymundo village. Soon the women in the village were looking to buy from her, so her father gave her a small capital and encouraged her to go to another town called Ciudad Quetzasell to sell in greater quantities. Ang\u00e9lica has 4 children who study in the village primary school and her husband is a bricklayer. Her dream is to own a shop in the town market to increase sales and improve profits. \r\n\r\nIsabel M. has a shop in her own home. She has 6 children, 5 of them married and a 14 year old daughter who lives with her and attends the local school. With the help of Isabel's husband the shop has been doing well. She needs a loan to purchase a fridge, because the lack of it prevents her from offering refrigerated products such as dairy produce, cold lemonades, ice-creams, cold meats, etc.    \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela T. sells chickens from her shop in the Villas del Quetzal neighborhood.

The other members make embroidered blouses as well as woven sashes.  \r\n<p>\r\nOlga needs to expand her business as a result of great demand, which is why she is requesting another loan.  These women have had several loans with FAPE and repaid them successfully.  The loan they requested will be used to buy clothing to expand Olga\u2019s business as well as acquire more yarn for producing embroidered and woven clothing.  They dream of having a store where customers can find them and they can grow their businesses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The group consists of nine members. \r\n\r\nCamila A. is a member of the group.  She is 48 years old and only has a grade school education. She makes clay pots. She has dedicated herself to pottery for 15 years, as it is a family tradition.  Her mom taught her the trade when she lost her job as a domestic servant.  She lives with her mom and her brother.  She asks for the loan to be able to buy raw materials to use to make pots.  She sells the pots without kilning them, and as she has no vehicle to transport her product, she only sells to her neighbors.  Her dream is to construct a room with plate to be able to store her pots as the rainy season is approaching.\r\n\r\nThe name of the members of the group and their job are:\r\n\r\nIGNACIA S.

Her son Sebastian is 4 years old.  They live in the town of Quimbiri, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they rent a house.  Marisabel is practical and determined.  Despite the fact that she had problems with her husband at that time, she decided to leave her homeland of Huanuco in search of new horizons and emotional stability in her life. Now she enjoys her life to the fullest.  She is a professor at a Centro Superior (university), work that gives her much satisfaction since her pupils are well motivated in class. She works from early in the morning until 1:00 in the afternoon and spends the rest of the day teaching private classes. This helps her financially since it is income she receives in addition to her monthly salary. She has spent 4 years working so she knows that she is not going to remain dependent all of her life. That is why later she plans to open a shop selling clothes in order to improve the quality of life for herself and her family. This is her third loan with MFP, and she is committed to continue making her payments.  She is also confident that she will reach her maximum potential with her communal group as it provides many advantages.

Her life may be poor yet, being blessed with a very loving and supportive husband and children, any trials and problems she encounters in her everyday life seemed to be easy to overcome.

Nally believes that everything she dreams of for herself and family will eventually come true. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith that approach, through her, her family enjoys the opportunity ASHI has given them. Loans she has been receiving have enabled them to start their own income generating activities. They were able to purchase a motorcycle and a second-hand sidecar for a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) which is for her husband\u2019s transportation business. Nally also has her own salt buying and selling business. Large volumes of salt are sold in the market and during the town\u2019s market day when may people and small entrepreneurs come from other municipalities to buy different commodities for personal consumption and business. Nally sells her salt wholesale.\r\n\r\nProceeds of Nally's and her husband\u2019s businesses are the sole source of income for their family. As parents, they are also supporting the needs of their two children who are 19 and 24. Once Nally has the capability to open a saving fund, she will be motivating her children to go back to college as they are just high school graduates.

Their younger child is currently going to school and also helps in the business as part of its daily chores while their older child has work elsewhere.\r\n\r\nZenaida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 1992 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fish vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of P13,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nZenaida is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of P12,000 was used to fund operations of her fish-vending business and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing P15,000 for her 18th loan which she intends to use in her fish-vending business.\r\n\r\nZenaida is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Amelia has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,200 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Amelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Amelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional equipment and tools such as needles and threads. Amelia is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Amelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Her income, however, is not enough to live a comfortable life. Since she has been widowed, she receives no additional financial help in her household. She has two sons: one in college and the other in high school.\r\n\r\nSaltanat, though, is a strong woman and has taken care of the necessities by filling up her day up with other activities like cattle breeding, which she has now been doing for four years. She started cattle breeding with an initial investment of 5,000 KGS and now makes a 3,000 KGS monthly profit. She plans to use this loan to purchase a personal computer for her younger son to use in school.\r\n\r\nSaltanat\u2019s longer term plans are to increase the number of cattle on her farm and to contribute money to her elder son\u2019s wedding.\r\n\r\nSaltanat has three partners:\r\n\r\nBaktygul A., 42, is the treasurer of the group. She is also in the business of purchasing cattle and reselling them after fattening. She has been doing this for three years, ever since she divorced and her friends suggested she start this business. She began with a 10,000 KGS investment and today makes a 4,000 KGS monthly profit. With the loan, Baktygul wants to purchase four cows to increase her turnover.\r\n\r\nFarhat A. is an impressive 22-year old. He successfully graduated from second year at the university and, in order to do this, had to take out a loan. To pay off his loan he began selling cattle, fish, and agricultural products. He started this business one year ago with 5,000 KGS and now makes a 4,000 KGS profit. He would like another loan to buy more cattle and increase the amount of his herd. His future plans are to graduate, to marry, and to find a good job.\r\n\r\nSabira B., 69, wants to have enough money to support her daughter and grandchildren. Her daughter is 25 and works in a nursery, earning 5,000 KGS per month. Sabira looks after her grandchildren and breeds cattle. She is a widow and, following her neighbors\u2019 advice, began to breed cattle with an initial investment of 10,000 KGS. Now she makes 1,500 KGS per month. She would like to use the loan to purchase hay for her cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1.626.900 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women which was used to repair a transport vehicL. used in the business. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide cargo transport services.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

As a woman who does not like to depend on her husband for all the family needs and finding it so difficult to accomplish this task, Rose N.  joined GHAPE in 1998. Also, she has been having a lot of marital problems with her family.This has made her sad all the time but she is appreciative of the fact that she is alive. Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small to her children. Her inability to get investment capital which could constantly generate income for her to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\n\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy a two-wheeled motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she has a good rider for the motorcycle. She  plans to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school and to cater for the basic needs of her family.  \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community in its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy seeds and fertilizer to sow for a good harvest so that he can take care of his children and his home.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.

Abdul is 41 years old and married.  He has five children between the ages of 3 and 16 years old.  His oldest four children go to school.  Abdul also supports his 20-year-old sister-in-law, who lives with the family.  Abdul started selling used clothing about ten years ago, and with the help of past loans from Tujijenge Tanzania, he now focuses on selling second-hand shoes.  Abdul has repaid all of his loans, and his business is going well.  He earns a profit of about US$ 150 per month.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul plans to buy about 50 pairs of second-hand shoes for his shop.  He will select men's and women's shoes, sandals and boots.  With the profits, Abdul will continue to support his family and pay for food and school fees.  He hopes to reinvest additional savings into his business, and eventually open up a second location in the busy Kariako market of Dar Es Salaam. \r\n\r\nAbdul is the chairman of the Mpapai group.  The group's 17 members run a variety of businesses including salons, shops, tailoring, and charcoal sales.  The group's members will hold each other accountable for repaying this loan.  \r\n\r\nIn the photo, Abdul is standing 3rd from the right, wearing a white shirt.

Fred, a 38-year-old happy-go-lucky married man with seven children, is an evergreen optimist who carries conviction that the decisions one takes in the early stages of a business are the springboard to its success. It is a gospel he has preached \u2013 and he gladly practiced it at the start of his produce-selling business thirty years ago.

is a 23 year old single man from Lebanon.  Since 2007, he has been working in the construction industry. He specializes in installing and repairing tiles, as well as polishing them. This type of business is very common in Lebanon. Ibrahim is known for his good work and is proud of his experience. He is able to serve several clients at the same time.  His clients can be anyone from his region and its surroundings. His challenge is the competition since it is a demanding work. When he first started, Ibrahim had difficulty making himself known to the public, but through his determination and hard work, he was able to build a network of clients. Ibrahim is requesting from Al Majmoua, a Kiva partner, a loan to purchase a new tile polishing machine. He hopes to continue to grow and enhance his business in the coming year. This will be his first loan from Al Majmoua.

He is 26 and single, and so he presently lives with his parents in Kicukiro. He finished his studies up to 5th grade (primary school). He has been a client of ACB since 2007 and has already taken out and reimbursed more than 10 loans. \r\n\r\nHe works for a construction company as a gardener and has an experience of 7 years in this work. A very serious young man, he puts aside savings out of his little salary, which have permitted him to build a house that he rents out for additional income.  \r\n\r\nRight now, he is requesting a loan of 320,000 Rwandan Francs (FRW) to embellish the house by buying cement and sand to protect the outside of the house from rainwater. He has also bought plyboard to build a ceiling for the house. Moreover, he has bought electric wire and paid for installing electricity in the house, which did not have electricity before. All these improvements make the house worth more so that he can get more in rent. In the future, he intends to continue constructing a wall around it so it will bring in even more. \r\n\r\nWith the additional savings that he will be able to put aside between the rent and his salary, he hopes to be able to set himself up in the country, one of these days, and raise cattle. He also wants to marry when his means permit him to support a family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is 29 and her family came back to their homeland in 1995. At that time she was 13. She now has only her mother since her father died in 2000. She has a secondary school diploma in accounting.  \r\n\r\nYvonne works in a construction firm as a bookkeeper, and she has three years' experience in this job. She has been putting aside savings with Amasezerano since 2009, and she is now requesting her first loan with the intention of paying the fees for her second academic year, since she would like to get a Bachelor's degree in management. She is taking out a loan of 400000 Francs Rwandais (Rwandan Francs). \r\n\r\nYvonne wants to work hard and diligently so that she will succeed in her studies and be able to continue with her third year. With her savings, she will soon be able to open a mini-mart or a little currency exchange booth. \r\n\r\nIn the long run, her ambition is to become a well-known economist in her country. If she can do that and can find a job, she will be able to support her family in all regards.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":553250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"pay the fees for her university courses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kicukiro-Kigali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T07:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yvonne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151836785,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577522,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101386.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172057551,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177348847,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182483840,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188618619,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50693.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T09:46:04Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:15:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207333,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is married with five children.

However, he now has his own enterprise:  a phone call service that he located on a street near his mother\u2019s beauty salon entrance.  It is in the busy Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar neighborhood, just south of Barranquilla.\n\nHis business allows him to pay for his own expenses to become a pharmacist, and not have to depend on his mother for his education.  This affords him the opportunity to live a healthy and pleasant social life with his girlfriend, without being a financial burden on his family.\n\nThis year, he has received 2 loans from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  Currently, he is requesting 1,300,000 Colombian pesos to invest in modernizing his cellular equipment and to supply his business with phone covers and other supplies to sell.  His dream is to also have his own pharmacy, since in 6 months he will have attained all the legal requirements to be a pharmacist.  For these reasons, he puts forth a great effort as a hard-working student to complete his goal.\n\nHis great challenge is to practice excellent professionalism, so that he can return all the support that his family has provided.  His mother, sister and aunt have especially helped him out, particularly when he\u2019s had to be absent in order to complete his studies.\n\nJulio Cesar is a 21-year old young man who is very mature

She lives alone with her two small children in her own house.\r\n\r\nFor six years she has been growing coffee, bananas, corn, and citrus fruits on her own fields.  She also has some rented fields.  She works with the help of workers who keep the fields on her farm cleared.  That way she is able to get her harvest on time.\r\n\r\nShe learned farming techniques thanks to her father\u2019s lessons.  He did not want his daughter dependent upon any man.  What she likes most about her occupation is selling the harvests in the markets in the city where she lives.  She saves the money that she earns.  With effort she bought the possessions that she now has.  As an enterprising woman she plans to later plant a greater quantity of coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

walked past a shabby hair salon in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District almost every day for twelve years without giving it a second glance; it was a far cry from the spaces where she worked as a hair stylist.\n\nOver the years, Georgia has paid other business owners considerable monthly fees to rent chairs in their plush salons. Last year she grew tired of sharing her earnings with salons that did not share her vision. She declared, \u201cI want do something innovative, fun and my own\u2026it is my turn.\u201d\n\nOne day, rather than just passing by the shabby hair salon, Georgia marched in and asked to buy the space. From this bold move, \u201cPretty Pretty Collective\u201d was born.\n\nIt is no secret that Georgia loves to create fantasy and imagery. She grew up in England and Canada, left home when she was 14, and has been styling and modeling ever since. Georgia\u2019s vision for \u201cPretty Pretty Collective\u201d is to create an imaginative venue where she can style clients during the day.\n\nIn addition to serving her own client base, Georgia will proudly rent out the space to five other stylists who share her passion and her vision. To help keep overhead costs low and to maximize the real estate, at night the space will transform into a setting for art shows and fundraisers featuring local artists and popular neighborhood vendors. She hopes to host a fundraiser for her son\u2019s school, which, like other schools across California, faces serious budget cuts.\n\nUpon purchasing the salon space last year, a friend referred her to the small business section in City Hall where she found Women\u2019s Initiative for Self Employment, and Opportunity Fund. Georgia will use this $10,000 loan from Opportunity Fund to become an authorized vendor of the Bumble and Bumble product lines and to purchase salon furniture.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5536.45,"image":{"id":553394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Their businesses are, primarily, selling dried fruits and nuts, used clothing, vegetables and salads, desserts, and doing sewing.\r\n\r\nThe group member interviewed was Edith, who is the group\u2019s president.  In the photo she is pictured in the third row on the left, wearing a gray sweater over a red shirt.  From her home she runs a business selling pinecones and firewood.  \r\n\r\nEdith posts advertisements in places like schools and restaurants around her community.  After the forests around Temuco are cut for timber there are many pieces of wood and pinecones left, so she pays people to go in and collect this for her.  She has been doing this business for approximately three years. Edith will invest this loan in a chainsaw because she and her husband also cut wood themselves.\r\n\r\nEdith\u2019s greatest motivation is to maintain the health and well-being of her family, especially of her three children who are 15, 11, and 10, because with only her husband\u2019s income they are unable to make ends meet. She is content working with Fondo Esperanza, because it has been a great support for her and for her business.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal

The loan she is seeking will be used to purchase an additional quantity of fruits and vegetables that she will be transporting to another location for sale at the city fair.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":553474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"Purchase of fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":59.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673427,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":59.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887250,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":59.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154259,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":59.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449567,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":118.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588255,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T13:53:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207427,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria tuvo 9 hijos, ahora solo vive con su esposo y un nieto que esta a su responsabilidad y estudia en la universidad.\nMaria venD. ropa a pedido, negocio que realiza con la ayuda e sus hijas que trabajan en la selva a quienes env\u00eda la ropa y en algunas oportunidades viaja llevando sus productos.

G. is a widow who supports her family with her general store and hog raising business. She lives in Hda. Isabel, La Castellana, Negros Occidental with her 4 children who are 26,28,30 and 33.\n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of Php6,000.\n\nLorna is now borrowing Php29,500 so that she could expand her working capital. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of Php20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lorna aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

They live in the city of Cuenca. This city was declared a World Heritage Site on the December 1, 1999, for its architectural beauty and the four rivers that flow through the city. Its people are what make it special because they are polite and kind.\n\nSra. Rosa Silvana L. lives in the city of Cuenca. She is in her fourth loan cycle. Her mother invited her to be part of this group of hard-working women. The loans have benefited her in the raising of chickens, which she raises as an equal partner with her mother. She also works in her family's weaving shop, where she works from Monday to Friday.\n\nSra. Silvana studies through distance learning and is in her sixth year. She is 20 years old and lives in with her common law husband. She is happy because she is in her fifth month of pregnancy with her first child. She lives in the house of her parents, whom she helps economically since her parents do not have their own home and are renting one. She will invest her new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir in the purchase of chickens to sell to obtain income for her family. She wants to continue studying at the university and some day to be a medical professional, since that has been her dream since she was a girl.\n\nThis is the first loan for Se\u00f1ora Laura M.. She was invited by her sister, who is also a member of this foundation. She lives in the city of Cuenca, in the Three Bridges district. At this time she is raising guinea pigs, which she sells from her house. In the past, she sewed jeans, but unfortunately she could not continue working because of the stress. Sra. Laura is 52 years old. She has been a widow for 21 years. Her husband died of cancer. She has 6 children. Four of them are married and live independently. One daughter emigrated to another country, but she does not receive any help from her. Her last son works, and everything he earns goes to pay his own expenses. This bank member has her own house thanks to her sacrifice and work. Her loan will be invested in the construction of a cage so that she can raise more guinea pigs. Her goal is to continue working to increase her business.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":553662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy chickens, construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Silvana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1430,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":178.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":536.25,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632926,"comment":null},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":536.25,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846960,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":362.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113420,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-04T07:52:16Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207488,"name":"Edna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edna P. is a married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: rice retailing and pig fattening.

The extra income from the sale of milk will assist her to pay school fees for her children and improve their health and standard of living.
