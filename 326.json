This is three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in agriculture and with livestock since he was very small.  He raises dairy cows on the fields surrounding his house.

There she offers a diverse range of products to her customers, specifically chicken and vegetables. She told us the idea for the business was suggested because no one on the street sold chicken in that area and her neighbors had to go to the city of Paij\u00e1n to buy it. She started selling only chicken  but soon her neighbors suggested she start selling vegetables and since then she has maintained her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAdditionally, she works as an asparagus harvester in nearby fields but this activity doesn\u2019t provide stable income with which she can help her family.

At this time his wife is working in Spain, so he is caring for his children by himself.   He is a very responsible person.  Even though he had the opportunity to work in Spain with his wife, they decided that he should stay with his children.  He sells raw milk to a processing plant that uses it to manufacture milk products.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be used to build a stable to protect his livestock now that the rainy season is beginning.\r\n\r\nHis dreams and goals include: for his children to receive an education and become working professionals; to increase his milk production; build an addition to his home; and most importantly for his wife to return so that they can all be together again. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

As for the competitive environment, the members are highly competitive in their marketplace since they are the only ones offering their products and services; and thanks to their experience, they know how much business they need to do on a daily basis to budget for their supplies.  \r\n\r\nThe members plan to use their loan to increase capital.  They'll buy supplies for the higher-volume days, more powerful stoves so they can work more efficiently, and they'll also improve their stands for their clients' convenience.  The rest of the members will buy merchandise wholesale.  The group is on its third loan cycle and the members are demonstrating a great desire to work and succeed through their responsibility and effort.  That's why Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital is providing them renewed financial support, so they can keep growing and strengthening their businesses.

Four of her children help her financially. A lack of financing has kept her from expanding her business. She sews for her customers and makes clothes to sell, but in small quantities. When she started, she had the support of her mother, and acquired experience alongside her, which she appreciates as it allowed her to gain experience in order to work, and she likes the advantages of being able to care for her children and work at the same time.\r\nWith this loan, she will be able to put up partitions in her house, as there is currently no privacy, which has been uncomfortable for her at times. Because she didn't have much money, she could not do this work on her house; it is only through this loan that she is able to make improvements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristen Jancuk Beck, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":450582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T20:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":700.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":728.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841509,"comment":null},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":676.7,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":703.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874432,"comment":null},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":669.46,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":695.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604311,"comment":null},{"amount":33.61,"local_amount":672.23,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":698.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639775,"comment":null},{"amount":33.59,"local_amount":671.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":698.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821558,"comment":null},{"amount":33.77,"local_amount":675.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":702.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561565,"comment":null},{"amount":33.38,"local_amount":667.54,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":694,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770500,"comment":null},{"amount":33.5,"local_amount":670.06,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":696.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204394,"comment":null},{"amount":29.81,"local_amount":596.14,"processed_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":619.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330115,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T01:28:07Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":162991,"name":"G.s.

She is 48 years old and for the past 20 years she has run a small home-based grocery store.  She has accomplished this with the help of her husband and with financing from Afodenic, which has allowed her to invest in a variety of merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a construction worker.  They have five children, three of them are adults and two are students.  Her earnings have allowed her to make improvements to their home.  She recently had it painted so that it would look nicer and so that customers would be more attracted to her store.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money from this loan in basic items, such as: rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, soap, toothpaste, canned sardines, tuna, Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, chicken, meats, and milk products in order to satisfy the needs of her customers, as these are the things that they use daily.\r\n\r\nShe has used her past loans to increase her inventory and sales.  She hopes to do so this season, as her sales have been a bit low.

She extracts the water from a well that her grandparetns dug on the property where she lives.  She sells at a reasonable price and people always come to her.  In fact, even when water supplies are cut in her district, neighbors come to her home to request water.  She also earns income by providing cleaning services to some institutions in the area.  During the day, she divides her time between these locations and even some private homes that have requested her services.  These two activities produce her only source of income to support her family.  Fanny has worked with Kiva in the past and she is very grateful to Kiva donors who have supported her.  During the past few months she has been saving money to make one of her dreams come true:  to build her house.  Construction has begun but she needs additional funds to finish the roof on a bedroom.

She does many things such as sewing, raising animals and farming, which is the job that occupies most of her time; above all, when the planting and harvesting season approaches.

She feels that her work is worthwhile when she sees her crops have been fruitful and she can sell the entire crop successfully in the market place near her neighborhood. Among all the most lucrative products that she plants is corn and beans. For this reason, she's analyzing the possibility of increasing her land holdings.

B. is from the village of Puntod Lopez Jaena Misamis Occidental.

Jejie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jejie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jejie is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jejie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the primary needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This loan will be her 4th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to support the school expenditures of her student child.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She is 31 years old, married and the mother of 3 children and one stepson who are 14, 12, 5 and 2 years old. The two oldest are in school. She only went to school until the 6th grade due to her parents lack of financial resources. She owns the house where she lives with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n<p>\r\nShe left the Chokwe District to go to Matola with her parents due to the destabilization war of 1983. In 1999, she left with her parents to Boane in order to establish the home where they now live. She has had her own business for over 20 years. She learned the businees from her mother in Matola when she was 10 years old. She works around 10 hours a day. She has no employees and makes around 7.000.00mt a month which goes towards house expenses and savings. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She came to know Hluvuku through community leadership during mobilization meetings. This loan, in the amount of 8.000.00mt, is her fourth. She intends to purchase supplies (beans, eggs, flour and others) to increase her inventory. The previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 8.000.00mt and 11.000.00mt and were used in housing and her business. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her construction and offer better living conditions to her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

She is 29 years old and a single mother to a boy who's 10 months old. She finished 12th grade but had to drop school due to financial difficulties. She lives in her own house with her son and doesn't support anyone else. She never left Maputo. She runs her own business selling beer, wine and soft drinks for the past 10 years. She learned this activity from her parents, she has no employees and works from 7AM to 6PM every day.\r\nShe makes around 2.500,00MT (U$80) per month which she uses for household expenses and saves some every month. She has never had loans with other banks and this is her 3rd loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 10.000,00MT (U$350) in order to buy more merchandise (soft drinks, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages) to diversify her products and improve her business. Her previous loans were also for $350 and for the same reason. She is hoping to pay this one in time like she did with the others so in the future she can ask for another loan to open her own liquor store and improve her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She found out about Hluvuku through a friend who's also a client. \r\nThis is her third loan in the amount of 10.000,00MT (U$350) that she'll use to buy more food products (chicken, fish, meat, soft drinks, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages) to diversify what she sells and improve her business. Her other loans were for the same purpose.\r\nOne of Paula's dreams is to buy a tilting carriage in order to carry sand and rocks and sell it around.

He heard of Hluvuku from a friend who's also a client and this is his 3rd loan in the amount of 10.000,00MT (U$350) that he'll use to buy construction supplies to build a wall in his house. His previous loans were for 2.500MT and 8.000MT for the same purpose.\r\nIn the future Cornelio hopes to get more loans to buy a motor pump for his machamba (a large garden where crops are grown that provide most all the food for the people in the villages) and to finish building his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She has had a boutique in Jinja for over 15 years selling new clothes like gomesi (colorful full-length dress), bitenge (similar to sarongs), and casual wear. Although she says that she has challenges, like transportation costs and inconsistency in the quality clothes, she is able to make a 150,000 profit per week. This is attributed to her good customer care skills and the availability of stock due to her loans. She hopes to become a wholesale supplier and build a house for her children as their mother. She needs loans for business growth, because they help her have a steady supply of products and school fees.

She has been living for about 15 years in the neighborhood of Gankpodo in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. She is married to Lavenir Ahoton and hasn't yet any children. Marguerite lives with her husband and helps him with the family expenses. She did not attend school.\r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Marguerite sells kitchen utensils (cool boxes, sets of bowls, plastic pails, sets of saucepans, etc.) as well as cloths. She sells her products through the distribution system. She gets her supplies from Lom\u00e9 in Togo, a country adjoining Benin, as well as from Dantokpa, the international market of Benin. She has been in this business for seven years. This is her sixth loan from Alid\u00e9. She is a reliable client who repays her loans on schedule. Marguerite wants to increase her working capital and bolster her activity. Therefore she came to Alid\u00e9 and applied for her sixth loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Abdumavlon's dream is for all of his children to be well-educated. He is working hard to realize it. As a result, his business generates a significant income, allowing him to support his large family. In order to provide better service to his clients and, thus, to earn more, Abdumavlon needs to make major repairs to his lorry. He believes that this will make his business more profitable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

For this reason, he goes out every morning to graze his animals so they can eat. He enjoys caring for his animals, because thanks to this business he can take a meal to his children. Shamsiddin\u2019s family is his greatest love and they are the biggest motivators in his life. The loan he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of young sheep, which will help to improve his business and help him become the best breeder in his area. With your help, this will be possible.\r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Oisha is 50 years old and is an admirable mother. Together with her husband (pictured), she has shown a great, diligent spirit and enthusiasm for agricultural work. This activity has let them educate their children. Oisha continues to strive towards providing well-being and education for her children and towards being able to cover the expenses that her delicate health requires every day. As a result of this, her work has been very limited, and her profits have decreased notably. Since Oisha now wishes to increase the quality of her products by purchasing fertilizers. Her goal is to obtain a larger income to keep providing her children with education and improve the living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 4,000 Somoni, which she will use to make her dreams a reality.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sohibnazar is 41 years old. He has a successful business selling flour at the local market in Kabodien region. Sohibnazar sells an assortment of good quality flours. In the picture you can see Sohibnazar with his guarantor of the loan. Because he buys the flour at wholesale, the price is cheaper than the price of his competitors. Thus, he has many customers who even make a purchase of his flour straight from his house. Today he has a great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. Sohibnazar has requested a loan of 13,000 Somoni to add to his working capital and allow him to purchase more inventory. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has worked hard to win his customers\u2019 trust. His major goal is to ensure that he is able to pay his children\u2019s school fees to the highest level of education.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They know each other through the neighborhood and through their businesses. This group of women sells a variety of articles and bakes a local type of bread known as \"Takoula\".\r\n\r\nHaving correctly repaid their previous 6 loans, they are requesting their 7th loan. They will use this loan to purchase 4 sets of curtains, 3 sets of cotton sheets, 10 sets of fancy \"pagnes\" (brightly colored cotton cloth), 4 sacks of millet, various condiments (notably: 1 crate of fresh tomatoes, 1\/2 a crate of large fresh hot peppers, 1\/2 a crate of peppers, 1 sack of powdered baobab tree leaves, 1 packet of maggi chicken stock cubes), 4 sacks of millet, 5 kilograms of wheat flour, 5 kilos of sugar, 4 packets of yeast, 6 kilos of ginger, 2 kilos of cooking salt and 250 grams of \"f\u00e8f\u00e8\" (a spice which can be used as a substitute for black pepper).\r\n\r\nThey will supply themselves with curtains, fabric and fancy \"pagnes\" from the market house of S\u00e9gou, for condiments they supply themselves from the weekly food market in S\u00e9gou, millet from Semembougou and the necessary ingredients for the preparation of \u2018\u2019Takoula\u2019\u2019 from the local stores. \r\n\r\nThe \u2018\u2019 Takoula\u2019\u2019 is made using a mixture of millet flour (10kg) and wheat flour (2kg), then they add some sugar, yeast, salt, ginger and \"f\u00e8f\u00e8\". They mix these ingredients with water until it is a dough; they leave it for a whole and then separate it into five balls and steam it in a pot. They mostly sell the product on Fridays. \r\n\r\nThey sell their items in the large market of S\u00e9gou, within the market house, from their homes and walking throughout the neighborhood. They sell their goods at retail for cash and credit to a clientele composed of men and women. They hope to realize a monthly income of 15,500 FCFA each, which they will use to repay Soro Yiriwaso for their loans and take care of family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":451067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase a variety of products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152471,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991310,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021585,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746375,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778916,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34113.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961133,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T21:39:12Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163202,"name":"Ti\u00e8ssiri Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Ti\u00e8ssiri est compos\u00e9 de quatre femmes (une veuve et 3 mari\u00e9es) ayant en moyenne 47 ans, 5 enfants et vivant majoritairement dans des familles monogames dans  le quartier Pelengana Extension de la ville de S\u00e9gou 4\u00e8me R\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali. \nElles se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de voisinage, de leurs activit\u00e9s commerciales et d\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une m\u00eame Association traditionnelle des femmes du dit quartier.\nDans le souci de p\u00e9renniser leurs activit\u00e9s commerciales, elles ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer le   programme cr\u00e9dit de l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso avec laquelle elles sont \u00e0 leur 7\u00e8me  pr\u00eat de groupe.

","en":"The community bank \"Agua Bella\" is represented by Olga and composed of 12 hard working partner members, as has been demonstrated in previous loan cycles.  Many of the members are neighbors from the same neighborhood or coworkers, so every member knows and trusts one another.  During their business activities, the partners use market stalls to sell products such as groceries, breakfasts, food, and various cosmetics; some partners devote themselves to the production of bread, wood furniture, and clothing items. In regards to the high level of competition with other businesses who sell the same range of products, the partners know that excellent customer service is makes a huge difference in selling more and obtaining higher sales than their competitors. The loan will be used for the acquisition of raw materials such as wood, cloth, flour, and sugar as well as the acquisition of work tools like a stove for the food sellers.  The rest of the loan money will be used for the purchase of merchandise which will allow the businesses to improve their income and enable the partners to give their families a higher quality of life.  In terms of their credit history, their partners are already in their third cycle and appreciate the confidence and the economic support that Agrocapital offers.  Thanks to them, the partners are able to continue growing and give their children a better future. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva

This bank was started in Cuenca, a beautiful city full of traditions and legends, with an incomparable natural beauty. \r\n\r\nMiss Casimira P. has been an active member of the Mujeres Floreciendo communal bank for the past 18 years; the easiness of payments and the multiple benefits she receives and her wishes for fulfillment created the incentive to be a part of the communal bank. \r\n\r\nOur partner lives in the El Paraiso community in the El Valle parish; she is 60 years old and has been divorced for 20 years because her husband abused her physically and psychologically. Out of this tumultuous relationship she conceived 13 children, three of which passed away due to the physical abuses. She doesn't remember the ages of her living children, but she knows that nine of them are married already and have their own families. Her only company is her last daughter who is already engaged, and two grandsons of 15 and 9 because their mother had to go abroad when her husband threatened to kill her. They rent a home because they don't own a house. \r\n\r\nCasimira is devoted to the sale of grain, vegetables, and plants from some patches in the free market of the city, and also sells animals that are raised for sacrifice. Her work schedule is from 6am to 6pm. She is satisfied with her accomplishments. With this new loan she will purchase peas, beans, tomato, onion and other vegetables as well as construction materials from a pig farm to start with her new pig business. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva

is divorced with three children.

This bank was started in Cuenca, a beautiful city that is rich in tradition and legend, with an incomparable natural beauty.  Olfa C. is an active member of the bank.  She lives in one the the most beautiful neighborhoods of Cuenca, Totoracocha.  She is 49 years old, separated from her husband for 16 years now, since he emigrated and was never heard from again.  He also didn't repay the debt he incurred for travel expenses forcing her to sell all she owned, including her lands and her house in Gualaceo; she's currently a renter.  The marriage produced 7 children, all of whom are now adults.  Four of them are married and three are single, but live independently, because she's now in a new relationship ,the fruit of which is a 9-year-old daughter.  However, they haven't forgotten their mother and they help her out economically with what little they can afford.  Olfa started her lunch business 6 months ago.  She tells us that she is doing well and acquiring regular customers.  However, she still needs certain items like pots, pans, ladles, and more kitchen utensils.  Her work day begins at 9am and goes until 2pm.  The rest of the day she takes in laundry to earn additional income for household expenses.  She has been working with the Foundation's credits for 4 years now, using them always to invest in her home.  The new financing will be used to buy pots, pans, ladles, tablecloths, etc. and whatever else she needs to equip her business so that it will grow and she can provide better customer service.  Her dream is to have her own house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":449473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy pots, pans, cutlery, tablecloths, ladles, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T00:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olfa Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680099,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680100,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074611,"comment":null},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910599,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946217,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946218,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674578,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674579,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708786,"comment":null},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708787,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T05:44:10Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163259,"name":"Claudia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Claudia es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cLupakas\u201d desD. hace 3 meses, vive en el distrito D.

She is a very happy and simple woman. She lives with her husband, Pedro, who is 41 years old, in their own home. What she wishes for the most is to improve her family's quality of life. For this, Ana has a small bakery, where she makes the tastiest and most delicious bread of the town of Taraco  (District of the province of Huancane). This is how her days begin very early: she prepares the dough and later she finishes by putting the bread in the oven. There are already a lot of customers who prefer to buy their bread from Ana, since the quality it's made with is unequaled. She has spent more than 7 years undertaking this activity and what she likes the most is the baking process because she feels like her work is accomplished. Getting up at dawn to finish her production every day, despite being very exhausting, fills her with satisfation. This is why she distributes her bread to the different points of sale. For this reason she wishes to have a store where she could sell the bread that she makes herself. This is her first loan with MFP and she is willing to make all of her payments on time, to be able to access new loans. In addition, she is considered to be very cheerful and supportive with the other members of her communal bank. With the thousand nuevos soles she is asking for, she will invest in the purchase of more ingredients to increase production of the bread that she makes herself.      <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":451248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more ingredients to make bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T02:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734961,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124284,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960025,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992870,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717657,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":165.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T04:01:55Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163283,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Leonarda es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSan Juan\u201d, vive en el distrito y provincia de Yunguyo, departamento de Puno.

is 33 years old. She lives with her son, daughter and husband in La Suiza de Turrialba, a rural region near the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Roxana\u00b4s completed primary school. The credit consultant who has been working with Roxana over the last few months describes her character as persevering, hardworking and strong.\r\n\r\nRoxana has developed her sales abilities by selling hand-made clothing, cosmetics, and various household items, to clients in her community in La Suiza de Turrialba. Going from door to door, Roxana provides her clients with four different catalogues to peruse, offering a range of personal and household products. Every 22 days, a representative from each catalogue company holds a meeting in the community to collect the orders from Roxana and other women. Within a week, the items are delivered to Roxana\u00b4s home, who then delivers the products to her clients. Many micro-entrepreneurs in Costa Rica make their living this way. \r\n\r\nRoxana launched her business with an investment of 25,000 colones that she used to purchase the catalogues. At the moment, she has 20 regular clients and hopes to use this loan to increase that number. She has been selling clothes for the past ten years. In a good month, she can earn 200,000 colones, in a bad month, only 140,000. Roxana started her business so she could contribute to family income and because she enjoys the work.\r\n\r\nAn obstacle for Roxana is the fixed margin imposed by the catalogue companies. Vendors are required to charge the price dictated by the catalogue. This strict regulation has hampered Roxanas ability to tailor prices to her client\u2019s needs, and thus limited her earnings. Roxana knows of a supplier in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, who offers better prices for products. She is applying for a loan from Fundacion Mujer to purchase more inventory items from this supplier. By travelling to San Jose once a week to purchase items, Roxana is confident she will be able to earn more profit from her sales as she will be able to dictate her margins and final prices. \r\n\r\nAlthough this will be her first loan with an official financial institution, Roxana has benefited from many loans from suppliers in the past who have not presented any negative references. Roxana has always enjoyed working in sales and earning her own source of income. Financial independence is something she values highly. Her goal is to open a clothing store. She wants her business to grow so that she can provide a higher standard of living for her family. She says \u00a8the money I earn is not for my husband, not for me, but for my family.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":451317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

A <i>take<\/i> is a measurement used by coca sellers and is equivalent to 50 pounds. Coca in its natural state has been valued in Bolivia since Incan times for its medicinal benefits. It is used in teas for stomachache and in creams for muscle pain. People who have jobs that require great physical exertion, such as miners, chew the leaves because they relieve fatigue and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe borrower buys coca brought from the Yungas region in the department of La Paz. All of the merchandise arrives at the coca market located in the Villa Fatima area. The owners are registered, and then they can sell it. The people who work in the coca business must have a special permit to sell this product. Lady has a permit because her father is from the Yungas region and so they have allowed her to work in this sector. She is a very responsible borrower. Her husband is a salaried driver and they both count on one another for household expenses. The loan she is asking for now is to increase the number of <i>takes<\/i> of coca, because towards the end of the year some merchants take a break and do not bring coca to sell. For this reason the price of a <i>take<\/i> of coca goes up.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about the coca leaf visit the following page:

She lives with her 38 year old husband, Eladio, and their two children, Elena, age 13, and Ever, age 7, in their own home. She is a fighter and although she only could finish primary school, she is prepared to work very hard to give her children a good education. Despite the climatic variations, Lidia leaves very early with her husband to obtain milk that the livestock farmers milked. She then prepares cheeses which are sold afterward in the Juliaca and Huancane markets. Lidia enjoys a lot about her work.  From doing this activity for over 10 years, she believes that the hardest part is obtaining the amount of milk needed to prepare the 30 cheeses that she produces daily.  What Lidia longs for the most is to have a very large store in the city Juliaca where she could sell her delicious cheeses with more ease. This is her first loan with MFP and she hopes not to miss payments of her fees. She also already feels committed to her other companions from her village bank.  With the thousand nuevos soles requested, she will increase her working capital so that she can purchase more milk and improve the tools with which she prepares her cheeses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elycia Mulholland, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":451517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more milk and tools to prepare cheeses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T23:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734966,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124292,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960033,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992878,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717665,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":165.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T01:48:23Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163332,"name":"Mariama Ba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mariama B\u00e2 D. est une femme de 38 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 05 enfants dont elle a la charge.

He usually offers services in the city of Cayalt\u00ed and the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nThe continual use seen by his vehicle and the poor condition of the roads in the area have meant that it is now having some mechanical problems. For this reason he has found it necessary to request for the first time a loan of 1000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa, which he plans to use to repair and maintain his vehicle.\r\n\r\nMarcial would like to start a livestock trading business in the future.

Married to Juan Apolonio B., they are blessed with nine children. Of the nine, three are already working, and six stay at home. Her husband works as a head of exploration in a mining company and they live in Caloocan City. In spite of the great size of her family, Mary Ann is a determined businesswoman. Her barbecue stand has been helping her family for three years as an added source of income. She became a member of the Center for Community Transformation* just this year, and has already received three loans from CCT because of good attendance in their weekly fellowship meetings and her regular payment of dues.\r\n\r\nShe wants to further expand her business this Christmas season by applying for a PHP 8,000 loan so that she can use it as additional capital to buy more meat for her barbecue stand. With her extra earnings she hopes that by next year she can start another business aside from her barbecue stand. \r\nHer prayer is that some day, all her children can finish their studies and eventually have a job.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to raise.\n\nWina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 3rd from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

J. is from the village of Cabaruan. She is 40 years old, and is widowed with no children. To make a living, Edna owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Edna has been engaged in her business for many years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Edna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edna is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Edna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the five hundred nuevos soles he is requesting, he will buy feed for his animals, since he knows he must feed them well to improve his sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":451674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T00:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734971,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124298,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960039,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992884,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717671,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T01:02:40Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":163375,"name":"Phin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phin N. lives in Kampong village in the Takeo province.

The milk that she sells is of very high quality because she takes great care with the nutrition of her livestock.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is caring for her animals because she feels great affection for them.

Going forward, she hopes to increase the number of dairy cows that she has because she wants to increase their production.\r\n\r\nThis is Mercedes' first loan with MFP; she knows that she must pay on time and is prepared to do so.

Juliet is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the first loan taken out by Juliet from ASKI.

Although they work hard, they still do not earn enough income to support the family. Thus, Mrs. Lanh S. decided to ask for a loan to buy a cow for breeding.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julie L. is from the city of Capatan Tuguegarao. She is 49 years old. Julie is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Capatan Group\".\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJulie is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Julie owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling ice cream to the local community. Julie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Julie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":449723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Joy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Joy A. is from the village of Brgy. Tuao North, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 23 years old. Mary Joy is the group leader for a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.\n\nMary Joy is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mary Joy owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling pork and chicken barbeque. Mary Joy has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\n\nIn 2008, Mary Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Mary Joy is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products offered. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Mary Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":450781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida T. is from the village of Brgy. Tucal, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 54 years old. Aida is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tucal Center.\r\n\r\nAida is widowed and has five adult children. To make a living, Aida owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing mechanical services to local community members. Aida has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,500 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Aida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is 39 years old. Myrna is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Sta. Cruz Center.\r\n\r\nMyrna is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Myrna raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs to sell. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the first loan taken out by Myrna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

F. is from the village of Cabaruan. She is 45 years old. Rosario is married. To make a living, Rosario owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosario has been engaged in her business for over  years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosario joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosario from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She imports a variety of jewelry items from India, which are very popular among Mongolian consumers. Dashtsermaa started her business in 2008 after conducting a clothing trading business for several years. She had success selling clothes, however, over the years her profits declined due to other clothing businesses opening in her town. Dashtsermaa has grown her jewelry business steadily over the last year and has many plans for the future. She hopes to soon expand her product line by importing Indian fabrics to sell along with her jewelry. She says, \"managing my business succesfully enables me to support my two sons.\" Dashtsermaa is requesting a 3,000,000 tugrug loan to purchase fabrics from India to sell in her
