But Nazca is also known for its hardworking people, who have persevered despite frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and a high level of poverty in the region.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.42,"image":{"id":929138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to fix her house (build a bathroom).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":102.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":106.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":114.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":121.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":131.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":136.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":142.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":148.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":154.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":100.14,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":103.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250735431,"comment":null},{"amount":39.2,"local_amount":102.26,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":106.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142479,"comment":null},{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":106.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":110.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T20:37:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":363170,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eva, de 50 a\u00f1os, esposa de Sime\u00f3n, juntos viven en su casa propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus 03 hijos a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida.

She lives with her nephew and has her own home.\r\n\r\nBetty sews, which she learned by studying at vocational school.  She started her business independently with a sewing machine that she bought with her own money and set up in her house 12 years ago.  At first she did little jobs for her neighbors and friends and with time, her client base grew because of her good work.  What she likes about her job is being able to count on financial income to cover her personal and household expenses, since she is single.  Also, she enjoys what she does and is able to distract herself with this work.  Her future plan is to set up a workshop in her house.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP and she hopes the collaboration will help her reach her goals.  On the other hand, she promises to be prompt with her payments just as she was with previous loans.  In addition to feeling comfortable with the members of her communal bank, she considers them responsible and caring people.  With the loan request of 1000 nuevos soles, she will buy a sewing machine worth 600 soles and fabric and thread for sewing. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":174.79,"image":{"id":929165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"buy a sewing machine, fabric, and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":184.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":146.2,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836197,"comment":null},{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":153.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":155.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245960,"comment":null},{"amount":62.57,"local_amount":166.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":169.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-28T03:02:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":363178,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

In search of a source of income for the family, she started a business  in 2006 selling nuts and dried fruit with starting capital of 10,000KGS. After leasing space at the market, she put all her energy into developing the business and achieved success.  She became one of the leading suppliers and vendors of dried fruit at the market.  At present Etibarkhan doesn't have a wide enough assortment of items, so she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 110,000KGS.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Tavau needs a loan of 1,500 Somoa Tala (WST) to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 WST or US $188 per week) to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nTavau joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tavau's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Maksudakhon works at a local school and is known as a principled and demanding teacher.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a teacher's salary is not high, so Maksudakhon decided in parallel with her main work to do a trade business. Using a sum of 20,000 Kyrgyz Som (KGS) as starting capital, Maksudakhon made every effort to develop the activities -- she harvest and purchases apples from the local population for resale. For these purposes, a specially sealed barn was built, where fruits are stored at a certain temperature and a car was purchased for transportation to the local market.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

is a married mother of five children. She is 57 years old.\n\nPalolo is starting a business venture selling fried foods in the local community. Palolo needs a loan of 1000 Somoa Tala (WST) to purchase new items to expand her product offering. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300WST or US$125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nPalolo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Palolo's first loan with SPBD. \n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tuaoi's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Manoa's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nUfiata joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Ufiata's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Anita needs a loan of WST 2,000 to invest in expanding the business by purchasing fabric, threads, needles, and an elei printing board (decorative printing method used to embellish fabric).  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Anita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Anita's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Sefilina's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is a married mother. She is 40 years old and has two children.\r\n\r\nTusigaigoa owns and operates a business venture, selling both food and daily-use products in the local community.  She has many years of experience in this business. Tusigaigoa needs a loan of Samoan Talas (WST) 1,000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 WST or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nTusigaigoa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Tusigaigoa's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400WST or US$167 per week) to financially support members of her immediate family.\n\nPisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Pisa fifth loan with SPBD. \n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is married, 28 years old, and has two children.\n\nSeine works in her plantation business, planting and harvesting bananas for sale. She has three years of experience in this business. Seine needs a loan of 2,000 Somoa Tala(WST) to  purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be WST$300 or US$125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Seine joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Seine's 3rd loan with SPBD. \n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

is a married mother. She is 56 years old and has 7 children.\r\n\r\nSusana owns and operates a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  She has 5 years of experience in this business. Susana needs a loan of Samoan Talas (WST) 2,700 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 WST or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSusana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Susana's 6th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

He will also buy fodder for his cows and calves.     \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.82,"image":{"id":929401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 8 sheep and 1 pig for his farm and fodder for his cows and calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Sevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T01:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Levik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27740},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":30580},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30080},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30520},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30540},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31430},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30680},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32730},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":32830},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":32600},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34140},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":33980},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34500},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35900},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35580},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":35860},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37140},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":37450},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":37610},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":38560},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":39130},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":39570},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":40300},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40580},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":41580},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":42240},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":42690},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43460}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.82,"local_amount":27740,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":27960.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404894,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T23:06:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":363283,"name":"Mwenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwenda is a married woman with six children, two of whom attend school.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be $300WST or US$125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nTalaileva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Talaileva's 5th loan with SPBD.\n\n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\". For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

five children.  In search of a financial source for his family, he started his own business of breeding livestock and reselling agricultural crops 22 years ago.  Kutmanaly used an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow and was able to grow his business since then to include four cows and sheep today.  Thanks to the monthly profit of about 20,000 som (KGS), he covers his family's daily expenses and saves money for his youngest son's education.  In order to further develop his business, Kutmanaly requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.  In the near future, Kutmanaly's family plans to increase livestock headcount.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":929416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kosh-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-28T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kutmanaly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T18:15:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":363315,"name":"Fevie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fevie is 23 years old and married with two children.

married and has three children.  He works as a master - decorator.  Due to instability in salary and in search of an additional source of income for his family, Misiraly started to get actively involved in animal husbandry.

Her husband works as a taxi driver.  Since 2008, Sapiyakhan has been involved in fattening up and reselling livestock and agriculture.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed her family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Dorcas was only able to harvest three bags of maize on half an acre of land. \r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Dorcas and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit, and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Dorcas will educate her children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing.

maize.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":929701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Garnik is married and has three children: a son and two daughters.  The son is married and lives with his family separately from the parents.  The oldest daughter is not married, lives with the parents and teaches at a school.  The youngest daughter attends a secondary school.  Since 2008, Garnik has been involved in a private entrepreneurship and selling vegetables and fruits.  Garnik himself built the store space, where he runs his business.  Thanks to his business, he bought a small truck, which he uses to travel to Yerevan once per week to get products for his business.  Garnik's wife helps him with the business, and, thanks to this, they work without days off.  Garnik needs a loan in the sum of 900,000 Armenian dram to finish the interior decoration of his store space and to install windows and doors there.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150.09,"image":{"id":929799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to finish the interior decoration of his store space and to install windows and doors there","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-11-29T03:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Garnik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":24356.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33125.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33582.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":32849.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":32969.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":34588.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34384.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34910.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35759.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36288.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36545.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":37365.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37189},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":38693.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":39453.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39438.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40041.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40801},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41023.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":42225.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":42550.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43135.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43947.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":44773.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":24356.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":24377.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263708,"comment":null},{"amount":86.49,"local_amount":33125.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33154.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T17:46:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":363601,"name":"Odette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Odette is 45 years old and a widow.
