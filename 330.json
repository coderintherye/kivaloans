She lives in a rented room with her husband Jos\u00e9, who is 43 years old, and her three daughters: Jeaneth (19), Mariela (16), and Karen (7).  She hopes to improve the quality of life of her daughters.  For Candelaria, or \"Candy\" as they call her affectionately, work is not an activity that causes problems, since she is a woman of a thousand careers.  Some of her principal activities are washing cloths, cleaning homes, selling toys on the street, etc.  Now she finds herself offering food service to missionaries from a church near her house.  She prepares breakfast, lunch, and dinner for them, since she feels that they are her responsibility.  What she likes most about her work is to do things very well, and she is very detailed in this aspect.  She has done these activities for seven years and she finds it is most difficult to distribute her time between each job that does.  For the future, Candelaria hopes to be able to open a restaurant with which she hopes to increase her income.  This is her sixth loan with MFP.  She was very punctual with payments of her previous loans, and she hopes to do the same now too.  In her community bank, she is a well-respected member because of the responsibility that she demonstrates.

With his wife Maria, he has two grown children, who are working professionals and independent.  His business is about 8 years old.  He was able to start working for himself with the help of savings he accumulated from jobs he held previously.  That is, his business is the result of earnings derived from his work as a traveling salesman.  Today Eladio and Maria run the business, and through their efforts it has experienced regular growth and stands up to the competition.  \r\n\r\nEladio has his own home.  He would like to purchase in larger quantities, to benefit from discounts and thus enjoy a larger profit margin from his sales.  He states that the only way to grow is through credit, because it would be hard from him to accumulate operating capital.  This is why he is requesting a loan.  He is a responsible person, eager to achieve, and he has a cheerful outlook.  He is enterprising, and there is no doubt but that he will reach any goals he sets for himself.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":456148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of pasta products, Yerba mate, rice, sugar, flour, and other commodities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-12-23T22:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118079460,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915537,"comment":null},{"amount":81.81,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951147,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679870,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714267,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151897826,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638112,"comment":null},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852174,"comment":null},{"amount":81.81,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":365727.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172118969,"comment":null},{"amount":163.64,"local_amount":727272.76,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":731454.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177412972,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He lives in a house made out of cane, in an area with few basic services. It is located in the Paradise Zone of Guayaquil. His wife is a seamstress and she sells rice and vegetables. They have three children. Two of the children live with him. One is three years old and the other is one year old.

Valida wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls so she can fatten them and sell them at the best price in the local market. Her husband actively helps her with operations.

began his family-car fiberglass manufacturing business with a 500 square foot warehouse, some tools, a few molds, some clients, and many hopes of achieving success! A few years after he began, he was able to buy more tools and molds, hire an employee, and eventually move to a 1,000 square foot warehouse. Today he is progressing even further by creating a new line of products for fishing boats. Eudocio says that thanks to lots of experience in the business and the success they have had in the last few years they have become a notable name in the car fiberglass business. The challenge lies in creating new products and expanding outside of Florida.\r\n\r\nEudocio will use his loan to increase his inventory so that more is available on hand. This helps him to meet the needs of his customers who many times have immediate demands. In the past, Eudocio hasn't relied on credit but he realized how this loan will be helpful for increasing stock that he couldn't afford to buy otherwise - the demand is there and he would like to meet it. He hopes to attend events this next year that will further market his business.\r\n\r\nEudocio's business goals are to become a public company with a well known product - one that is regarded for high quality. He sees his business prospering and, with this success, his daughter will know that with personal strength and family unity you can achieve any goal you desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":456029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

S. is 52 and married with 9 children (ages 18 - 36).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Salote has many years of experience in this business.  Salote needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 tala or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Salote joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Salote's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Salote S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 36 and married with 4 children (ages 16 - 24).  She works in her business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faaga has many years of experience in this business.  Faaga needs a loan of WST $2750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faaga joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lemauai has 1 year of experience in this business.  Lemauai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lemauai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lemauai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lemauai S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Va  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Va  joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Va 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Va F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.78 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Faasagaone has many years of experience in this business.  Faasagaone needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nFaasagaone joined SPBD.This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faasagaone's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasagaone P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 32 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Ana has many years of experience in this business.  Ana needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nAna joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ana P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 25 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, running bingo games.  Evelini has many years of experience in this business.  Evelini needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase game prizes.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 tala or US $271 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nEvelini joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Evelini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Evelini S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Con Libertad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This communal bank is called \"Crecer con Libertad\" (Grow with Freedom) and has 18 members, all hardworking men and women of various ages.  They work in different trades; for example, some make and sell artisanal goods made of wire, stones, and cloth, among other materials.  Other borrowers make handicrafts or work in repairing broken household items, dressmaking, and weaving.  Some borrowers work in sales, selling food, clothing, and maintaining their grocery shops.\n \nThis group's objective is to grow in their respective businesses and reach their goals, while promoting their quality products.  Above all, they want to grow their businesses to create more economic stability for their families, continuing to develop and grow better with each day.\n\nJocelyn is the secretary of the group (in the photo, she is the pregnant woman on the far right).  She is an artisan who makes necklaces, rings, hoop earrings, and bracelets using several different materials.  She works with beads, stones, wood, and cloth, among others.  Jocelyn often travels to Santiago, Chile\u2019s capital city, to purchase these materials.  She sells the products from her home, in markets, and in other well-populated areas.  She will use this loan to purchase more materials for her artisan work in order to expand the diversity of her products.\n\nThe experience that they have had with Fondo Esperanza, according to Jocelyn, has surpassed the group's expectations.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Folole has 6 years of experience in this business.  Folole needs a loan of WST $2350 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 tala or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Folole joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Folole's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Folole T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 30 and married with 3 children (ages 10 - 14).  She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Lesina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Lesina needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lesina joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lesina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lesina L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

is 34 and married with 3 children (ages 8 months - 4 years).  Sou owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Sou needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sou's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score for Sou V.*:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting selling dry woods.  Faasisili has 4 years of experience in this business.  Faasisili needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy timbers, cements and iron roofs.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nFaasisili joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasisili's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasisili T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, driving a taxi.  Matauaina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Matauaina needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy car parts for her vehicle.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matauaina joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Matauaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matauaina T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Falemoa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Falemoa needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 tala or US $125 per week) to expand the business.  Falemoa is a hard working women who wish to improve her business\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Falemoa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Falemoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Falemoa S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

is 58 and married with 6 children (ages 17-25).  She owns & operates a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Mele needs a loan of WST $2450 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nMele joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Mele's 4th loan with SPBD. \n\nThe following social metric is provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:               1.5 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns & operates a business venture, selling food stuffs and other goods.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Lili needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lili joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lili's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score for Lili T.:*               1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n *SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 36 and married with 5 children (ages 6 - 17).  She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Faasaveve has many years of experience in this business.  Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 68 and married with 8 children (ages 29 - 40).  She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Lagi has 7 years of experience in this business.  Lagi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 tala or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lagi joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lagi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagi P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 54 and married with 6 children (ages 17 - 38).  She owns a business venture, selling pork products in the local community.  Nia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Nia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nia joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He's not married, so he lives with his elderly parents and his brother, and helps them with household expenses. William is in his final semester of the Science Education program at URACCAN University. He's also the student body president. William is known as a happy, friendly, responsible, highly motivated student. This is his fourth loan, and he'll use it to create a room for himself in his parents' home, where he can have more privacy. William is grateful to AFODENIC because his previous loans have allowed him to afford home appliances and improve his family's living conditions. Next year he plans to begin graduate studies, and he hopes that by earning a good living, he'll be able to take care of his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva

T. is 54 and married with 5 children (ages 15 - 38).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Sapi has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sapi needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sapi joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sapi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She works as a cook in a private school and in her spare time sells clothing.  She has worked for the school for 21 years and in clothing sales for 3 years.  She began the latter in order to earn extra income because her mother fell ill and she needed to buy medicines.  It has been a difficult struggle for her.  She was a single mother to her two children, now adults.  Now that her mother has passed away, it is very sad for her.  With her previous loan she built a wall for better security.  She will use this one to buy building materials like:  stone, sand, cement, iron, zinc metal sheeting, to start a project: she wants to finish building a bedroom, complete the roof, which is missing a section, and put up the interior dividing walls.  For her business, she wants to increase stock so that her earnings will also increase thereby meeting her required sales quota to meet daily expenses.  She is very happy that the financing has allowed her to make improvements on her home.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

T. is 19 and single with 1 child.  She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Marie has 3 years of experience in this business.  Marie needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marie joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Marie's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Marie T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 39 and married with 5 children (ages 4 - 16).  She owns a business venture, cultivating fruit trees & harvesting its fruit for sale.  Meleane has 4 years of experience in this business.  Meleane needs a loan of WST $2750 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nMeleane joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Meleane's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meleane S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 45 and married with 7 children (ages 3 - 28).  She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Ivapene has 5 years of experience in this business.  Ivapene needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase used sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ivapene joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ivapene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ivapene L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Katerinauataliatalosaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Katerinauataliatalosaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Katerinauataliatalosaga L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 60 and divorced with 2 children (ages 29 and 37).  She owns a business venture, providing general clothing services to local community members.  Faasasalu has 5 years of experience in this business.  Faasasalu needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Faasasalu joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faasasalu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasasalu L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 29 and married with 1 child (3-months-old).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Noma has 1 year of experience in this business.  Noma needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Noma joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Noma's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Noma M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Uila needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nUila joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Uila's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nFalefia, a loan manager at SPBD, asked Uila a couple of questions about her business.  Here are her answers:\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score of Uila V. provided by SPBD:*               1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Christina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Christina needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Christina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Christina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Christina T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score.

She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Fagaitaua has 2 years of experience in this business.  Fagaitaua needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nFagaitaua joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fagaitaua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fagaitaua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 56 and widowed with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Dellilah has 3 years of experience in this business.  Dellilah needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dellilah joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Dellilah's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Dellilah M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

P. is 42 and married with 3 children.  She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Menime has 5 years of experience in this business.  Menime needs a loan of WST $2450 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMenime joined SPBD, and this is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Menime's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Menime P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Vaialalua  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nVaialalua  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vaialalua 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaialalua  U. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Doeun H. lives in Krang Roung village in Takeo province. He is a farmer who owns a plot of land on which he cultivates rice. He faces some problems because he does not have enough money to buy rice seed, and his field is far from any irrigation system.

Aveina needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nAveina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

is 50 and married with 5 children (ages 8-20).  She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Sitoe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sitoe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sitoe's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score for Sitoe A. provided by SPBD:*               1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3 \r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Armelinda P., 44, is a resident of Minsubong, Tangub City.

Her husband earns an average net income of just 2,700 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month (about $58 US) from labor and because of this they have experienced hardships in raising their children.  \r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Armelinda decided to engage in charcoal buying and selling. For 6 years, she was able to sustain it even in times of crisis. Currently she is earning an average net income of not less than 3,600 PHP (about $78 US) a month, which is very helpful in supporting the family. \r\n\r\nShe joined PAGLAUM MPC just this year because she is very much interested in our products and services and for our being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao: we were named Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006. \r\n\r\nAs this is her second loan, Armelinda was allowed to request a loan of 8,000 PHP to add her capital for her business. She will use the future income from this business for her family's daily needs and to save for her children's

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lives of many people turn out in such a way that they do not get an opportunity to go to college. The circumstances force these people to go to work as soon as they graduate from high school. The life makes these people grow up earlier and start supporting their families, whereas their peers may still enjoy their youth. However, there is an advantage to this state of affairs. Beginning to support one\u2019s family from early age makes this person mature and better prepared for life. From this point they could regard themselves even as fortunate ones. T. K. Albina, the leader of this group, is one of these fortunate youngsters, who started earning their livelihood at an early age. Albina is nineteen years old. She is single and lives with her family. She has a sister, who is two years younger than her. Albina combines two jobs. During her spare time she helps her mother, who is occupied with manufacturing traditional articles of bedding and coverlets. Her mother used to work in a sewing workshop, but because of the low salary, she decided to start her own business. Albina has applied for this loan to help her mother purchase fabric and expand their business.\r\n\r\nAlbina\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nAinur, 45, is single. She lives with her father. Because of her father\u2019s illness Ainur is temporarily not working, as she has to stay by her father\u2019s side and take care of him. Her brother provides them with food and medicine. Ainur needs this loan to buy a washing machine, a DVD player and a ton of coal. \r\n\r\nSvetlana, 47, is a mother of four children. Her husband works as a bus driver. Svetlana is a teacher in an elementary school. One of Svetlana\u2019s daughters goes to college and Svetlana needs a loan to pay for tuition. \r\n\r\nAlisa, 55, lives in a city of Balykchi. Alisa trades in sea\u2013buckthorn. Her husband, 65, is retired. Her youngest son, 21, works as a waiter in a caf\u00e9. At weekends he helps Alisa sell the sea\u2013buckthorn. Alisa has applied for this loan to purchase ten sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives in the neighborhood Km 10 Acaray of C.D.E.  She contacted her neighbors and friends in her community to form the group.\r\n\r\nThe group is called San Ignacio.  They are in their sixth cycle, and there are 17 members.  In the neighborhood the group stands out for being very united, supportive, and responsible.  Each one received their loan, and they invested it independently in their own business.  They are all sacrificing mothers who fight to provide all of their families\u2019 necessities.\r\n\r\nEsabel E. sells clothes, and her husband is a bricklayer.  They have four children.  They both start work at a very early hour in the morning.  Isabel travels to different areas to go door to door to sell her products.  She says that the work is arduous, but she needs to do it for her family.  Sometimes the income she gets really helps.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to the Foundation for the help they have given me.  With the loan I was able to get new articles of clothing and more new customers.\r\n\r\n1\r\nDelia L.\r\nSells Plastics\r\n2\r\nSonia Esp\u00ednola\r\nSells Clothes\r\n3\r\nMiguelina V\u00e1zquez\r\nSells Fruit\r\n4\r\nSilvina D.

She is a very responsible and happy person. She lives alone in her own house and what she wants most is to improver her quality of life. In a small room, Leticia has created her craft studio. Everyday, she starts work very early to fulfill requests. Her work is very sought after by her clients, since the crafts she makes are of very good quality. Currently, she is working for a taxi business, making decorations for their anniversary. What she likes most about her work is that she can create her crafts in the peace and quiet of her home. She has been doing this work for 20 years and she considers that the most difficult part is to make the small details in finishing touches. With time, she hopes to open a large store in the center of the city, since currently, she only works through requests. This is her sixth loan with MFP. She is committed to make all the payments on time, since she does not want to cause problems for the members of her communal bank, where she is well liked for the happiness she shows. With the 800 nuevos soles (PEN) requested, she will buy more materials in order to make new decorations, so that her business continues to grow. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":456812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy materials for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T16:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734997,"comment":null},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124363,"comment":null},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960104,"comment":null},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992948,"comment":null},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":143.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717734,"comment":null},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T17:16:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165196,"name":"Vencedoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco D.

He lives with his parents in the Olmos district, about an hour and 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor a year and half Jos\u00e9 has been earning his living by repairing motorcycles and motorcycle taxis in a mechanic's shop he installed in the outside portion of his home. He comments that he had always wanted to know more about motorcycle repair and that he learned the business by watching friends who worked as mechanics. Previously, he earned his living as a temporary worker, which did not provide a stable income. As a result of that experience he is motivated to put everything he has into the growth of his business.\r\n\r\nDemand for his services continues to grow, since motorcycles and motorcycle taxis are plentiful in the area where Jos\u00e9 lives. He finds himself requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternative for the first time: a loan of 500 nuevos soles (the currency of Peru) for the purchase of spare parts with which he will expand his inventory.

Mar\u00eda has a stand in the most important market of her city, from which she sells products from the Andes. Seven mornings a week she sells potatoes, quinoa, goose and other natural products to her devoted clients.

She has been earning her living through this work for 15 years and considers the most difficult part of the work having to deal with dirt that covers the potatoes when they arrive to her stand, since she always winds up very dirty, and that disgusts her.

The oldest son is learning to sew in his spare time, helping with the business.\r\n<p>\r\nCarlos began 20 years ago working in a business where he learned the trade of making suitcases. This helped him to become independent and start his own business two years ago. He works from early morning until he finishes all his orders. He makes backpacks, purses, and suitcases. One of his greatest problems is that the house is small and made of cane and he fears that thieves will steal his sewing machine.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Carlos will buy cloth, fasteners, and canvas to enlarge his business.

Mr. S. is employed at the childcare center of the Seydina Issa Laye Program for Child and Family Development (PDEF) in Cambrene. He is married and the father of two children, which is why he is involved in a secondary business selling perfumes. He is therefore borrowing 150,000 franks [about 350 USD] in order to purchase perfumes. This loan will help him diversify his selection of products and  build up his merchandise stock. An increase in his revenue will allow him to ensure that his basic monthly expenses are covered and also to help some of his close family members who have financial difficulties. \n\nMr. S. is the beneficiary of a collaborative project between U-IMCEC and PDEF, the Seydina Issa Laye Program for Child and Family Development. The goal of PDEF is to reduce poverty in the community and especially to protect the children of impoverished families. Thanks to this cooperation, the parents of these children can obtain loans at more flexible conditions than ordinarily. Since the program was launched in December 2008, 120 parents have received financing, ranging in size from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.\n\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":456835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"building up merchandise stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-13T21:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boubacar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":26684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168502,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007455,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036521,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759079,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-18T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790593,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971032,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708299,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922370,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188876,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-26T11:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484324,"comment":null},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":13342.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620587,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T18:43:56Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165209,"name":"Florencia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" La Sra.

She lives in the house of a family member and the thing she desires most is to get ahead in life. \r\n<p>\r\nEvery day at a very early hour, Victoria opens her grocery store to serve her neighbors. She is an accomplished sales person; she knows how to treat her customers and always convinces them to buy something extra. Her shop is well-stocked as she always is careful to buy the products that are missing. The thing she likes most about her business is chatting with her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nVictoria has had this business for five years. The thing she finds most difficult is having to stay in the store all day and not be able to go out on the street. In the future, she would like to enlarge her store to be able to sell more products.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Victoria\u2019s sixth loan with MFP.

She lives in her own home with her 3 children: Yulisa, 17, Ana, 4, and Gabriel, 2 years old. She wants to offer each of her children a quality education. Her sales stand is located in an important market in the city where she lives. She sells clothing of very high quality; she brings her products to her city from the city of Lima and also from Bolivia. Her stand is highly frequented by the people who shop in the market, since she offers very good prices. What Julia likes best about her work is talking with the women who run the neighboring stands in the market; their conversations make her long work days more pleasant. She has been doing this work for 21 years. She considers transporting her products to the market the most difficult part of the work ,since the bundles are very heavy, the distances are often long, and the work tires her. In the future she hopes to open a clothing store where she would offer her clients better service. This is Julia's third loan with MFP, the local organization working with her. She looks forward to repaying the loan on time so as not to cause problems for her Community Bank, since she is very respectful of her fellow members. With the 1500 soles (Peruvian currency) she is requesting, Julia will buy pajamas with a Christmas theme, in order to take advantage of the demand the holidays will bring and by doing so, achieve good earnings during this season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":456862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy merchandise for her clothing stand ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T18:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110735000,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124366,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960107,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992951,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717737,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":252,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751413,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T20:37:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165216,"name":"Yolanda Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupo Yolanda est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres trabajadoras quienes desean que el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o sus negocios prosperen y tener salud para seguir trabajando.

She lives in her own home with her 4 children: Carol, 12, Yenifer, 8, Jefer, 4, and Yoselin, 3. They are the motivation behind all of her efforts. With this in mind, she raises cattle with care and dedication. Her day begins at 5 in the morning when she takes her cows out to pasture in the fields in order to keep them well-fed and strong, which is what her business depends on. Marleny takes her cattle to her city's Sunday market, where she is able to sell them quickly and at a good price.\r\nWhat Marleny likes the best about her job is walking among the vast fields, where she takes her cows to graze daily. She has been doing this work for 5 years. The most difficult part is getting the cows to the market to sell.\r\nShe hopes that in time she will be able to increase the number of cows she has and thereby increase her income. This is her second loan through MFP, and she pledges to make her repayments on time. As Marleny is a very responsible and orderly person, she does not want anyone who is a part of her community bank to be penalized. With the 1,200 nuevos soles she is requesting, she plans to buy more fodder for her animals to ensure their good upbringing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":456870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fodder for her cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T23:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110735001,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124367,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960108,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992952,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717738,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":204,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751414,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T23:36:11Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165218,"name":"Roger Enoc","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Roger es cliente en segunda secuencia el es esposo de un cliente antigua.

She is 36 years old, married and the mother of four children. She has been known as a vendor for 15 years. She specializes in selling ice, juices and ice-cream. She has made this choice because she always wanted to be able to support herself and because she always enjoys this activity. She is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs [about 225 USD]. The purpose of this loan is to purchase a refrigerator in place of her broken one, and to return to selling her goods. Her revenues go towards paying everyday expenses and helping her husband. \r\n\r\nMrs. Diagene is the beneficiary of a collaborative project between U-IMCEC and PDEF, the Program for Child Development and the Family (PDEF)Seydina Issa Laye. The goal of PDEF is to reduce poverty in the community and especially to protect children from impoverished families. \r\nThanks to this cooperation, parents of such families can obtain credit at more flexible conditions than ordinarily. Since the program was launched in December 2008, 120 parents have received financing, ranging in size from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Dieumbe  D. est parente  b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, soci\u00e9taire  de la caisse de l\u2019U-IMCEC Camberene depuis mars 2003.Elle est \u00e2g\u00e9e  de 36 ans  mari\u00e9e  et m\u00e8re  de 4 enfants.

When he collects, he sends money as remittances.  That way he is able to help with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer dream has been to finish building her house.  She wants to be able to give her children a more decent house and a post high school education.\r\n\r\nShe asked AFODENIC for a loan to build a concrete wall that divides her land from her neighbor\u2019s.  This way her house will have more security.  She is very grateful to the institution because it has helped her with the projects in her life.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":456907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy cement, rocks, and iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T18:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simona De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":871.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":906.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841542,"comment":null},{"amount":43.26,"local_amount":865.26,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":900.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874465,"comment":null},{"amount":40.93,"local_amount":818.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":852.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604337,"comment":null},{"amount":85.5,"local_amount":1709.98,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639806,"comment":null},{"amount":41.23,"local_amount":824.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":858.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561597,"comment":null},{"amount":41.38,"local_amount":827.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":861.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770528,"comment":null},{"amount":42.48,"local_amount":849.6,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":884.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204424,"comment":null},{"amount":42.11,"local_amount":842.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":876.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330139,"comment":null},{"amount":44.11,"local_amount":882.28,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465334,"comment":null},{"amount":75.44,"local_amount":1508.65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1570.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097545,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T21:43:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165233,"name":"El Atardecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo el atardecer est\u00e1 integrado por tres mujeres emprendedoras que desde su infancia han trabajado arduamente ellas son Ileana Jalinas L.

She's thirty-four years old.

But in order for this to transpire a capital and entrepreneurial skills are required. The most valuable skill is, probably, the ability to take risks. Asiyam didn't wait for any changes or for outside help, but decided to start her own business. She could not afford to sit helplessly; her husband had to leave for Almaty City.

Her daughters are twelve and ten and her son is just three years old. Her daughters go to school and help look after their younger brother when they come home, which is considerable help for Asiyam. Her business is very successful even considering the recent decline in trade. She has been able to buy some livestock for her household and raise her families\u2019 quality of life. Right now her monthly income is about fifteen thousand soms ($350), whereas she had started her business with just five thousand soms ($116).

Nurjamal and her family  lives in Karabalta.  Nurjamal's husband works in construction.   During the winter time, building everywhere stops. However, Nurjamal's husband makes every possible effort to find work during this hard time. Nurjamal and her husband are raising three children. The older son is fourteen, the daughter is twelve and the younger son is three. As soon as the two older children started to school, Nurjamal began to think of  finding an additional source of income. Her parents helped her with this.  Six years ago they bought a cow and Nurjamal has started to work in animal husbandry and to sell milk. Since then she has managed to increase her herd. Her husband, despite working hard, always helps Nurjamal to look after the cattle. Nurjamal has a stable monthly income from the sale of milk at a rate of two thousand four hundred som ($56). She already began to think of diversification. Now she wishes to start raising goats. In order to do this, Nurjamal needs funds that she does not currently have.  Therefore, she has applied for a loan.  Nurjamal is certain that in the future, her work will allow her to buy a house.  \r\n\r\nNurzhamal's group includes the following participants:\r\n\r\nAkylai is forty years old. She is the mother of five children. Akylai's husband works as a shepherd. Akylai also raises cattle. Her older children study in school, and help their mother at home when they come home on weekends.  Akylai hopes to take out a loan to buy coal for the winter.  \r\n\r\nJibek is twenty-eight years old. She is married and has three children. Her husband works as a shepherd. Jibek is a housewife. She also raises cattle and sells milk. Cattle cultivation has been passed down to her in her family.   Jibek has applied for a loan to buy a cow and to sell more milk.\r\n\r\nErkayim is thirty-seven years old. She is divorced. Erkayim has one son. To support herself and her son, Erkayim works in animal husbandry and sells milk. She manages to earn six thousand som a month, and her parents help out with the household.  Erkayim would like a loan to buy sheep to raise.   \r\n\r\nMubarahan is forty-seven years old. She and her husband are raising seven children. Her husband works at school as a security guard. Mubarahan would like to borrow money to buy coal for the winter.\r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This led to reductions in many industrial enterprises, factories, shops and plants, leaving many people without work to this day.  Jibek K., the group leader, well understands this fate.  She is an optimist during the storm and courageous at heart.  Jibek and her girlfriends felt the spirit of their time and decided to trade at the market.  At that point in time, Jibek had only two hundred som ($10) to begin her business.  Besides, Jibek is a widow and had to raise her four children.  They have grown up and she has helped them to get on their feet.  The older son is twenty-nine years old. He  is married and lives separately with his family. One daughter is twenty-eight years old.   She works in Kazakhstan.  Her second daughter is twenty-five.  She is working in Russia.  The youngest son is sixteen.  He lives with Jibek  and helps her in the market. They sell confectionery products and eggs. Within fourteen years, Jibek and her children, by working together, were able to buy a partial house and complete it.   Jibek has also bought a dorm room in Bishkek for one of daughters.  Jibek and her younger son supported themselves with trade and did not require material support from her other children.  Jibek does not wish to burden her children. However, she needs a bit of money to put back into the business.  She hopes that a loan will increase sales.  In the future, Jibek  would like to improve her shop and eventually to buy her second daughter an apartment.  \r\n\r\nJibek's partners include:\r\n\r\nGulmira is forty-five years old. She has one son. Gulmira's husband is a veterinary surgeon. Gulmira works buying and selling eggs.  Gulmira needs this loan to repair her car.  \r\n\r\nGulnara is forty-four years old. She is divorced.  Gulnara has four children. All of her children except the youngest daughter work in Bishkek. Gulnara  works in sales and fattening sheep. Her monthly income is six thousand som.  Gulnara need the loan to buy feed.\r\n\r\nBurma is forty-six years old. She is a widow.  Burma has two children. Her older son works in construction, and the younger one goes to school. Burma works selling eggs. Burma  hopes to get a loan to buy a large number of eggs.  \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She had already taken out 4 loans in the past. She has three children. Her business is selling fabric for children\u2019s clothing and breakfast foods. She has been doing it for more than 20 years. She has chosen this activity in order to increase her income since her husband\u2019s income is insufficient to support the family. She is seeking a credit of 150,000 francs [about 350 USD] in order to build up her merchandise stock: to buy more fabric for children\u2019s clothing and also to buy some shoes to diversify her selection. This will enable her to satisfy increased customer demand in the holiday season. \r\n\r\nMrs. M. is the beneficiary of a collaborative project between U-IMCEC and PDEF, the Program for Child Development and the Family (PDEF) Seydina Issa Laye. The goal of PDEF is to reduce poverty in the community and especially to protect children from impoverished families. \r\nThanks to this cooperation, parents of such families can obtain credit at more flexible conditions than ordinarily.

She is thirty-eight years old and, together with her husband, she is raising four children. Her eldest son, 19, is serving in the army; a daughter, 13, and another son, 6, are going to school; the smallest daughter is just two years old.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is extremely difficult for people of Lira\u2019s age to find a proper job. Moreover, even young people are forced to leave the city in search of better opportunities. In such conditions people choose to engage themselves in either trade or animal husbandry. Lira and her husband have chosen to raise livestock and poultry.\r\n\r\nDue to their savings they were able to buy some land and started farming. Later on, they bought cows. Now, Lira\u2019s husband has taken over most of the duties regarding the cattle and the land while Lira has had to stay at home and take care of her daughter. However, she has found an excellent way to help her husband in supporting the family. While staying at home, Lira has started manufacturing traditional articles and handing them in to the shops to sell. Surprisingly, her articles attracted many customers and Lira started to earn decent money. Now, her monthly income is around $155.\r\n\r\nLira wants to start raising turkeys. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase turkeys to raise.\r\n\r\nThese are Lira\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nDomira, 48, is the mother of two children. Domira sells milk products and her husband raises livestock. Domira needs a loan to purchase coal. \r\n\r\nIstatoj, 53, is a widow and has raised four children. To make a living she is engaged in animal husbandry and selling milk. She has applied for this loan to purchase coal.\r\n\r\nGulnara, 46, has three children. Her husband is a farmer. Gulnara helps her husband in working the land. Besides that, she keeps some cattle and sells milk. Gulnara needs this loan to purchase coal. \r\n\r\nKlara, 52, has one son.

Although she's the owner of a combi (van-like vehicle used in public transportation of passengers) she doesn't shrink back from working as fare collector.  She has placed her combi with a transportation company which provides urban transportation along the streets where she lives.  Her charisma and pleasant disposition has made her one of the company's most recognized fare collectors which, in turn, has caused her to have more passengers than any other vehicle.  What she likes best about her work is that, owning her own combi, she can sometimes actually drive it herself.  She has been in this line of work for 10 years and she considers the most difficult part of it having to stand alongside the door all day in the cold draft that comes in from the street.  For the future, Gladys hopes to save enough money to buy a new combi thereby improving her income.

When their daughter was little, Jyldyz obediently sat at home and looked after the child. After their daughter grew a little older, Jyldyz started to grow and sell strawberries. She thriftily saved her earnings and bought a cow for three hundred and ninety five dollars. Due to these contributions of hers, they have been able to build a home.\r\n\r\nNow, Jyldyz is still a housewife, but she manages to make money selling milk as well. Her monthly income from selling milk only constitutes seventy dollars. She sees great opportunities in animal husbandry and is resolute about continuing to breed and increase her total population of livestock. Therefore, Jyldyz has applied for this loan to buy a calf to raise and coal for the winter season. She is planning to build temporary buildings and sheds for her cattle behind the house.\r\n\r\nJyldyz\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nJoldoshbek, 56, is a stock breeder.

Her husband has a tractor and provides ploughing services for villagers. Elmira needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nSaule, 40, has three children and her eldest daughter goes to college. Her husband trades in meat at a local market. Saule is a housewife and also looks after cattle and sells milk. Selling milk brings her $24 a month.

She plans to keep working hard in the future; with hard work she will be able to increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis is Hermelinda's first loan with MFP and she knows she will have to pay it back on time.

She lives with her husband, Luis, 43, and their 4 children, Florentina, 10, Fredy, 9, Candy, 8 and Erika, 7, in their own house.  Her children are the motivating force in her life.  For several years, Florentina has raised cattle.  This has allowed the family to have a worthy life.  She has been in this line of work since she was 13 years old and she is now one of the most sought-after cattlewomen thanks to the big steers she brings into the city to sell.  What she likes most about her work is raising the cattle because she knows that, the better she cares for them, the better prices her steers will command.  She has been in this line of work for 25 years and she feels that the most difficult aspect of it is transporting the steers to the sales points because this activity is very labor intensive.

They will use the funds in their different lines of work; it will be of great utility to them.  Each has her own commercial activity, such as: the sale of clothing, shoes, jewelry, fruits and vegetables, etc.  They will receive a total of  800.000; some 500.000 and others, 300.000 gs to buy sugar, meat, flour, eggs, pasta, sweets, jeans, t-shirts, shirts, lingerie, cheese, chickens.  They all want to achieve both personal and family progress.  Each member has her own type of work.  Thus, Rogelia sells fruits.  She has 6 children.

The average loan for each member is 569.500 Gs., which goes toward various activities such as: selling food, selling merchandise, selling merchandise for the pantry, (rice, sugar, noodles, dairy, bread, herbs, etc.), selling clothing, selling lingerie, selling home-grown chickens, selling charcoal, selling artisan clothing, etc. \r\n<p>\r\nAll of the women do these activities to collect funds. They help each other mutually to accomplish the common goals of everyone within the group and with the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva

Her sons are already grown and make their own living.  The fact that they grew up with priceless qualities, such as hard work, persistence and strength, is a credit to Jumash.  These qualities are absolutely necessary in our life in order not to rely on anyone else.  Her sons saw Jumash\u2019s hard work and persistence in her business.  She sells women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing at a market.  The competition is strong at the market, and, especially now  given the conditions of the crisis, it is not an easy task even for seasoned retailers to maintain business sustainability.  Jumash showed strength after her divorce.  She started working even more persistently.  Her oldest son works at a brick factory.  Her youngest son decided to help her with the sales.  Jumash bravely requests loans.  She knows well that in business, one cannot advance without taking risks.  Her business turnover is now fifty thousand som.  Jumash started selling a long time ago.  She started with vegetables.  Then successful sales made her think hard about transitioning to other types of merchandise.  She transitioned to clothing.  Her first capital was three thousand som ($70).  Now her monthly income is nine thousand som ($230).  Jumash decided not to lose any time on saving her own money and requested a loan right away, in order to invest it into her goods turnover and save herself time.\r\n<p>\r\nJumash has four partners in the group:\r\n<p>\r\nJanyl is twenty-nine years old.  Her husband is a construction worker.  They have three children.  Janyl sells men\u2019s clothing at a market.  She needs a loan in order to acquire new merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nBaktybubu is forty-nine years old.  She keeps cows and sells milk.  She also sells small merchandise near her house.  Her husband works at \u201cMJS\u201d.  They have three children.  Two of them work, and the youngest goes to school.  Baktybubu needs a loan in order to purchase merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nZamirbek is twenty-nine years old.  He is already a father of three children.  Zamirbek works at a brick factory, and his wife stays at home and takes care of livestock.  Zamirbek needs a loan in order to purchase two rugs for home and some small items.\r\n<p>\r\nNasip is fifty-seven years old.  Her husband no longer works because he is retired.  However, Nasip and her husband got involved in animal husbandry.  Now Nasip needs a loan in order to purchase two cows.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":457055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of winter clothing variety in order to support customer demand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T21:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumash","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janyl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baktybubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zamirbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":59000,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10778},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11266},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11777},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12311},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12868}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":246.62,"local_amount":10778,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10852.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121361,"comment":null},{"amount":257.78,"local_amount":11266,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11343.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123957013,"comment":null},{"amount":269.47,"local_amount":11777,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":11858.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989822,"comment":null},{"amount":281.69,"local_amount":12311,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12395.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715633,"comment":null},{"amount":294.44,"local_amount":12868,"processed_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":12956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748482,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T18:06:23Z","paid_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165284,"name":"Maura Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maura M. se dedica a trabajar arduamente en una organizaci\u00f3n en el municipio de Somotillo en el departamento de Chinandega con la finalidad de obtener los ingresos para llevar el sustento a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n y beneficiar a sus hijos.\nActualmente ella tiene la necesidad de mejorar su vivienda y es por esto que solicita un cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de los materiales de construcci\u00f3n porque sus sue\u00f1os son tener un techo digno donde vivir y donde sus hijos se puedan desarrollar.

M. is a resident of the municipality of Laua-an in the province of Antique. \r\n\r\nAt times, she is a reserved type of person, but most of the time she loves talking to people in her community, especially to her colleagues in ASHI. She feels that, through ASHI, she has found friends and someone to confide in when problems beset her. Through her membership, she realized that many mothers have the same problem as hers: poverty. From them, she gained strength and she is determined to work hard to improve her standard of living. She wants her four children, ages 7 to 19 years old, to finish their studies until college. \r\n\r\nWith the support of her husband, Mercy took the risk of requesting a loan through ASHI to expand her small dressmaking business and to start a duck-raising business. By raising ducks in their backyard, she will put the wide space surrounded their rice field to its best use, and augment the income she earns from her dressmaking business.\r\n\r\nAs a woman, having her own business and source of income is more important than depending on her husband\u2019s

M., age 68, is a loving mother to her two children. Even though her children are now 33 and 25 years old, she still wants to support them financially, because they are day-laborers (not salaried) and their small income is sporadic. Ninfa wishes that, some day, her children\u2019s lives will be stable and they will have their own families. \r\n\r\nWhen Ninfa learned about ASHI, a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, she thought that it would be a good source of capital to start her own business and  to achieve her dreams for herself and children. After she was recognized as a member of ASHI, she requested a loan and started a small \u201csari-sari\" (variety) store. However, when she finished repaying her loan, she changed her business to rice farming. Since it was the season for planting rice, she though it would be best to invest her money there, because the profit is as much larger than the profit from her sari-sari store. Her eldest son is her partner in managing her rice farm. \r\n\r\nHowever, Ninfa wanted to restart her sari-sari store to bring the convenience of a small grocery store to people in her village. Her village is very far from the main town and is almost inaccessible, because it lacks transportation and other public facilities. Ninfa is now requesting a loan to restart her sari-sari store. She hopes that her sari-sari business will succeed.

Morillo, age 50, is an industrious woman and a responsible mother. Her five children range in age from eight to 24 years old. Her husband is a laborer and an alcoholic. The money he gives to Novel from his small income is not enough for a family budget because he spends some of his money on alcohol and friends. \r\n\r\nBecause of the hardship and her husband\u2019s irresponsibility, Novel has been searching for ways to augment her husband's income. Just recently, she learned about ASHI, a KIVA field partner in the Philippines, and joined. Since then, she has felt hopeful that, some day, she will achieve her dream of sending her remaining four younger children to college until they graduate. \r\n\r\nNovel will use her loan to start a hog-raising business. Her profits double as capital after the hogs are sold. She will earn income either by slaughtering the hogs, or by raising the animals for four months, and then selling them alive to people in her village.\r\n\r\nBy having her own business to provide food and other basic needs for her family, Novel hopes that her husband will realize that poverty is not a reason to surrender. Through ASHI\u2019s partnership with Kiva, people around world are willing help to them to change their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":457345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

She will invest the requested 800 nuevos soles in buying more sheep, as the demand is high during the holiday period.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":458019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-26T08:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124382,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960123,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992967,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717753,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":108.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751429,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933878,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672768,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":108.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886630,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-26T10:25:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165353,"name":"Nieves","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nieves, de 19 a\u00f1os, es una joven muy trabajadora y alegre, vive en la casa de sus padres, a quienes desea ayudar con los gastos familiares.\n\nSu tienda de abarrotes es una de las m\u00e1s concurridas de su barrio, el gran carisma que posee y la amabilidad en su trato han hecho que sea la preferida por sus vecinos, quienes no dudan en hacer sus compras desde muy temprano, ya que saben que siempre es la primera en abrirse.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es conversar con sus vecinos sobre las cosas que suceden en su barrio, lleva 2 a\u00f1os en esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su tienda, ya que tiene que atender de corrido si no quiere que sus ventas bajen. \nPara el futuro espera que su negocio crezca y se convierta en el almac\u00e9n principal de su barrio.\n\nEste el segundo pr\u00e9stamo de Nieves con MFP, sabe que si lo paga a tiempo podr\u00e1 acceder a otro con mayor tranquilidad y sin traerle complicaciones a su banco comunal, donde es muy querida por el resto de sus compa\u00f1eras.

He has worked for many years making clothes.  Edwin and his wife and three children want to improve their small workshop where they make clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdwin had health problems, and just a short time ago, he had his appendix operated on.  He spent a few days in bed, and if they had not operated on him, he ran the risk of dying.  Now, his wife and children have taken control of the business until Edwin recuperates and can continue working on what he is passionate about, making articles of clothing.

The rest of their sons are married and have their own families.\r\n\r\nThis cheerful man can be described as \"multi-functional\", as he currently works in various trades and is very dedicated to each. He began in farming, which still occupies a large part of his time today, growing potatoes, barley, and peas, which turn a good profit. His twin sons help him with the farming, but only when they have time, since they are still in school. Fortunato also raises and sells rams and guinea pigs, and produces different types of textiles including carpets, weavings, sweaters, etc. This work also occupies a lot of his time, because he learned to create woven products when he was very young and likes the work.\r\n\r\nSince then, this work has also generated good income and he really enjoys making beautiful weavings that have distinctive colors and textures. In the future he plans to plant greater quantities and move away from where he currently lives to try his luck farming in a different region where he has relatives.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from MFP and Fortunato is sure he will make each payment because he wants to qualify for future loans to continue progress toward his dreams.

P. is a 40-year-old woman with the determination and faith to get out from the ties of poverty. She is a mother to four young children. She lives on Talim Island, Binangonan, in the province of Rizal in the Philippines. She is married to Eliezer, a fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.), a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, and the organization she have grown to love since 1995. ASHI helped her to start a business that helps her husband to pay for their daily expenditures. She and her husband had been in the fishing business for more than ten  years. \r\n\r\nFor her eighth loan, she is requesting Php 28,000.00 to continue her fishing business with the support of her husband. She will purchase assorted supplies for her fishing business, such as fishnet, rope, steel, bamboo, threads, and a fishing boat.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that, some day soon, she will have a larger space to store her fishing materials, a bigger fishing cage, and a stall in the market to sell her fish. She dreams also that she will be able to send her children to school and see them finish their studies. Gloria wants to thank ASHI for all its initiatives for the poor and thank the Kiva lenders who fund this loan. \r\n\r\nLike most families here in the Philippines, they want the best in life and a happy family. Now, she enjoys seeing how her ASHI loan changes their lives and gives them more opportunities to make their dreams come

She started these businesses only when ASHI gave her an opportunity to obtain a loan. These businesses are a big help for her family in enabling them to cover their expenses and to set aside savings for the future. Jessie is requesting a loan of PhP 15,000 as additional capital for her variety store.\r\n\r\nJessie dreams that someday her variety store will become a grocery store. She also dreams of sending her children to school until they finish college and find stable jobs.\r\n\r\nJessie wants to thank ASHI for giving her initial capital for her business and for micro-insurance, training and compulsory savings that ASHI has innovated for its members.

She adores them both, and lives with them in her own house.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, as her children were working and were more independent, Carmen decided to pursue a business that allowed her to set her own hours. She decided on beauty product sales. Every day, after doing her household chores, she devotes the rest of the day to delivering and selling the products she has in stock and those that will arrive later that month. \r\n\r\nCarmen is happy that she has made good friends in her visits, as this work allows her to meet many people. In addition to sales calls, clients also come to her house to order and to try sample products to decide which to buy. \r\n\r\nCarmen wants to continue in this business and develop something more stable, like a bazaar, but she knows she has much work ahead of her and is happy to progress little by little. \r\n\r\nThis is Carmen\u2019s 18th loan with MFP and she has a good history, always punctual in her payments. With this loan, she will buy a large quantity of cosmetic products, as she has many orders for this holiday season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":458750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy beauty products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-27T16:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":205.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":216.79},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":231.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":238.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":249.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":258.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.25,"local_amount":205.11,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":211.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124391,"comment":null},{"amount":77.43,"local_amount":216.79,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":223.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960132,"comment":null},{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":231.36,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":238.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992976,"comment":null},{"amount":85.28,"local_amount":238.78,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":245.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717762,"comment":null},{"amount":89.11,"local_amount":249.53,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":256.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751438,"comment":null},{"amount":92.3,"local_amount":258.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":266.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933884,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T19:03:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":165386,"name":"Elsy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsy tiene 40 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo Basilio, quien viaja constantemente, y con sus 2 hijos: Larry (17) y Sara (8), todos ellos viven en su casa propia.\nDesde hace 7 a\u00f1os ella se dedica a la venta de comestibles en la tienda - bazar que posee en su propio domicilio.

S. is from the village of Tuburan. She is 32 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Rosebel owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosebel has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP on average per month for these activities.  She also engages in selling snacks in the local community.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosebel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosebel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan that she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the village of Tuburan, Pagadian, ZDS. She is 24 years old, is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Michelle owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Michelle has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Michelle joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional animals. Michelle is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock for breeding. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Michelle from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Renelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for LTO registration and franchise renewal of the transportation unit used primarily in the business.

J. is from the village of Tuburan, Pagadian, ZDS. She is 36 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a handicraft business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling wood handicrafts to tourists and local community members. Josephine earns approximately 13,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the fifth loan which she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is from the village of Sta. Isabel. She is 39 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Catherine owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Catherine has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Catherine joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. Catherine is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions and for her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nNormalita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Normalita owns and operates a store selling cosmetics and silver jewelries. Normalita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2009, Normalita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Normalita is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional cosmetics and silver jewelries. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Normalita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristina S. is from the town of Rizaluna, Cordon. She is 43 years-old. Cristina is the leader of a 17-member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rizaluna Group.\r\n<p>\r\nCristina is married and has adult children. Cristina is a tricycle operator. In 2009, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide the service. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":455517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

J. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 46 years-old and is married with four adult children. Francisca owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Francisca is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Francisca joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Francisca from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":454407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 36 years old, is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Mary Jane is just starting this retail business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Mary Jane joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the tenth loan that she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 57 years old. Mary is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Mary E. group.\n\nMary is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Mary owns and operates a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. Mary has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1500 PHP weekly for these activities.\n\nMary joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be the fourth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 43 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Daisy owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Daisy has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP every four months.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Daisy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the tenth loan that Daisy has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Romeo C. is from the village of Centro 1, Angadanan, Isabela. He is 28 years old. Romeo is the group leader of a 13-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRomeo is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Romeo owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling breads, cakes and cookies to the local community. Romeo has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP daily.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Romeo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Romeo is requesting a new loan of 28,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the eighth loan that he has taken out from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":455489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

M. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 36 years old, is married and has three infant-aged children. To make a living, Lorena owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish balls and other dim sums to the local community. Lorena is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Lorena joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 35,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the tenth loan which she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 58 years-old. Cristina is the leader of a 12-member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nCristina is married and has six adult children. Cristina raises livestock and the main source of income comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Cristina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 every three months\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonice A. is from the village of Buenavista, Santiago. She is 51 years-old. Leonice is the leader of a 10-member group loan offered by Kiva partner ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Leonice Group.\r\n<p>\r\nLeonice is married and has five adult children. Leonice owns and operates a business venture running a general store, tailoring and selling viand (prepared foods). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Leonice has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP tailoring and 500 PHP from her store weekly.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Leonice joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonice is requesting a first loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
