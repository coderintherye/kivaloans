N\u00b0 2 is 37 years old, unmarried, and the mother of one child, with whom she lives in the ATTBOUGOU district of S\u00e9gou (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nA representative of the administration, she is a personal assistant of the management in a public agency.  Concurrent with her professional obligations, she has been running a business selling incenses and clothing for fourteen years and enjoys great recognition.  Her countless customers are composed mostly of civil servants.  She receives orders both domestic and foreign.  She is in demand for marriages because her merchandise is highly prized by newlyweds.\r\n\r\nHere is the process of making this exquisite and sensational product:  you need 2 kg of magnonkis\u00e8ni (an exotic plant) seasoned with perfumes and <i>eaux de cologne<\/i> (30 bottles) for a month in order to have a nice scent.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about increasing her sales and about coping with customer demands, Fatoumata turned towards Soro Yiriwaso. She has been associated with this micro-finance institution for 36 months.  After four solidarity loans and an individual loan, all properly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.

The loan that she is requesting now will be used to purchase flour wholesale, so that she can continue producing bread. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":384654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to use in the baking of bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T18:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081311,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997466,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842811,"comment":null},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1205.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734388,"comment":null},{"amount":307.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":904.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-07T21:27:45Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135293,"name":"Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karina tiene 32 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus 2 hijos en una casa arrendada.

Due to the good location of her establishment, her sales remain stable.  Also, in the mornings Katrina works as a teacher at a school in her town.  Therefore, she hires someone to work at the store, but in the afternoons she personally runs the store.  In spite of the difficulties of her limited time in her profession and taking care of her children, she continues with her work because she wants to improve the family\u2019s economic situation.  Her intentions are to set up her store with other non-food products like desk supplies and different decorations, etc. that her neighbors need.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth time she has asked for a loan with MFP.

Con sus clientes, Xenia pacta un acuerdo de pago al cr\u00e9dito y seg\u00fan lo convenido, ella les entrega el producto y posteriormente les cobra. De este modo, aparte de su remuneraci\u00f3n como docente, obtiene las ganancias que necesita para  solventar sus gastos personales y de su familia. Su deseo a futuro es seguir dedic\u00e1ndose a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, pero en un local estable con una decoraci\u00f3n atractiva y en una zona comercial de su ciudad. Esta es la quinta vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP, ella es una de las integrantes que promueve la responsabilidad en su banco comunal y esta vez renueva su compromiso de trabajo y puntualidad en sus pagos. El dinero que viene solicitando ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de  productos de belleza para incrementar sus ventas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":384659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T16:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":602.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997468,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842813,"comment":null},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1205.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734390,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717245,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751022,"comment":null},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":301.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T13:55:25Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135299,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth es una mujer muy trabajadora y amorosa.

She leaves home at nine with the hope of getting the needed income.  To do this, she not only offers quality items of clothing, but she also offers a big smile.  This attitude pleases a lot of people, and her good mood is contagious.  What she likes most about her work is selling children\u2019s clothes.  The little ones are very demanding, and they encourage her to improve the quality of her merchandise.  In the five years she has been working, she considers being on foot all day and walking long blocks to sell is the most difficult part of her business.\r\n\r\nHer future plans are to buy a stable stall where she can sell different articles of clothing, especially for children.  Yisela has worked with 29 loans from Microfinanzas PRISMA.  In all of those years she has shown herself to be a person who makes her payments.  She is well liked within her community bank, where they hold her in high esteem.  She will use the 1,400 PEN that she is asking for to buy the merchandise she needs for the new season that is approaching.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":384667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T18:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":326.1},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":342.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":358.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":372.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.46,"local_amount":326.1,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":342.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081314,"comment":null},{"amount":122.47,"local_amount":342.91,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":360.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997471,"comment":null},{"amount":127.98,"local_amount":358.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":376.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842816,"comment":null},{"amount":133.09,"local_amount":372.64,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":391.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-21T15:32:00Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135303,"name":"Tahir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For 12 years, Tahir A. has dedicated himself to raising cattle to support his humble and reliant family.

She owns a neighborhood store that she opened with the severance pay from her previous job, working in a jewelry store that downsized due to low sales. Starting her own business just seemed like the best idea, since she could care for her baby and not have to pay a third party to do so. Her plan is to improve the infrastructure of her house and increase sales. For this reason, she will invest this loan in the purchase of staple grains, meat, dairy products, candy, and other products that will generate more revenue. She thanks AFODENIC for this opportunity, which provides financing that will be of great assistance in meeting her goals of attracting new customers and retaining her clientele with the items stocked.

tiene 29 a\u00f1os, vive con su pareja y madre de su hijo. Por el momento habitan en la casa de sus suegros. Desde peque\u00f1o se dedica a la siembra de papa de diversas  variedades, pero la papa llamada \u201cde color\u201d es su preferida, pues le resulta m\u00e1s rentable porque logra vender cada saco entre 70 y 80 soles, mientras que las papas \u201cblancas\u201d, aunque tengan buen tama\u00f1o se valorizan a s\u00f3lo 30 soles por saco. Pero la debilidad de la papa de color es que es muy delicada en el proceso de su desarrollo y debido a las heladas (clima muy fr\u00edo) pueden sufrir p\u00e9rdidas. Sin embargo, esta temporada Jilmer  est\u00e1 muy contento, pues la temida helada no afect\u00f3 sus papas, las cuales se desarrollaron de gran tama\u00f1o, para ello alquil\u00f3 burros de carga para transportar sus sacos desde los cerros empinados donde las sembr\u00f3. Una vez reunidas en su casa las lleva al mercado mayorista de la ciudad (al m\u00e1s concurrido), donde demoran algo m\u00e1s de 2 horas en terminar de venderlas y con esas ganancias puede solventar las necesidades de su familia. \nPara Jilmer, este es su d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y debido a que aun no llega la temporada de siembra, no tiene necesidad de una mayor inversi\u00f3n, pero \u00e9l no quiere dejar de ahorrar en su banco comunal, por lo que solicita una peque\u00f1a cantidad de dinero, con el que aprovechar\u00e1 en comprar un burro de carga.","en":"Jilmer is 29 years old and lives with his partner, his son\u2019s mother.  For the time being they live with his in-laws.  Ever since he was little, Jilmer has grown several varieties of potatoes.  The potato called \u201cde color\u201d is his favorite and is profitable because it sells at 70 to 80 soles per sack, while the white potatoes, even though they are big; only sell for 30 a sack.  But the problem with the colored potatoes is that they are very sensitive while growing and can be easily lost when it freezes.\r\n\r\nHowever, this season, Jilmer is very happy because the cold season did not affect his potatoes and they grew big.  He rented pack-donkeys to transport his sacks form the hills forested with pine trees where he grew them.  Once they were home, he brought them to the busiest wholesale market in town where it took just over 2 hours to sell them. He is able to take care of his family\u2019s needs with what he earned.\r\n\r\nThis is Jilmer\u2019s tenth loan with MFP.  Since it is not time to plant yet, he doesn\u2019t need a big loan, but he does not want to stop saving with his communal bank, so he\u2019s asking for a small loan to buy a pack donkey with.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

She has worked in the San Francisco School for 22 years as a primary school teacher.  She has support from her husband; he takes on the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for her seventh loan in order to raise two walls and buy zinc and beams. She wants to make her husband\u2019s small motorcycle shop, which they have on the patio, more comfortable.  It is currently a small room covered with boards and zinc, which is in bad condition.  When it rains, most of the equipment, spare parts, and other pieces he changes get wet.\r\n\r\nMildred\u2019s biggest dream is to continue improving her house to make her family more

He works in admissions and records in the Juigalpa Hospital Asuncion.  He lives in a house with his mother, who is a nurse's assistant.  His mother built her house through an INBUR project, but the house still lacks some security items.  Oscar is requesting his first loan from the desire to help his mother buy protection for the windows and the iron door of the entrance.

She has two girls, one, 9 years old, who is studying in elementary school and the other, 12 years old, in secondary school.  Luisa works in the Tierno Galvan School, where she has taught for 17 years.  Her husband helps to pay the expenses of their home.  She is requesting her seventh loan in order to buy two large doors and mount them at the entrance to her patio.  The doors will make her home more secure; now this entrance is boarded up and is not secure.

There are few competing businesses at this market, and his business has seen steady growth. Ganzorig started his business in 2004 after moving to the province center in an attempt to make a better life for himself. Before, he worked as a herder in the surrounding countryside and sold his livestock to get money to start his business. \r\n\r\nThrough the years, Ganzorig has gained much experience and grown his business. His dream is to one day open an electric home appliances store that sells goods using bank leasing. He also hopes to save money to buy his own apartment and to be able to provide for his daughter's education. Ganzorig is a very optimistic person and is working hard to achieve his dreams. He is requesting a loan of $2,350 to purchase more supplies for his construction materials trade

Sonia Z. runs a buy and sell business selling \u201cabaca\u201d (fiber from abaca palm leaf used for handicraft production), and \u201ccopra\u201d (dried coconut meat used for oil production). Since her early married life with Mario started seventeen years ago, this is the business that has provided income for the family. Because of this business, Sonia has been able to sustain the growing needs of their twin children each year.\r\n\r\nWhen Sonia joined ASHI in 2002, she tried venturing into buying and selling other commodities such as rice and salt. Loans she was able to access then were used as additional capital for growing her business and helping other entrepreneurs in their village have access to marketing their products in other villages and municipalities.\r\n\r\nNow, that harvest season for rice is starting, Sonia is requesting a loan which she will be using to finance her rice buy and sell business as well as her salt buy and sell business.\r\n\r\nWith her husband\u2019s help in managing it, Sonia really wants her business to grow. For the financial capital needed, she has no other resource but to get it through ASHI. Her dreams of buying a lot away from the seashore where they will build a shelter that would secure them from the damage that typhoons bring, and the graduation of her children from college, depend on the success of her business and its profitability. Therefore Sonia is determined to use her loan well in the business and to expand her business further. In her previous loans, she never failed to pay her dues to ASHI on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":384990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To finance a large volume of rice and salt for her buy and sell business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":124,"posted_date":"2009-09-08T16:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":102,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4971.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86968022,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T11:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4142.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96878595,"comment":null},{"amount":187,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":9114.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118005691,"comment":null},{"amount":51,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2485.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123843822,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-08T20:40:11Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T07:59:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135407,"name":"Tatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nTatu is a member of the Maendeleo borrower group in Sakina, Arusha.

This loan will be her third from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay for the tuition of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

xts":{"en":"Twelve years ago, Zeboniso started a business selling clothing. Thanks to talent and hard work, she has built a successful company which supports her four children. Over the last year, IMON International has helped Zeboniso with microfinance loans. Because she is committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Zeboniso has used her previous loans wisely and repaid each with a perfect credit history. Now, she is seeking a new loan of $3,000 to replace her depleted inventory. With more items to sell, she can continue expanding business and supporting her family.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which eruped soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients, and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a baker with 5 years of experience. He dedicates himself to the creation of a wide range of sweets. His business has been growing over the years with a team of people who help make the sweets and distributors who deliver it to the markets, general stores and private homes. Through his business, Ilhom has generated employment for others, even though he has only a small number of employees, he has supported them and helped them. With his profits, Ilhom would like to buy some equipment which would allow him to offer his bakery goods in the various plazas and centers of Dushanbe. Right now the costs of the business and the ingredients are high and the cost of sweets is also higher. The demand has not diminished but it's more difficult for him to buy the necessary ingredients. Ilhom is requesting a loan to purchase necessary ingredients, enabling him to produce more quantity needed to meet his customer\u2019s  requests.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in this line of work for one year, and has applied for this loan to buy additional meat and bags to transport it in.

Alesandra got married to Reynaldo, she raised pigs in their backyard.

She had no source of capital then to sustain her grow the activity to become a business since she had no access to credit. Her husband's irregular income being a laborer is yet insufficient for the family daily exnpenses especially of her five children who range in age from one to 13 years now. \n\nAlesandra wanted ever since her livelihood to become a stable source of income or to say a business that is why, In 2004, she joined ASHI to be able to get a loan for a business capital. After loaning several times in ASHI, she had proven her pledge that as a member, she will try her best to use her loan in her business and that she will be able to repay on time. Now, Alesandra requests for a much bigger amount of loan for financing her livelihood activity that turned into a business for the past years. After four months of raising her pigs, she sells them in the market and she profits as much double of the amount of her capital. With large amount of capital, she can purchase more pigs to raise and sell thus making her profit more every four months.\n\nWith the profits she will be having in her business, Alesandra wanted to send all of her children to school until they graduate from college to be able to bring themselves out of poverty in the future.

She was unable to attend school because, although she enjoyed it, the cultural norm was for girls to rely on their husbands to provide, and therefore school was considered unnecessary. B. lives in remote Kolahu city in rural Lofa County, the breadbasket of Liberia. \r\n\r\nB. has a retail clothing business, selling slippers, blouses, pants, skirts, headware, etc. She buys clothing wholesale from nearby Guinea and sells at a temporary market stall alongside approximately 100 other vendors of various trades. She has run her business for 10 years and is successful because her customers like her personality and work ethic. B. is requesting a loan to increase her inventory of clothing, which sells well in the rainy season. Her dream is to grow her business so that one day she can have the biggest table in the market.

Hawa was unable to attend school because although she enjoyed it the cultural norm was for girls to rely on their husbands to provide, and therefore school was considered unnecessary. She lives in remote Kolahu city in rural Lofa county, the breadbasket of Liberia. \r\n\r\nHawa\u2019s business is in red palm oil, used for baking, which she buys wholesale and sells in a temporary market stall in the central Kolahu market. She has run her business for 3 years and is successful because her customers like her personality and work ethic. She is taking the loan to purchase 2 large tins of palm oil, which she will re-package and sell in smaller bottles. Her dream is to grow her business so she can one day have a bigger table in the main market and ultimately her own permanent shop. With the profits from her business, Hawa dreams of raising her family well in her own house and sending the kids to university.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":385126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase 2 large tins of oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

old and is married with six children age 7 to 30. She also cares for two children who were orphaned in the war. Her younger children are in school. Massia herself was unable to attend school because, although she enjoyed it, the cultural norm was for girls to rely on their husbands to provide, and therefore school was considered unnecessary. Massia lives in the remote city of Kolahu in rural Lofa County, the breadbasket of Liberia.\r\n\r\nMassia\u2019s business is retail dry goods, including oil, rice, salt, etc., which she buys wholesale from nearby Guinea and sells in a temporary market stall on the Kolahu-Foya highway. She has run her business for three years and is successful because of the way she treats her customers.\r\n\r\nMassia is taking the loan to increase her inventory to meet increased demand. Her dream is to grow her business so she can one day have the biggest table in the central market.

She has a rather well-off customer base.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs to renew part of her inventory; for this reason, she\u2019s requesting a WAGES loan to buy small spools of thread of different colors, 15 rolls of poplins, and different fabrics. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":385189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy sewing supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Lom\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Am\u00e9l\u00e9vi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":29823.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":30420.32},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":31028.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":31649.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":32282.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":32927.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33586.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":34258.22},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":34943.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":35642.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":36355.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37082.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.24},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135502,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Cecilia A. sells smoked fish and gari at Elmina near Eselem.

He is 44 years old, married and has 4 children between the ages of 5 and 16.  His children go to school in Boane.  He attended college to become a Portuguese language teacher.  Other than his children, he does not support any other family members.  He grew up with his parents in Moamba and he often went to work with his parents, who worked for a public company in Mozambique.  Jorge works for the Mozambique government, carrying out his functions as a teacher in the Boane school district.  He earns 24.000,00MT each month that allows him to support his family, pay for a helper around the house, and pay for his children\u2019s schooling.  He lives in his own home and his wife does not work, as she suffers from a chronic illness.  Jorge already had a loan with a commercial bank (BIM) to build a retaining wall near his home.  After he was finished, he approached Hluvuku-Adsema for a loan of 20.000,00MT to purchase materials for a adding bricks to the exterior of his home.  He prefers Hluvuku-Adsema because they offer a lower interest rate and a flexible repayment schedule.  He pledges to repay the loan without problems in order to qualify for more loans in the future.  His goal is to purchase a vehicle for personal transport.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

He is 37 years old, married and is the father of 5 children between the ages of 1 and 12.  All of his children except the baby attend school.  He studied until the 5th grade and stopped due to the financial situation of his family.  Aside from his wife and kids, he is not responsible for other family members and he lives in his own home.  He left Inhambane for Maputo with his older brothers to seek out a better life.  He has lived in the Boane district for 8 years.  It was in this area that he learned how to do small jobs as a way of earning money to survive.  He sells new clothes that he purchases in South Africa (pants and swimwear).  For example, he buys a swimsuit for 870MT and resells it for 1,200MT.  He earns about 16,000MT per month with this business.  He has already been a client of TCHUMA (a similar loan institution in Boane).  He heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through friends that told him about the advantages of a low interest rate and a flexible repayment schedule.  This is Ricardo\u2019s first loan [with Hluvuku-Adsema] and it is for 15,000MT to buy more clothing.  He pleges to repay this loan without problems so that he will qualify for more loans in the future.  He would like to eventually purchase a vehicle for transportation and hauling various cargo.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":385229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"purchase clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-11T14:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.67,"local_amount":1921.92,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1988.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056870,"comment":null},{"amount":74.74,"local_amount":1949.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816765,"comment":null},{"amount":80.38,"local_amount":2096.93,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708945,"comment":null},{"amount":273.37,"local_amount":7131.41,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7377.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937979,"comment":null},{"amount":72.84,"local_amount":1900.06,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1965.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937980,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T00:20:07Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135526,"name":"Arfino","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Arfino C. nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Nampula (2.800 km a norte de maputo) tem 35 anos de idade, casado e pai de tr\u00eas filhos compreendidos entre dois e seis anos.

He is 39 and is the father of three children, whose ages range from 4 to 10 years old.  They study in the local public scool.  He studied until seventh grade but inevitably had to stop to fulfill his obligatory military service.  He lives with his wife and children in their own home.  He has sent some money to his mother, who lives in the city of Maputo.  He left Panda (and Inhambane) in 1987 to go to the city of Xai-Xai, where he fulfilled his obligatory military service, and four years later, he was able to leave the service.  He now works for a train company in Mozambique.  In addition to working for this company, Joane and his wife sell basic goods (oil, mayonnaise, sugar, corn flour, beverages, etc.) in their own location.  He learned to run his business from friends 19 years ago.  He sells mostly cooking oil and earns monthly wages of 10,000 Mozambique meticais.  He acquires his product locally.  In his company, he received a monthly salary of 7,500 meticais, which he uses to feed his family and will use to make his payments.  He has never had credits from another bank.  This is Joane's fourth loan, and it is in the amount of 12,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy basic goods to sell.  His previous credits were for 5200, 8000, and 9000 meticais, which were all for the same activity and were paid back without any problems.  He proposes to pay his credit back as soon as possible to be able to receive more loans with the objective of expanding his location.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

This is going to be her first loan, in the amount of $350 to buy cement, sand and rocks. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her house finished, and her family living there comfortably.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":368.89,"image":{"id":385236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy construction supplies (concrete, rock, sand)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-11T18:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.11,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":1389.04,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1405.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056873,"comment":null},{"amount":1.14,"local_amount":30.3,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:06:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816767,"comment":null},{"amount":41.59,"local_amount":1109.13,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708948,"comment":null},{"amount":110.05,"local_amount":2934.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T07:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2969.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937985,"comment":null},{"amount":93.78,"local_amount":2500.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2530.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937986,"comment":null},{"amount":70.24,"local_amount":2036,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.11,"payment_id":128971960,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-12T13:17:51Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":135531,"name":"Jiguiseme.

He is 44, married and the father of six children between the ages 4 and 17. All of them students, except for the two little ones under 6. Jose finished 4th grade but had to drop school when he was drafted to the army. He lost his upper limbs while serving in the military, and he also has vision disabilities. He earns a monthly disability check of 7.800,00MT (about U$284) that he uses to support his family, and makes extra money working different businesses. His wife sells basic commodities to help with household expenses. \r\n\r\nJose never applied for a loan from other banks and this is his 4th loan with Hluvuku-Adsema. He asks for $950 to buy construction supplies and build a small store. The other loans were to buy basic items and food and were in the amount of  $235, $550 and $730. He dreams of seeing his store finished and be able to get more loans to get the merchandise he is going to be selling.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

What she likes about her Village Bank is that all of her companions are punctual with their payments and she would like to keep working with them. The loan will be used to purchase more products to continue increasing her inventory.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":385360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-08T18:50:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":129.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":135.48},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":140.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":145.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.48,"local_amount":123.59,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":124.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081317,"comment":null},{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":125.28,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":126.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997476,"comment":null},{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":129.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":130.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842822,"comment":null},{"amount":144.92,"local_amount":421.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":424.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734401,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

pescado seco \u2013 salado en el mercado Moshoqueque (mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Chiclayo).\n\nCompra su mercader\u00eda todos los d\u00edas en el terminal pesquero del distrito de Santa Rosa, y luego retorna a San Jos\u00e9 a ofrec\u00e9rselo a sus clientes; su esposo, al igual que la mayor\u00eda de hombres de la zona, se dedica eventualmente a la pesca, pero lo recaudado por esta actividad no abastece para solventar los gastos econ\u00f3micos de su familia.\n\nActualmente el precio del pescado es muy caro debido a la temporada de veda y a la baja cantidad que se pesca a diario, adem\u00e1s ella tiene que gastar en movilidad todos los d\u00edas para transportar su mercanc\u00eda, esta situaci\u00f3n le ha llevado a la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a nuestra Instituci\u00f3n un cr\u00e9dito de 1200 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de pescado para su venta o eventual procesamiento.\n\nSu m\u00e1s grande anhelo es hacer crecer gradualmente su negocio empezando por vender su producto dentro del mercado, y posteriormente comprarse un auto para poder movilizar su mercader\u00eda con mayor facilidad, otra de sus metas es ahorrar el dinero suficiente para asegurarle a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n de calidad en el futuro.\n\nYesenia es muy conocida por sus vecinos que la consideran una mujer luchadora, responsable y que siempre trata de sacar adelante a su familia.\n","en":"Yesenia is a 34-year-old married woman who lives with her husband and three of her children in the fishing district of San Jos\u00e9, located 20 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo. <p>\r\nShe has been selling fresh fish on the outskirts of the San Jos\u00e9 Market for 3 years. She also processes fish and sells it as dried and salted fish in the Moshoqueque Market\u2014the city of Chiclayo\u2019s wholesale market. <p>\r\nShe purchases fish every day at the fish market in the Santa Rosa district. She then returns to San Jos\u00e9 to sell it to her customers. Her husband, like most other men in the area, is a fisherman. However, the money that he earns is not enough to cover all the family expenses. <p>\r\nAs it is the closed season and fish quantities are low, the price of fish is currently high. Furthermore, Yesenia needs to spend money on transporting her merchandise. This situation has led her to request a loan from our institute for the very first time. She is requesting a 1,200.00 PEN loan to invest it in purchasing fish to be sold or processed. <p>\r\nHer biggest wish is to expand her business gradually, starting by selling fish inside the market, and subsequently purchasing a vehicle so that she can transport her merchandise with greater ease. Another one of her goals is to save enough money to offer her children a quality education in the future. <p>\r\nYesenia is very well-known by her neighbors, who consider her to be a hard-working and responsible who is always trying to help her family get ahead. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":385477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase fresh fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 -

Among their four children, three of them are already enrolled in the primary school which is located in their village.\r\n\r\nMario is a snack vendor inside and outside their village. He makes rice cakes and sells his products to earn a living and meet the daily needs of his family. He works very hard to give his children their educational needs.\r\n\r\nWith this, Mario wanted to request a loan of PHP 6,000 from Kiva lenders as additional business capital. His food snack vending started last 2007 and he is thankful that the business is doing well. He hopes that, through having the loan, his business will become a success for the betterment of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":385091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

G. is from the village of Biasong, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Joyce is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Joyce owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store, selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Joyce has been in business for over four years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joyce joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joyce has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Joyce is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Joyce from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
