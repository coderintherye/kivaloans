His goal is to establish his business in a house of his own.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":222379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of soft drinks and ingredients for quick meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ybycu\u00ed","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-11-05T22:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2300000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":209090.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-20T20:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318702,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937304,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T09:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860870,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20402151,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094218,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987714,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568928,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959285,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176534,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":209090.91,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:46:27Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602187,"comment":null},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":209090.9,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":209486.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038427,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-08T23:01:25Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T18:28:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73210,"name":"Miryan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She started the business four years ago with the idea of finding work that would bring in an income for her family, as the money that her husband earned was not enough to cover the household\u2019s costs as well as those of her son. So she decided to set up a business in her home managing to attract customers and offer them a variety of products. The purpose of this loan is to provide capital so that she can make purchases in Managua at wholesale prices and thus earn a higher profit on what she sells. In this way she will maintain an active presence in the market.

She works as a motorscooter mechanic and her husband works as a barber.  Currently they have two children who are working as factory workers, so their income is relatively stable at 200,000 VND per day.  She and the group has been participating in the Fund for two cycles, and have done well in repaying their loans.  She very much enjoys this method of borrowing and repayment, since it allows her to repay slowly while saving money to care for her children and make sure they can work steadily.  In this round of funding she registered to borrow 4,704,000 VND to buy equipment to fix and sell motorscooters.  Her group also includes:  Mrs. N. Thi Dang, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business in fixing telephones;  Mrs. Quy Thi Le, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business buy running a breakfast service; Mrs. Ngoc Thanh Thi Dang, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to computer repair equipment; Mrs. Hoa Thi Nguyen, borrowing 4,704,000 VND to do business selling beverages.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

The motorbike will be used as a taxi in the area.  She has already found a driver for her bike that will pay her at the end of each day.   Bikes are one of the most efficient forms of transport in and around Bamenda.  The roads are poor so bikes are able to move quickly and suffer less damage than cars.  She will continue her firewood business for extra income. With the profit from this loan, Florance plans to build her family a house and support her family's medical needs.  She is confident she will be able to repay the loan as she has done in the past.

In addition to selling pagnes, she also occasionally sells cereals. To better satisfy her ever increasing and ever mode demanding clientele, she joined the micro finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago. After four solidarity loans (group loans) that were all repaid without problems, she's now seeking her first individual loan. This loan will be used to buy 20 pieces of Fancy pagnes and 18 pieces of Wax pagnes from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali). She sells her products at the Ch\u00e2teau marketplace, for cash or on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly women and a few men.

The gu\u00e9ni and magnokis\u00e8ni seeds will be mixed with perfumes and eau de cologne for a certain amount of time to provide a nice fragrance to the incense.  As for the the white damask, these will be tinted with different colors using dyes of the trade.\r\n<p>\r\nThey get their supplies in Bamako (capital of Mali) for the damask and in Mopti for the smoked fish.

They live in traditional extended families in the Mancourani I district of the city of Sikasso (third adminstrative region of the Republic of Mali).  This group has chosen to become specialized in making atti\u00e8k\u00e8 (a dough or mash made of cassava) and in selling condiments, potatoes, and charcoal.  Theirs has been a shared apprenticeship with their respective mothers, who are friends from childhood.  \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe Benkadi group has had three solidarity loans, which have all been correctly repaid.  The current loan that the group is requesting will enable the members to buy:  20 sacks of potatoes, 20 sacks of cassava, and 8 sacks of charcoal, and to create a stock of condiments (eggplants, onions, okra, flavorings, 10 boxes of tomato paste).  The principal source of supplies for this group is in the city of Sikasso from peasant producers and wholesale merchants.  The merchandise purchased in this way is sold for cash at the marketplace or door-to-door to customers essentially composed of women.  \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, they each envision realizing an average profit of 35,000 francs CFA per month, which will be used to support their families and to invest the remainder in their respective businesses.  The women of this group have the ambition to become wholesaler sellers one day. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":222760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy cassava, potatoes, charcoal, and condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-07T00:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00eechata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350979,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974075,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889448,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440241,"comment":null},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135609,"comment":null},{"amount":229.15,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":118374.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033410,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-09T23:39:21Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73378,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisca tiene 51 a\u00f1os D. edad, es casada, madre D. 8 hijos, estudi\u00f3 el tercer grado D. primaria y vive en el Jr. La Paz s\/n, distrito D.

She is a very hard working woman. She has a shop repairing mopeds and her husband is a barber. She has 2 children who are also employed, and thus her family's income is quite stable at 12 USD per day. She and her group have gone through 2 loan cycles and have repaid the loans. She likes this loan program because it allows her to repay gradually, and at the same time allowing her to save extra cash to assist her children. For this loan cycle, she wishes to borrow 280 USD to buy spare parts to sell and to use in her repair shop. In her group, there are the following members:\r\n\r\nMs. Dang Thi N., Ms 01030001, loan amount 280 USD to invest in her business of selling and repairing telephones;\r\nMs. Le Thi Quy, Ms 01030003, loan amount 280 USD to invest in her shop selling breakfast food;\r\nMs. Dang Thi Ngoc T., Ms 01030005, loan amount 280 USD to buy supplies for repairing calculators;\r\nMs. N.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of ingredients for a food-sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T09:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970730,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886947,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436207,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130480,"comment":null},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027282,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613305,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010388,"comment":null},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232699,"comment":null},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-22T17:28:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73439,"name":"Dilfuza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dilfuza S. is 27 years old.

Kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a piece of cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Christiner needs a loan of US$125 in order to start a new business venture by opening a stand that would sell Coca Cola and other drinks that are popular even in the most remote villages in Africa.

Kuku means chicken in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. The activity requires little start-up capital and space, and, while the chicken are growing, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \nDue to Costancia's business skills, she has also managed to develop a successful vinyagos-sales venture. A vinyago is a beautiful, hand-crafted statue made from wood by members of the Makonde tribe who come from southeastern Tanzania. Woodcarving is an important part of Makonde life, both in ancestor worship and in their own myth of creation. Their wooden statues are of three main types: traditional masks, motifs of female ancestor worship, as well as more abstract, modern forms.\n\nCostancia works 9-12 hours a day, 6 days a week at her different enterprises with the assistance of one employee.  She currently needs a loan of US$550 in order to expand her businesses. Contancia thanks everyone for their support.\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":223015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Business

M., 38 years old, is from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has two children, 11 and 15 years old.  Since 2004, Rehema has been running a grocery store, where she sells general items, including onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. Rehema's store is popular among the local people, especially at times when they need one or two missing ingredients for cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market.\n\nRehema works 9 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by her husband. She currently needs a loan of TZH 770,000 in order to purchase additional inventory for her store, such as juice and soda. Rehema thanks everyone for supporting her.\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":223022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of inventory in bulk for a grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970734,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886951,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436211,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130484,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027285,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613308,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010391,"comment":null},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232702,"comment":null},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":77777.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664518,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-08T22:00:56Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73451,"name":"Dilshoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dilshoda U. is 28 years old.

She is thankful to everyone for their support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of cooking oil for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T17:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970735,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886952,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436212,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130485,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T21:18:39Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73460,"name":"Saiyora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saiyora U. is married, and her husband works as a laborer.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Renovations to a nursery school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T18:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanaisha  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970737,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886954,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436214,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T20:15:21Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73467,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence A. is 49 years old and married with 7 children.

She began her business to keep herself busy and active when she found herself sad and depressed due to her separation, and also in order to have an independent income. For more than 6 years, she has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s clothing. As a rule she travels to the neighboring town to get new garments at very cheap prices. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful. Mavlyuda hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. Mavlyuda requests 2500 Somoni ($750) for a term of 9 months. She promises to repay the loan promptly, as she has with previous loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":223053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy new clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-11-10T01:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavlyuda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":244.42},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":252.16},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":260.15},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":268.39},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":276.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":285.65},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":294.7},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":304.03},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":313.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75.65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.04},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80.52},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.07},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.21},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":244.42,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":249.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323858,"comment":null},{"amount":75.65,"local_amount":252.16,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":257.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943847,"comment":null},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":260.15,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":265.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220915,"comment":null},{"amount":80.52,"local_amount":268.39,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":273.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409841,"comment":null},{"amount":83.07,"local_amount":276.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":282.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102866,"comment":null},{"amount":85.69,"local_amount":285.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":291.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35997079,"comment":null},{"amount":88.41,"local_amount":294.7,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":300.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44579856,"comment":null},{"amount":91.21,"local_amount":304.03,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":310.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973359,"comment":null},{"amount":94.07,"local_amount":313.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":320.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63193186,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T13:51:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T15:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73477,"name":"Sohpia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sohpia M., 35 years old, is from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has three children, all between the ages of 3 and 14.   \r\nSophia earns income running her own business that sells kanga and vitenge, traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women. Kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a piece of cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\nIn order to make additional income, Sophia has also opened a snack shop, where she sells items such as samosas (ground meat and\/or vegetables wrapped in a thin dough and deep fried) and vitafunwa (slightly sweetened, poofy, deep-fried pancakes made of rice flour). \r\nSophia has been running her vitenge and snack shops since 2000.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of additional stock in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T19:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sohpia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970738,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886955,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436215,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130488,"comment":null},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027287,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613310,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010393,"comment":null},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232704,"comment":null},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T20:36:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73478,"name":"Solomon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"U.

They each hope to earn an average  profit of 25,000 francs CFA  per month which would be used to make the loan payments and assist their husbands in meeting family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":223061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase various small business products such as: wax \"pagne\" (dcorative cloth), fabric (medium quality), firewood, embroidered fabric and locally made soaps.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-07T13:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abi  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:47:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350983,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974081,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889454,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440247,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135615,"comment":null},{"amount":145.85,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75329.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T13:04:20Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73480,"name":"Mrs. Kim Huoy Lach Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kim Houy L. is 26 years old and the mother of two children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of an irrigation machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T21:20:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sponsa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970739,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886956,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436216,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130489,"comment":null},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027288,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613311,"comment":null},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010394,"comment":null},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232705,"comment":null},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T23:05:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73497,"name":"Sy \u2013 Sikasso \u2013 00095 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe Jiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 (compos\u00e9 de 4 femmes toutes mari\u00e9es) avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 42 ans et de 4 enfants vivent dans le village Kafela  situ\u00e9 \u00e0  20km de la ville de Sikasso(troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali) dans des foyers polygames avec leur maris, des co\u00e9pouses, les enfants et autres parents.\nUni par des liens de parent\u00e9, ce groupe fait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l\u2019achat et la vente du charbon de bois et la pr\u00e9paration et vente de la bouillie de mil.

They live in large extended traditional families in Sanoubougou I of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  They know one another through ties of friendship and community.  Their principal work includes buying and transforming the waste oil from refineries into soaps, and it also includes buying and selling Wax pagnes (highly prized cloth in Africa), peanuts, millet, and gum.  Traditional soaps are made with waste cotton oil and potash. \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to satisfy a customer base that continues to grow, this group decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which it is on its second solidarity loan (group loan).  And the group performed well in repaying the preceding loan. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this new loan, the members of the group intend to buy:  2 barrels of cotton waste, 2 sacks of potash, 22 lengths of Wax pagnes, clothing for children, 5 sacks of millet, 1 sack of sugar, and 3 sacks of 'henis' gum.  The city of Bobo Dioulasso (of Burkina Faso) and the cities of Bamako et Sikasso are their principal sources of supplies.   The merchandise is sold at the Sikasso marketplace, out of homes, and door-to-door at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed  general of women. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, they each envision realizing an average profit of 40,000 francs CFA per month that will be use to cover the loan interest and to support their families. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":223099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy different goods (waste cotton oil, Wax pagnes, peanuts, millet, sugar, children's clothing, and gum)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaminatou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata T.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 26-year-old Rahma B. from Dar es Salaam. She is single with 1 dependent, Salma, who is 8 years old and was an orphan. Rahma has been running 2 businesses, a charcoal business and a cloth shop, since March 2008. \r\n<p>\r\nAt her mkaa (charcoal) business, she sells charcoal, which are small, black pieces of dry earth that are used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange charcoal, and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she has established a shop that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all 4 sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n<p>\r\nShe splits her time between both business working 1-4 hours a day, 7 days a week at each business. She is requesting a loan of $250 in order to purchase additional inventory in bulk.

As for the pagnes, they are restocked by custom order from the wholesalers of Bamako (capital of Mali). \r\n<p>\r\nThe sales are made at the marketplace, out of homes, and door-to-door at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed generally of women and youngsters. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":223109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy different goods:  pagnes, rice peanut oil, and potatoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safoura   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":167876.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974087,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83938.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889460,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83938.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440253,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83938.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135621,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83938.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033422,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T16:12:50Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73520,"name":"Abies","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abies E. is a retired civil servant.

S. is 37 years old. She is married and the mother of four kids. Currently, the kids are in school. Amina loves selling goods, the business through which she makes money to support her family. She has been selling onions and beans for ten years to support her family. Onion is one of the popular food spices which add flavor to sauces and soups. Beans are used in the preparation of many local foods like \u2018red-red\u2019, beans sauce and kebab. The sale of these commodities has created job opportunities for many women like Amina. She takes delivery of stock from the local farmers who provide her with direct supply, and retails to her customers.

Mary plans to buy and sell palm oil and farm on land she already owns.  She will divide her loan between purchasing palm oil, paying for the cultivation of her farm land, and spending on transportation.  She plans to contribute 250,000 CFA (approximately $500 USD) of her own savings towards her business plans.\r\n\r\nThis is Mary`s fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  From her past experience, palm oil is in high demand in her area and she is confident that she can sell it quite quickly.  Bringing palm oil and vegetables from her farm to her community will reduce the transportation costs of her clients. These clients will be able to purchase these items nearby.  She is confident that this loan will allow her to provide more products and therefore sell more.\r\n\r\nWith the profits from this loan, Mary hopes to expand her business and farming activities.  She also plans to support her children, improve their education, and increase her family`s living standards. She knows she will not have a problem with her repayments because her loan schedule is designed so that her payments are small and regular.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":223233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

What Isabel appreciates most about her job is how she\u2019s able to dispense her time.  If she wants, she can work all day, or at times if she needs to attend to her children then she\u2019ll work at night. On the other hand, sometimes when she has orders to close production by deadlines it\u2019s somewhat hard to do so in the small shop that she has - it\u2019s quite overwhelming, but she has responded well and the benefits of her work prove to generate the much needed profits.

She repaid the loan in four installments.\r\nWith this loan of 400 soles, which she'll also repay in four installments, Giovanna hopes to buy workbooks, coloring utensils, and notebooks.\r\nGiovanna dreams of owning a big store where she can stock many products.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by N Aviva, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Giovanna Elizabeth tiene 39 a\u00f1os y pertenece al Banco Comunal Santa Elena II, vive en Mz B 39 lote 28 Manuel Ar\u00e9valo II etapa del distrito de La Esperanza provincia de Trujillo, departamento de La Libertad Per\u00fa.\r\nGiovanna es profesora de Educaci\u00f3n Primaria, pero este a\u00f1o no se present\u00f3 a los contratos, porque se sent\u00eda un tanto agotada, se cas\u00f3 de  24 a\u00f1os con Rafael Ortiz, con quien tiene 2 hijos, un var\u00f3n y una hija.\r\nGiovanna atiende una librer\u00eda en su casa, con la vocaci\u00f3n de maestra que la caracteriza, ayuda a los ni\u00f1os que van a comprar a comprender  sus l\u00e1minas  y les sugiere como armar sus trabajos. \r\nCon su primer cr\u00e9dito de 300 soles  que fueron devueltos en 4 cuotas invirti\u00f3 en comprar regalitos, para la librer\u00eda.\r\nCon este cr\u00e9dito de 400 soles que ser\u00e1 cancelado en 4 cuotas, piensa comprar cuadernos, colores y l\u00e1minas.\r\nGiovanna sue\u00f1a con tener un gran  basar, donde pueda colocar diversas cosas en su negocio."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":223348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy wholesale notebooks, coloring utensils and workbooks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Esperanza - Trujillo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovanna Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":464.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417502,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T13:24:57Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:48:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73631,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isabel tiene 35 a\u00f1os, convive con su pareja, con la cual tuvo tres hijos: Yaquelin de 14, K\u00e1terin de 10 y Arnol de 6.

She has worked since she was very young and now has to financially support her family. Consequently, she decided to make a living providing cellular phone services for the past six years. This endeavor earns good profits because she goes to different places in her effort to gain more customers. The biggest complication is to fulfill her motherly duties, such as supporting her children with their homework and chores, because she has to work. She has to leave them alone often and cannot be there for them when they need her. However, it is her job that provides them with school clothing and keeps them healthy, and Isabels feels fortunate to realize this reality. This loan is her first with microfinanzas PRISMA.
