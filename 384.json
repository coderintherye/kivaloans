Ortiz, considerado el distrito m\u00e1s poblado de la regi\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n el que tiene m\u00e1s altos \u00edndices de pobreza, la mayor\u00eda de su poblaci\u00f3n se encuentra agrupada en zonas urbano \u2013 marginales, es aleda\u00f1o a la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la venta de comida en su domicilio, ella ofrece diariamente men\u00fa y cebiche (plato t\u00edpico del pa\u00eds hecho a base de pescado fresco) a los mec\u00e1nicos que trabajan por la zona y a los mototaxistas que frecuentan el lugar. Este negocio le provee de ingresos necesarios para ayudar en el mantenimiento de su hogar, ya que los ingresos que percibe su esposo como trabajador de un peque\u00f1o hotel no bastan para salir adelante.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os Patricia y su esposo adquirieron una mototaxi (veh\u00edculo motorizado utilizado en el transporte de carga y pasajeros) con unos ahorros que hab\u00edan estado reuniendo, con este veh\u00edculo se vienen generando algunos ingresos adicionales, el veh\u00edculo es manejado por un chofer particular y brinda servicios dentro del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz y la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nEl continuo uso brindado a la unidad movil ha hecho que esta empiece a sufrir algunas fallas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para que pueda funcionar correctamente. Por ello Patricia se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de su veh\u00edculo as\u00ed como en la renovaci\u00f3n de las licencias necesarias que permitan brindar su servicio dentro de la legalidad correspondiente.\n\nPatricia es una mujer emprendedora y una madre muy entregada a su familia. Su mayor anhelo es brindarle a su hija una mejor calidad de vida. Ella ya ha trabajado anteriormente con Nuestra Instituci\u00f3n y ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad al momento de asumir sus pagos. En la imagen aparece en su veh\u00edculo junto al chofer encargado de manejarlo.\n\n","en":"Patricia is a 38 year old mother who lives with her husband and daughter in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district.  It is considered the most populated district in the region and it also has one of the highest indices of poverty.  The majority of the population is in urban areas and is marginalized; she lives next to the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>Patricia has sold food in her home for many years, she has a menu and cebiche (typical dish made from fresh fish) sold to mechanics that work in the area and to the mototaxistas who frequent the place.  This business gives her the necessary income to help the household since the income that her husband receives as a worker in a small hotel is not enough to get ahead.\r\n<p>Two years ago, Patricia and her husband got a mototaxi (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers) with some savings that they collected.  They have gotten some extra income from this vehicle.  It is driven by a hired driver and the mototaxi runs in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district and in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>The continual use of the vehicle has meant that it has had some problems and it is important to repair it so that it can work properly.  Patricia is asking for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa (Kiva\u2019s field partner) that she will use to repair and maintain and to renew the necessary licenses to operate the mototaxi legally.\r\n<p>Patricia is a very enterprising woman and a very dedicated mother.  Her biggest with is to give her daughter a better quality of life.  She has worked with our institution before and has shown to be punctual and responsible when making her payments.  In the picture she is shown with her mototaxi and the driver in charge of driving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva

Rivera is 41 years old and lives in the community of Viloma in the province of Sipe Sipe within the city of Cochabamba. It is about 20 kilometers to the city. He works as a farmer, and his wife works in milk production.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in the field since he was very young. He grew up without his parents and was raised by his grandmother, who passed away three years ago. He still misses her because she was like his mother and thanks to her he learned how to be a responsible, hard-working man. He is dedicated to his family; he is married with three small children, who he teaches to be good people. He would never leave his children or his wife. He works as hard as he can so that they do not lack for food. He starts his day in the morning helping his wife milk the cows and after that he cuts alfalfa and works his land. Occasionally he works as a mason too.\r\n \r\nHe needs a the loan to purchase farm machinery which will make his work much easier. He will be able to deliver feed for the cows in much less time and thus have more time to spend with his children and wife because he has to start work very early. He works so that his children can have a better future and he dreams of seeing his children finishing university, working as professionals, and having a better life than he has. His abandonment by his parents still bothers him, but he thanks God for his grandmother because she was the best thing that happened in his life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Her husband works as a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to milk production.  She has cows that she milks, and she makes cheese to sell to her neighbors.  She also occasionally grows beans at home, which helps her to maintain her home and her children.  \r\n\r\nLourdes has three children from her first husband, and he left them many years ago.  During that time she met Issac V\u00e1squez Ledezma.  He helped her a lot from then on; he helped her start the dairy business.  They are now married, and they have one more child.  The conditions in which they live are meager. They have a house with small adobe rooms.  She keeps her cattle on the same property. \r\n\r\nLourdes is very dedicated to her work.  She and her daughter get up very early everyday to milk the cows.  They then take the milk to be able to sell it.  Luckily, they now deliver their milk to the Milk Industrialization Plant unit.  They are paid regularly every 15 days for the milk they have delivered.  The prices are low.\r\n\r\nLourdes is requesting the loan to be able to buy a dairy cow and balanced food so that she is able to produce more milk and increase her income.  The idea that Lourdes has is that her daughter be able to study to be a veterinarian.  Lourdes could never fulfill her dreams of studying a career.  With the growth of her milk production business she could pay for her oldest daughter\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nThe vision that Lourdes has is to see her children grow healthy, strong and responsible.  She wants them to have a better future than she had.  She also wants them to be capable of confronting whatever difficulty confronts them in life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

(0) is a 42-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Bali. Ni Made is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Sari Amertha 1 (MUK-0016).\r\n\r\nNi Made is married and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 200,000 IDR a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Made joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell. The loan will be her first from MUK.\r\n\r\nNi Made plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About MUK:<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b>\r\nNi Made Y. (0) merupakan 42 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali. Ni Made adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah Sari Amertha 1 (MUK-0016).\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual. Ni Made sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 1 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Made menghasilkan sekitar 200,000 IDR. Dalam 2010, Ni Made bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. Ni Made meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":523377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase piglets to raise and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10147545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189218,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T05:13:38Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192613,"name":"Sokha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokha S., age 39 (pictured with her mother-in-law) and her husband, Mr. Savann Va, 37, live in a small village along National Road Number five about twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh.

S. (0) is a 35-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Bali. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Wisma Cempaka 1 (MUK-0018).\r\n\r\nDewa Mas is married and has four school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 1,000,000 IDR a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Dewa Mas joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital. The loan will be her first from MUK.\r\n\r\nDewa Mas plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children\u2019s tuition fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About MUK:<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b>\r\nDewa Mas Ayu M. S. (0) merupakan 35 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali. Dewa Mas adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah Wisma Cempaka 1 (MUK-0018).\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual produk untuk dipakai sehari-hari seperti shampo, sabun, & pasta gigi di tengah masyarakat setempat. Dewa Mas sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 1 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Dewa Mas menghasilkan sekitar 1,000,000 IDR. Dalam 2010, Dewa Mas bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. Dewa Mas meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":523389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dewa Mas Ayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10147545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189219,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T02:06:27Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192615,"name":"An's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of her business' income comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Raquel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month through these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Raquel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raquel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Raquel has now requested a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Raquel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from this loan to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

U. and her family are very much thankful to ASHI. Because of her membership, she has able to access loans she used to finance a business from its start and through its growth. Her husband\u2019s fishing business started very small. Eventually, through their consecutive and increasing amount of loan received through ASHI, it has grown because they were able to purchase two fishing motorboats.\r\n\r\nLolita is the one who sells the fish to the fish vendors in the town\u2019s public market and the proceeds of her business are used to improve the lives of her family and support the education of her three children. Unfortunately, Lolita\u2019s children didn\u2019t want to pursue their education in college. Lolita is unhappy with their decision but she has to respect her children\u2019s decision to help her in growing her business and making it stable and profitable.\r\n\r\nWith that, through the loan she is requesting, she plans to purchase another fishing boat to be managed by her eldest child who is now 24 years old. Lolita and her two daughters (18 and 19 years old) will be helping each other to sell their fish and record the family cash flow.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Lolita wishes her business will become stable and sustainable whereby it generates employment. She wants to help other people in their community have their own source of income through her family

D., age 30, is from the village of Poblacion Sapang Dalaga. He is married and has three small children. To make a living, Arnel is engaged in the retail sector, particularly in the selling of household items. Through this activity, he is able to earn a monthly net income amounting to 5,000.00. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Arnel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. He wanted to help improve his living situation and increase his ability to engage in business activities. Arnel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for his business. Arnel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new stocks for his store. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Arnel from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":523344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She sells good and dry charcoal to customers in order to encourage them to continue patronizing her business. Annie started selling with very little cash, but she has now improved. She has a problem because a lot people sell the same goods that she sells, which sometimes makes business bad. She plans to use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000.00 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more charcoal to serve customers. Her goal is to expand her business to a better size and to improve the living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Annie is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

She has requested 170,000 CFA to purchase one bag of rice, one bag of flour, two tins of oil, and two bags of corn. The rest will be used to purchase sugar, spices and maggi (flavoring cubes for soup, like boullion).

She hopes to use the profits from her business to pay for her children\u2019s school fees, pay salaries to individuals who manage her farm, purchase seeds for her farm, and reinvest in her business. She will use this loan to manage current afflictions in her life, such as the theft of a significant amount of money, and to build a house for her and her children.\r\n\r\nH.\u2019s loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Nain is a mother of five children. She is currently living in Kitchu, Cameroon. M. is currently requesting her third loan from GHAPE. She has been with GHAPE since 2007 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nWith this latest loan, M. is hoping to continue the business practices supported by her prior loans. She has requested 135,000 CFA to purchase one bag of corn and one bag of groundnuts. The rest will be put towards the purchase of farmland, firewood and the processing of the corn. She believes her business will succeed because of her prior success, a consistent presence at her location without fail, and multiple orders from her customers. She hopes to use the profits from her business to purchase a piece of land on which she will build a house for her and her children, pay for her children\u2019s school fees, food for her family to eat, medications for her family and reinvest in her business. Her biggest struggle is to take care of her children and she hopes to leverage her relationship with GHAPE to overcome the burden. \r\n\r\nM.\u2019s loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":523576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Corn,

Christina is a married mother of eight who currently lives in Kikfuini, Cameroon. Christina is requesting her second loan from GHAPE. She has been with GHAPE since 2008 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nWith this latest loan, Christina is hoping to continue the business practices supported by her prior loans. She has requested 110,000 CFA in order to purchase two goats, two piglets, and bags of feed. The rest will be put towards clearing and hoeing of her farm. She believes her business will succeed because of her prior experience. She has been in this business for over ten years. She hopes to use the profits from her business to continue reinvesting in her business, purchase kitchen utensils, pay for her children\u2019s textbooks and meet her GHAPE obligations. Her biggest struggle has been the passing of her two sisters within a year. It is a burden she lives with everyday and will do what is necessary to ensure her children stay healthy and safe.   \r\n\r\nChristina\u2019s loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":523580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Severina recognized that she could easily sell fruit to her customers while they filled up on gasoline and has decided to diversify her business (sound like any gas stations you know?).

Desde entonces ha continuado con esta actividad, que es la agricultura, especialmente la producci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de Pl\u00e1tano y Cacao. Durante la etapa de siembra y cosecha necesita de peones para ayudarla en su labor, abarcando entonces casi toda la semana, de Lunes a S\u00e1bado, desde las 7:00 AM hasta las 6:00 PM, trabajando en sus campos con esmero y dedicaci\u00f3n. Al final los productos que cosecha son vendidos en su comunidad a un precio accesible para el consumidor.

They live together in their own home located in a populous section of Ayacucho.\r\n\r\nIrene has always been of strong character and has always sold everything her parents produced.  Since then, she has continued with farming, especially bananas and cocoa.\r\n\r\nDuring planting and harvest seasons she requires farmhands to help her with chores taking almost the entire week, from Monday through Saturday, from 7am to 6pm, to work the fields with dedication and great care.  At the end, her products are sold in her community at an accessible price for the consumer.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to reach her dream of having her house built with substantial materials so that her family\u2019s quality of life will improve.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she assures that she will continue to repay in a timely fashion.

This help will help the R. family for their future family projects.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":523661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, fungicides, seed and other farming supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113.37,"local_amount":2267.46,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2372.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348416,"comment":null},{"amount":117.8,"local_amount":2356.09,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2465.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766901,"comment":null},{"amount":18.83,"local_amount":376.45,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":393.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201210029,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T20:44:48Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192749,"name":"Ivonne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ivonne T. is 50 years old, lovely and happily married with two children,all girls.The first child is married and the last is still in school.

He lives with the mother of his four children, who are of school age. They live together in their own house, located in the city of Ayacucho. The field has been his since he was 12. Thus every morning he leaves for his farm, and for this he feels happy, doing the work of a farmer, raising cacao.  Jacinto felt that he had to take action; it is for that reason that he is redeeming a patrimony, just as his parents did. Since then, in the planting and harvest seasons he needs workers, but during the school vacations, between January and March, he receives the help of his children. He generally sells his products in the Collection Center of his community, which results in a profitable sale, helping him to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he hopes to extend the land he cultivates, so that he can also raise coffee and citrus fruits. This is his fourth loan from MFP, and he promises to make all the payments. Furthermore, he has no difficulties with the members of his community bank. With the loan he is applying for, he will invest in the maintenance of his farm, so that he can produce greater quantities in less time.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam

Normally he sells his products in the Collection Centers of his community, but he sells his fruit in the city of Ayacucho.

This school was opened in 1955 by the M.C.A. Mission. Currently, the school is staffed with 8 teachers and 395 pupils. This will be the second loan this school is accessing from SMT\/Kiva lenders. The first loan this school accessed from Kiva was in April 2009. That loan made significant improvements in the lives of these borrowers. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other school's staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would not otherwise be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nKabba K. J. (pictured on the left) is the head teacher at the school and leader of this group of teachers. The 59-year-old man was born in Bendugu village, which is about 60 miles away from Magburaka town.  He is married to a teacher and they have seven children.  Kabba, who has been a teacher for 34 years, is requesting a loan of SLL 1,000,000 to buy house-building materials like iron corrugated zinc, nails, boards, etc. in order to complete building a five bedroom-and-parlor house he started building with the help of the first Kiva loan he received.   \r\n\r\n(Attached to this photo are some snapshots of borrowers who were not able to be present for the group photo).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":523169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy house-building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bendugu village, Magburaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-04-14T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kabba K.

The children are students in the local elementary school. \r\n\r\n Mar\u00eda Lourdes, at 56, buys lumber. She cuts it and makes boards, strips, beams, etc. She has been doing this for 10 years and works Monday to Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. She also raises animals such as pigs and chickens, which she sells in the area markets.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the communal bank thanks to a friend who was a member of the little bank. The loans she has obtained have benefitted the economic stability of her home and the growth of her business. With the new credit, she is going to buy more pigs and feed to raise and sell them. Her biggest dream is to be able to have a lumber warehouse.\r\n\r\nBlanca E. has also been a member of this bank for 8 cycles. She was invited by a friend to join the bank. The loans have helped her to start her business. She has sold fast food for 5 years. She rents a locale close to her home and works from Monday to Sunday. Previously she was the only person sellling in the area but now she has competition.  She works from 12 a.m. to 2 p.m. and later she goes out to sell from 4 p.m. until 9 pm.\r\n\r\nBlanca is 51 years old. She was widowed 5 years ago. Her husband died of a hepatic coma. She had four children from her marriage. They are 29, 26,  20 and 18. Her two oldest daughters are married and independent. Her 20 year old son studies at the university and her youngest son works and he helps her out financially in the home. She does not own a home and so they rent. She will invest the new loan in fixing her cart, which is her work equipment. Her dream is to have a minimarket. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

She lives in the Quiroga neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. She is married and has 7 children aged 14 to 33. Ana's biggest satisfaction is serving and providing customers with sanitary and well prepared food made by her and her employee. That is how her restaurant  \u201cRestaurante y comidas r\u00e1pidas Arch\u00edes 70\u201d has no competition in the area. At present, she is using a loan of  $1.800.000 to buy the necessary raw materials and ingredients to prepare this food: grains, dairy, edibles, beef and chicken as well as some tools for cleanliness and sanitation for the locale.  \r\n  \r\nAna started her restaurant in the year 2008 but she has had experience in this activity for 15 years. Her parents and relatives have had this type of business and she has been close to it since then. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a chain of restaurants that stand out with the quality of their processes and to generate more sources of employment. Another dream is to make her daughters into professionals in the areas they really like. The hardest part about deciding to start her business was the expectation of having the necessary economic resources to do it.   Now her biggest challenge is remodelling the restaurant, giving it an air of modernity more attractive to customers.  This way, when they arrive to consume the products, they will feel at ease and always wanting to return. Ana likes the neighborhood where she has lived for 25 years because it treats its people well, she considers it safe, and because it has in its schools, sports clubs  and in its church a real and potential market.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":523646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase grains, dairy, edibles, beef and chicken and some cleaning equipment  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-04-14T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1800000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143580},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136571},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":139416},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142321},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145286},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":148313},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151403},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":154557},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":157777},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":161064},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":164419},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155293}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.27},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.78,"local_amount":143580,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":145943.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677904,"comment":null},{"amount":72.08,"local_amount":136571,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":138818.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712319,"comment":null},{"amount":73.58,"local_amount":139416,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":141710.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636147,"comment":null},{"amount":75.11,"local_amount":142321,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":144663.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550532,"comment":null},{"amount":571.49,"local_amount":1082819,"processed_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1100639.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000788,"comment":null},{"amount":81.96,"local_amount":155293,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":157848.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673861,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T20:53:19Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192808,"name":"Simon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simon has operated his food stall among many other businesses in Naivasha town for the last two years.

He is usually on his land from Monday to Saturday from 7:00 am until 6:00 pm.  His family will occasionally help, but he generally has laborers who help with the harvest of cocoa and citrus fruits.

She lives with her husband, a farmer, and their six children, the eldest five of which are day laborers, while only the youngest goes to school. Elsa sells clothing for men, women, and children, as well as cosmetics and creams for the hair and body. She sells her products door-to-door and must walk many kilometers each morning in order to sell the clothing.

Cempaka 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Made R. S. (0) is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Bali.  Ni Made is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Wisma Cempaka 2 (MUK-0019).\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Made is married and has two adult children.  To make a living, Ni Made owns & operates a general store selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ni Made has been engaged in this business for over one year and earns approximately 200,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Made joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ni Made is requesting her first loan from MUK.  She is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Ni Made from MUK.  Ni Made plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.\u00a0 As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click on the following link: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Made R. S. (0) merupakan 39 tahun wanita.  Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Ni Made adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota.  Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar.  Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah Wisma Cempaka 2 (MUK-0019).\r\n\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual produk makanan & barang kebutuhan sehari-hari di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Ni Made sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 1 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Made menghasilkan sekitar 200,000 IDR.  Dalam 2010, Ni Made bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Ni Made meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK.    Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir.

L., 48, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. Married to Constaniano L., a vendor, they are blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been buying flour and rice sacks, which she cleans and sells back for a profit.\r\n\r\nExpedita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrowed to expand and improve her buy and sell business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more quantities of sacks, so that she can maximize her income.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s health.

the two years she has been a member of ASHI, 67-year-old Catalina S. has been faced with a lot of challenges in her family and business matters. Her grandson lives with her, and her husband got sick and has been hospitalized. His medication expense has consumed almost the entire amount of Catalina\u2019s business capital that was meant to maintain her small \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store. Because of that, inventories at Catalina\u2019s store were not replenished and eventually it became empty. After that incident, Catalina and her family went back to zero. They restarted with hopes that they will be able to have another business again. \r\n\r\nAlthough life was hard for Catalina and her family, their aspirations of overcoming poverty strengthens their bond to each other and they work hard together as hired laborers just to have money to support their needs, especially those of their grandchildren. Now, she is requesting another loan through ASHI because she wants to restart her \u201csari-sari\u201d store and also to start a new business of hog-fattening.  Both businesses will be based at their home and in their backyard. Therefore, aside from managing her businesses together with her husband, she can also take care of her grandson and the rest of the household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":523990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To

To be able to make this a business and have their own source of income, Joy joined ASHI and requested a loan. At first their business went well. However, because of all their expenses for food, clothing, and other basic needs, Joy has not able to re-invest their income in the business. It was just small enough to cover all of the expenses of her family and business. With that, Joy was not able to sustain her business. Her husband sells \u201cpandesal\u201d (a Filipino favorite bread in the afternoon) every day to have an income to support their needs.\r\n\r\nNow that summertime has come to the Philippines, Joy wants to restart her ice cream making business. Therefore, she is requesting a much larger loan through ASHI to purchase the needed ingredients. Her husband will be the one to sell the ice cream to people around their town and in the villages. With this business and with the support of the loans she can access, Joy and her family hope that someday her business will be stable and profitable, providing them a better kind of

She has now requested this loan for Kes. 30,000 to expand her stock of poultry. She says that this loan has helped her diversify her farming and enabled her to have multiple sources of new income. She is also in a better position to meet her family's basic needs. In the future, Jane would like to expand her agrovet business to other town centers within the area because she feels there is an untapped market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":524071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand her stock of poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-04-15T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136702720,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144736682,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151920553,"comment":null},{"amount":13.11,"local_amount":983,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159660910,"comment":null},{"amount":25.56,"local_amount":1917,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1972.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166875197,"comment":null},{"amount":26,"local_amount":1950,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142168,"comment":null},{"amount":42,"local_amount":3150,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3241.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177436995,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2572.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576396,"comment":null},{"amount":152.22,"local_amount":11416.74,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11747.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191449968,"comment":null},{"amount":7.78,"local_amount":583.26,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":600.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202029883,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T17:10:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-21T08:08:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":192981,"name":"Nelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelma Y. is from the village of Poblacion, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, the other wife of her husband and their children in Koko, one of the best-known districts of the town of Koutiala (Sikiasso region). For social reasons, Mrs. Sali did not have an opportunity to get an education, which explains her early interest in helping her mother in commerce. After trying several business activities without success, eleven years ago she finally turned to the purchase and resale of various articles such as fabrics. Sali\u2019s business is very popular with customers because of the quality of her goods. In order to expand her activity and satisfy customer demand, a year ago Sali has decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After two joint (group) loans, she is now seeking her first individual loan. She plans to purchase a supply of fabrics in Cotonou. She sells in the town of Koutiala to a customer base composed of both women and men, for cash or in credit. She hopes to achieve a monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which she will use to repay her loan, contribute to the everyday family expenses and reinvest the rest into her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

B. was born in the district of Zavala, Inhambane Province, in southern Mozambique. She is 48 years old and married, with 10 children between the ages of 12 and 25. Only the five youngest go to school. She finished fourth grade but had to stop when her father passed away. She lives in her own house with her family, and is not financially responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe moved from Inhambane to Namaacha when her husband was transferred, and they set up a new home where they still live today. She's had her own business for more than 20 years. She doesn't have employees, and relies on her husband for assistance. She sells cornmeal, tomatoes, and onions, and brings in about 5000 meticals, which she reinvests in her business. She is not able to save anything and depends on her husband's pension.\r\n\r\nShe's never had loans with other institutions. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client. This is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. She is requesting 15,000 meticals to buy essentials and increase the amount of stock she can carry.\r\n\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that she'll be eligible for others in the future. Her dream is to have her own shop, and will request additional loans to prepare a space in her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Five years later he was discharged and went to the district of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland, saying he was going to visit his aunt, and ended up settling down and still lives there today. Today he's owned his own business selling aluminum pots and pans for more than 10 years. He has a flexible schedule because he sells by special order in Swaziland, and has made two trips to coincide with pension payments.\r\n\r\nThis is Carlos's fifth loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.
