She is a widow and mother of a 15 year old girl who is in school. She lives in government housing and takes care of her parents who live in Boane by sending them 500 meticais every month. \r\n\r\nFrancilia started working for the Red Cross as a janitor. Due to her dedication she earned a scholarship to take a class at Social Action. She was first assigned to Nampula Province, in North Mozambique where she met her deceased husband. After her husband's passing, she requested a transfer and was assigned to the Namaacha District as a technician at the District's Women's Health Services and Social Action where she has been for more than 10 years. She earns 3,324 meticais per month and has also been rendering services to the City in the same District as a member of the City's Assembly for more than a year, earning a monthly salary of 5,314 meticais under a 5 year contract. She spends her earnings with household expenses and manages to save some in her savings account. \r\n\r\nShe never had loans with other banks. This is her third loan with Hluvuku and second with Kiva. With this loan, in the amount of 25,000, she plans to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, iron and others) to continue her construction. The previous loans were for 5,000 and 20,000 meticais and were used for commerce and housing (to legalize her lot of land). \r\n\r\nShe is confident she will pay ahead of time and request even more to finish her house and leave the government housing she currently lives in.

Nabi is 55 years old.  He is married and has two children.  He is the sole breadwinner for his family, and his only income comes from raising and selling sheep and large livestock at the local market.  Every year, he buys young heifers and sheep from farms in adjacent villages.  He raises them with the help of his sons and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n\r\nNabi is thinking about expanding his business because the income from his present herd is not sufficient to provide for his family.  He plans to purchase more young cattle.  To do so, he needs to invest an additional 6500 somoni in his business.  In order to obtain this amount, he has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan has a rich history.  It hosted a key post on the Silk Road and marked the extent of Alexander the Great's empire.  It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi.  The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Five of the children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nEsther has requested this loan of 40,000 Kenyan shillings through Juhudi Kilimo to expand her poultry project. She hopes that the extra income from this project will help her improve the well-being of her family. Her biggest challenge has been poultry diseases.

Kiva borrower is a 33-year-old married man living with his parents. He is from Lebanon. He has driven a taxi since 2005. His main route is between his village and its surroundings. He works hard to cover the increasing costs of food, housing, and other family expenses. \r\n\r\nToday, he is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to replace the van engine.

Lina plans to invest the loan in the purchase of a rice cooker as well as other new kitchen tools she needs to continue cooking problem-free, which she hopes will help her increase her earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":619143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Buying a rice cooker and other kitchen supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-18T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":118.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":131.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":141.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":105.54,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":110.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588735,"comment":null},{"amount":43.19,"local_amount":115.17,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":120.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725233,"comment":null},{"amount":44.35,"local_amount":118.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":123.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463330,"comment":null},{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":122.56,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":127.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886727,"comment":null},{"amount":48.34,"local_amount":128.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":134.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327080,"comment":null},{"amount":49.19,"local_amount":131.18,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":136.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195618,"comment":null},{"amount":54.72,"local_amount":145.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":152.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269373,"comment":null},{"amount":49.67,"local_amount":132.46,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":138.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549453,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-18T16:54:47Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":239145,"name":"Carla Lilian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carla es cliente antigua la actividad a la que se dedica es la comercializaci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir, espec\u00edficamente la de compra y venta de pantalones poleras y chamarras las mismas que las adquiere de la ciudad de Santa Cruz y las distribuye en varias zonas de la ciudad de la Paz, entrega su mercader\u00eda a cr\u00e9dito.

He and his wife, Mar\u00eda, want the best for their daughter who is studying at the university. They need to pay tuition so that she will have a better future.

She is married and has 6 children between 12 and 31 years old.  Five of the children go to school, and the eldest is employed.  Joana only finished seventh grade and did not continue school because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house and supports her grandchildren, who live with her.\r\n\r\nAfter her wedding, more than 25 years ago, she began farming as a means of supporting her family.  Joana owns 25 hectares of land.  She has no employees and counts on help from her children and stepchildren.  She has planted corn, butter beans, cowpeas, peanuts, watermelon and pumpkins for sale, as well as some for her family to eat and some to use as payment when she requests labor for the harvest.  She sells mostly corn in cans and sacks (120 meticais for 31 cans and 360 meticais for 50 sacks), earning an income of around 21,600 meticais for each period.  She uses this money for household expenses, and owing to her husband's illness (he is currently hospitalized), she does not have enough money because of the hospital expenses.  Joana approached Hluvuku and Kiva to request a loan to keep up with her work.\r\n\r\nThis is Joana's second loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.

She buys millet at the Konodimini market. In order to bake cakes, she hulls millet, grinds it in a grinder to make flour, which is then mixed in with millet broth and a bit of yeast so as to make dough. The resulting dough is then cut into pieces and fried in peanut  or palm oil. Mrs.  Magnin\u00e8 Traor\u00e9 hopes to achieve an average monthly income of 21,500 West African Francs, which will be used for savings and for some everyday household needs.

For 4 years she has been selling pigs and sheep. First she buys animals from farms and then tries to keep them in good condition until they reach exactly the right weight to be sold at the weekend livestock markets in her community. This is how she makes her weekly income. However, during the other days of the week, she works looking after children in her home, as her neighbors sometimes ask her to do this for them. On the other hand, her mother helps her with selling the animals and this work is quite profitable, especially during the holiday season. For this reason, Ang\u00e9lica wants to keep selling animals and to have more working capital. This is her 16th loan from MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support and is very responsible about her repayments. She also likes being part of the community bank because all the members are people that she knows, who are responsible and very supportive. She is very grateful to the people who will be managing the loan, which will be very useful in advancing her business.

They got the idea for the business after adopting their dog Chopper in 2006 and quickly realizing that there was nowhere in town to buy the pet accessories they wanted. Rick, who had spent 18 years as a store manager for a big company, knew he had the experience necessary to open their own store to fill that gap. \u201cHaving my own business is something I\u2019ve always wanted, and I had been thinking about for years,\u201d said Rick. \r\n \r\n Rick and Alaycia have adjusted their store to the needs of the town, as well as the economy. A couple years ago they shifted their focus from pet accessories and expanded the store to include a grooming salon. The Pampered Pet Boutique has since won their city\u2019s \u201cBest of the Best\u201d award two years in a row, and the couple intends to defend their title as long as they can. \u201cWe\u2019re offering a service and want to make sure that pets are going home in the best condition possible. Regardless of how the economy is doing, people treat their pets like family,\u201d says Rick. \r\n \r\nThe Pampered Pet Boutique has over 2,000 clients, so the dryers, clippers, and tubs are always busy. Rick and Alaycia used their own money to start the business and now need capital to maintain their equipment and continue operating. But despite their success, their bank turned them away due to tight lending standards in the credit crunch. \r\n \r\nRick discovered Opportunity Fund through the City of Tracy, which was trying to help its small business owners. With a $5,000 loan they will be able to upgrade old equipment and continue to build up their credit. \u201cI had no idea that there were non-profit groups out there lending to small businesses, so I\u2019m really appreciative of this chance,\u201d Rick said.\r\n \r\nTo find out more about the The Pampered Pet Boutique, visit:

Her business is located outside her house, where every day Maria takes from her kitchen tables, chairs and all of the utensils she needs to start her work.  Since she has been in this line of work for 5 years, she now has a lot of experience, and as a result she has a lot of customers who prefer her pupusas because she has gained the confidence of her customers.  Maria requests a loan to buy a large quantity of corn, beans, pork rinds and cheese, the raw materials to make pupusas.  She also wants to stock her business with hot and cold drinks.  She wants to do this so that people will not only buy her products to take to their houses, but also will eat at her establishment.  With the increased sales that this would bring Maria would benefit, because this would help her family's finances, which are in great need of improvement.

However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. \r\n\r\nHe will be using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy food items for making meals for his customers.

M.

He sells second-hand tires. He has been in this business for the last 15 years. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge is that there are other people in the area doing the same kind of business. He also lacks enough finances to grow his business.

A. is 36 years old. She is married and has two children, aged 10 and 12 years old respectively, whom they hope to give a good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHer business is located at the Bamburi Mwandoni estate in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and it is well known for its many many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian ocean's white beaches. \r\n\r\nShe makes clothes for adults and children. She provides tailoring services to the local people. She has been doing this business for the last five years now and has managed to provide employment to one person. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that people are keen to have clothes made only during the festive seasons, therefore, during other times, business is low with low returns. \r\n\r\nHowever, she works very hard to keep her business doing well.

He hopes to construct a permanent house for his family in the future.\r\n\r\nWith the Kshs 30,000 he wants to start another business of selling fish and purchase a sack of dried fish for resale. Mohamed decided to join Yehu because of easy accessibility to sustainable financial services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":374.45,"image":{"id":618998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To

In her home, which is centrally located, Donata found a great opportunity. She installed a food store where she sells gas for balls, rice, and various essential items.
