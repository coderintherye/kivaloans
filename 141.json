This community is located in the southeast of the Department, in the central Andes region of Peru.  Its altituD. is between 2571 and 4550 meters above sea level.  The climate has a temperature of about 10 to 15 degrees C (50 - 60 degrees F).  It is one of the provinces that are potentially productive in agriculture, livestock, and mining, with a variety of ecological levels that result in a high capacity for competitive production.  At the same time it has archeological and ecological riches.\r\n\r\nRosana H. is married with 4 children.  She used to wash clothing in order to maintain her family.  She had problems with her husband because he drank too many alcoholic drinks and he was jealous.  Bit by bit Rosana built a small capital that was enough to begin selling food.  With the loans that she gets, she invests in her business, and now she doesn\u2019t only sell food, but rather she also has a small snack store that generates a better income.  The loan that she is asking for will be used to buy soda pop and to improve her business and continue growing it.  Her dream is to distribute snacks and to have a restaurant.\r\n\r\nGenovena P. is married and has 2 children.  She didn\u2019t use to have a business; she was solely dedicated to the home and her children.  Only her husband had an income.  He works in a mine and has one week per month to visit them.  With what he gives her, she saved capital and bought merchandise.  Now with the loans that she has gotten she rents a stall in the market and her business is growing.  When her husband comes, she closes the business and when he leaves she opens it again in order to continue selling.  Her dream is to save to buy land and to have somewhere to live, as at the moment she lives in a rented house belonging to her family.\r\n\r\nSonia A. is married and has 4 children.  When he husband retired from his previous job (mining) he got some money that they invested in a business selling chicken and vegetables, sales that they do by walking around with goods on a cart.  The problem that Sonia has is that her husband left her to go with another person, and after this he stopped coming back to the house.\r\n\r\nSonia moved on, working for her children and getting her own income.  Now she has a stall in a market rather than a cart, and now she also sells groceries.  Her dream is that her children could become professionals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":215116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"The members of the Community Bank Las Rosas and Guindas need different amounts of loans to a total of 8800 soles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T07:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeny Ivonne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Paulo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T18:12:42Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8800,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":1466.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932511,"comment":null},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":1466.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214806,"comment":null},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":1466.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396536,"comment":null},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":1466.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088308,"comment":null},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":1466.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981837,"comment":null},{"amount":483.35,"local_amount":1466.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442633,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T17:12:42Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70209,"name":"Zoila Albina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Zoila tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad,  habita en el barrio Anexo Villa Venezuela, tiene dos hijos de 15 y 18 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y tiene que luchar diariamente para poder salir adelante con su familia.

She and her husband are working hard to get ahead, and in the future she wants to refurbish her business premises to give her shop a good reputation, so it is competitive and stands out in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":215127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of pigs, steers and chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.066667 -76.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-25T07:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-08T11:01:10Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951459,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224486,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417209,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110807,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006201,"comment":null},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":177.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590136,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-25T10:01:10Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70215,"name":"Nelvith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Nelvith pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Margaritas\u201d y vive en la Regi\u00f3n San Mart\u00edn, Provincia El Dorado, distrito D.

A. is a member of the community bank, Legendarias D. Chanquil. Chanquil is an area with extreme poverty, about 3300 meters above sea level, which can be found off the main road from the province of Cangallo. The area is dedicated to agriculture and commercial stores. Nelida is not married and has a one year old son. When Nelida was sixteen years old, both her parents died, leaving her and her siblings as orphans. Since then, she has been working to maintain her parents' cattle farm. She will invest her loan of 500 soles into purchasing young cows and bulls that she will eventually be able to sell. Unfortunately, Chanquil is in the rainy season which makes it difficult for Nelida to go to the local fairs and sell her stock. In the future, she hopes that she can save enough money so that her siblings and her son will not have to suffer like she did and instead, attend the University to become professionals.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdith C. V. is also a member of the Legendarias D. Chanquil community bank. Edith's husband left her a year ago and she has been supporting herself and her two children, aged 12 and 10 years. For the past three years, she has been selling cachipas (a type of cheese commonly sold in the area) at the local fairs; with this income, she is able to pay for her home. In addition, Edith also has a small stand in the local elementary school where she sells sodas, sweets and crackers to the students. She will invest her loan of 500 soles into purchasing materials to make cachipas, and for her stand, she will purchase sodas, cookies, candies and gum. Opening a small store in the area is a goal of Edith's. Additionally, she'd like to see her children attend University to become professionals. She is saving her earnings to educate her children. \r\n<p>\r\nVilma A. C. is married with 5 children; the eldest is 20 and the youngest is 10, and they are all in school. Vilma and her family also live in the small community of Chanquil in the region of Ayacucho, Peru. As a member of the community bank, Legendarias D.

She cultivates their land. Almost all of her life, she has had to work on the land. It is the only form of work that she knows. The farms are in areas that are at a very high altitude, where she has to wait for the rainy season, but now she plans to rent farms that are irrigated. What she like most about this work is to have very cultivated farms, without any weeds, so that she will have good yields. She has sown 2 sacks of beans and 20 sacks of potato seeds. Sometimes, cultivating her land does not supply her with enough. As a result, she also has to graze sheep. The prices of fertilizer have increased a lot, and when she can\u2019t buy it, she has to sell the mutton. Maria also works so that she can educate her young children, who are studying. The money that she is requesting is to spray her fields, so that she can harvest her crops and bring them to the market. She hopes the prices in the market will stay the same until the day that she harvests, so that can sow more, even though she has to rent land. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":215203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To spray her fields for cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T12:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T15:23:22Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957443,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227693,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422928,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116152,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011112,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594716,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989242,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T14:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70260,"name":"Jorge Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge es socio del Banco Comunal El Roble, es soltero, tiene su negocio de mototaxi, empez\u00f3 hace 1 a\u00f1o y medio trabajando en compra y venta de autoradios, parlantes. \r\n<p>\r\nJorge desde que recibe los pr\u00e9stamos ha formado un capital.

In the morning, she is at home, but at 10:00 she has to graze her bulls, which serve to plow the land, or to help her husband on the farm. She comes from a farming family. Because of this, she has always worked on agriculture. What she likes most is to raise animals, like cows and bulls, because they are very useful for sowing and when she sells her products, they carry a considerable amount of weight. It is difficult that the price of fertilizer has increased. In earlier years, it didn\u2019t cost very much and she could sow without difficulty. Now, it costs 215 soles per sack, while it was 85 soles before; it is large difference. Because of this, sometimes she doesn\u2019t want to sow, but if she doesn\u2019t sow, she won\u2019t have the means to live. The goal of her effort is to continue acquiring tools for her home and later, to have her own house. The money that she is requesting will be invested in sowing of potatoes and peas, and if she is able to, she will also sow barley on her parents\u2019 farm. If she harvests from January and February, the price will be very good.

His goal, with time, is to plant larger quantities and educate his children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for his potato crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T03:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T04:47:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957445,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227695,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422930,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116154,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011114,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594718,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989244,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210577,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T03:47:32Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70263,"name":"Rosa Candelaria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  se\u00f1ora  Rosa Candelaria T.

She and her husband work on the farm. She has always liked working, and she is not dependent on her husband. Because of this, in addition to working on the farm, she has decided to buy trees, chop them, and sell them as firewood. In this way, she will have another source of income. She is thinking about opening a grocery store, since she now has her own house, because she likes to be around people and, at the same time, will earn more money.

At present, she is living with her grandchildren, who accompany her. Earlier, she worked in agriculture. She had banana farms, but their price in the market is very low and is not suitable for her. Because of this, 5 months ago she decided to open a restaurant, where she now has her own house. Every day she prepares food for her guests. What she likes about this business is that she is around people and, in this way, she doesn\u2019t feel alone. The most difficult thing has been waking up very early to begin preparing the food. The most inconvenient thing, sometimes, is having leftover food, which she then has to sell at an even lower price for the pigs. In her eagerness, she has put this restaurant before the failure of the farm. Malvina is an expert is gastronomy. Her regular customers include teachers, nurses, and some tourists. With this loan, she will invest in necessary merchandise for her restaurant, such as rice, sugar, noodles, and oil, which are fundamental so that she can prepare the day\u2019s menu and take care of her clients. She says that the business is going well for her. With time, she wants to have a country restaurant, to decorate it with leaves, which she hopes will attract tourists, and above all to prepare traditional food on holidays. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":215209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients and supplies food the preparation of her food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T16:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T17:12:33Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":139.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957447,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":139.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227697,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":139.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422932,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":139.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116156,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":139.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011116,"comment":null},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":139.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594720,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T16:12:33Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70266,"name":"Maria Jamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en un barrio de la capital de Managua en los Laureles Norte, es madre soltera y tiene una hija de 20 a\u00f1os de edad, que esta casada.

Santos studied until the second year of elementary school, which equates to third grade, because her mother was poor, she did not have a father and had to work since she was very young.  She married, but 7 years ago was widowed.  She has 5 children, 4 work and only 1 depends on her now because he is still a student.  She began her business by selling food.  She later sold gas and now also sells beer.  She is thankful for the Manuel Ramos movement because thanks to it she could obtain loans easily.  Santos operates her business out of her house, and now counts on a partner.  Her first loan was 300 soles and she returned itin 4 months.  With this loan she expanded her business and purchased gas which she later sold.  With the current loan of 1,000 soles, which she will repay in 6 months, she plans on investing in beer.  Santos dreams of watching her youngest son become a professional, as her other children could not become professionals for economic reasons.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":215298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase beer to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Salaverry - Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T23:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-10T02:51:11Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951501,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224528,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417250,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110835,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006221,"comment":null},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":177.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590156,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-27T01:51:11Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70315,"name":"Silvia Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1orita Silvia P.

His entire life has been devoted to cultivating his fields. He plants coffee, bananas and also during this season he plants caigua (a vine which grows a small gourd-shaped fruit, used as a vegetable). He grew up with farming activities because his father was a farmer, and he knows how and when to grow each product. He likes taking care of the plants because the process for each is different. He is concerned about the price of guano (manure from sea birds) and other fertilizers because he invests a lot and earns very little. But his dreams are based on farming. In time he would like to have a house made of solid material, not of wood as he now has. He and his wife are trying to buy their own house so they have something to leave as an inheritance to their children as well as giving them a good education, something which neither were able to have. With a loan he will fertilize his caigua fields so they blossom and bear fruit. He will also plant more pacay (a Peruvian leguminous tree, cultivated for its large white edible pods) in his orchard.

She works at the business 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her children. Husna currently earns about $100 USD per month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $450 USD to buy more charcoal. In the future, she plans to increase the stock and also to open new business. Husna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Lucy has been running a home food item shop since 2006, selling commodities such as maize flour, beans, rice, and tomatoes.  Assisted by her sister, she works  12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and currently earns about $60 per month from her business. <p>\r\n\r\nLucy is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy food items in bulk for her shop. In the future, she plans to have her own hotel. Lucy thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This is 34-year-old Anna M. K. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children, between the ages of 4 and 15. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant whose parents cannot afford to send her to school. Anna has been running a banana shop since 2000. Her business is selling bananas in batches. She works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and currently earns about 120 USD from her business per month. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to buy at wholesale price from farmers and to re-sell to business people from Dar es salaam. In the future, she plans to sell by going to Dar es salaam herself. Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":216057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy bananas at wholesale price from farmers to resell to business people from Dar es salaam.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T09:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T13:15:50Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970694,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886911,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436171,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130444,"comment":null},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027246,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613279,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010362,"comment":null},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232673,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664489,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T12:15:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70518,"name":"Suos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Suos H. lives in Thorm Chey Village in the Takeo Province.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":216062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy salon items such as hair costmetics, nail polish, artificial hair, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T18:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T22:58:21Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970695,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886912,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436172,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130445,"comment":null},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027247,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613280,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010363,"comment":null},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232674,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664490,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":40803.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105235,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T21:58:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70523,"name":"Mwashamba's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwashamba has been selling dresses at her small shop in Zanzibar for 3 years.

In fact, she has been selling desserts since 2000, and she can earn approximately US$5 per day. Lun is married to Mr. Morn Ran, 68, who is also a farmer. More specifically, aside from her dessert-selling business, Lun takes time to grow rice with her husband because it is the main source of income for their family. <p>\r\n\r\nDuring the farming season, Lun employed people from her village to transplant rice, but she was unable to pay them as of yet due to a lack of money.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fish in bulk for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T09:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T12:30:35Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970697,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886914,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436174,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130447,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027249,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613281,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010364,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232675,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664491,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105236,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T11:30:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":70536,"name":"Loeub","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Loeub P., age 48, is a widow who makes and sells traditional Khmer cakes such as Num Ansorm, Num Korm, and Num Bot.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

This is 35-year-old Zuhura W. K. from Tukuyu.  She is married with two children between the ages of 11 and 14 and is also responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents passed away.  Zuhura has been operating a shop since 2005, selling vitenge (see below), bedsheets, sweaters, blankets, and gowns. Assisted by her younger sister, she works 10 hours each day, 7 days per week, currently earning about $85 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy new clothing to sell, and in the future plans to have a big shop for garments. Zuhura thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nTraditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women is called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.
