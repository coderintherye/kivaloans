A. is from the village of Magcamiguing, Calamba, Misamis Occidental. She is 37 years old. Grace is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Grace sells food. She cooks food like fried eggplant, \"ginataang langka\" or jack fruit with coconut milk. After she cooks the food she puts it in cellophane and sells it  in the local community. Grace has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nGrace joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation with the ability to engage in business. Grace is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients for the food she cooks. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Grace from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Carmen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Carmen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Carmen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of San Carlos, Tukuran Zamboanga Del Sur.

Marivic has been selling vegetables and spices in the local community for more than 5 years, and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos (about $171 US) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marivic joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 pesos from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 12,000 pesos which will be used to expand the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Marivic from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and pay the tuition of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

artists, writers and sportsmen. The city has a priceless wealth of architecture and history and welcomes domestic and foreign tourists to see all the natural beauty that the city and its surroundings offer.\n\nThis bank is composed of both men and women entrepreneurs with a daily desire to overcome both at home and in their community to give their families a better quality of life based on values such as honesty, hard work and mutual support to achieve their objectives.\n\nMrs. Norma Lucia Court is a member of the Tocte Community Bank and lives in the town of Gualaceo on the outskirts of the city of Cuenca. She is 21 and lives with her husband and child of 1 year and 4 months of age. Her husband works as roof designer, and they jointly care for the house and live there but still do not own their own home.\n\nNorma splits her time between household chores and raising animals like guinea pigs and chickens to sell to her neighbors in the community and for consumption at home.\n\nShe has been with her community bank for three cycles and says that the loans have helped to buy animals and food. With this new loan provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, she will buy more guinea pigs, chickens, feed and vitamins for breeding in order to increase the size of her farm.\n\nMr. Luis Z. is the only man in his village bank. He lives in the parish of Jadan in the Tocte sector. He is 29 years old, is unmarried and lives with his parents who he supports financially a bit. He has a 6-year old for whom he covers the costs of living and study.\n\nLuis works as a roof designer and has his own workshop. He has been working for 12 years in this job. His hours are Monday through Friday. He also has a small stand at the local market where he mainly sells thread, needles, wool and more items for crafts.\n\nThis is his third cycle working with his community bank. He stated that the loans have greatly helped him to buy materials needed for his work. With the new loan provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, he is going to buy materials such as reeds to further develop roofs in order to keep his inventory stocked and to provide good service to his customers. \n\nHis big dream is to become a great trader.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Zal Bilimoria, Kiva

Teresa dreams of uplifting their living and being  able to send their two children to school and get a college degree so that they will have better opportunities for a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nFrom the time she got married, Teresa was the one who sold his catch to members of their community and sometimes even in the public market. Sometimes they get lucky and the customers are the ones who approach them to buy her husband's catch of the day. Teresa and her husband own their fishing boat, but in 1997, they needed money to do some major repair to their boat. This motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could access the necessary capital to fund their fishing operations. As she paid off each loan, she was able to borrow more funds to further improve their fishing business, buying new nets and other fishing gear. Now she is able to earn a net profit of PHP 10,000 per month from their fishing operations. She saves most of her profits for the education of her family, taking out only the most necessary funds to support their household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed Php 19,500 that she used as additional capital or revolving working fund for her fishing business. The loan was fully paid within her loan term without any delays in any of the weekly installments. Now for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing the same amount of Php 19,500 to be used for the repair of her fishing boat. She intends to use the income from it for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This has been the experience of Elvira A. of Canonoy, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Elvira is 49 years old and is married with four children who are between 18 and 25 years old.\r\n\r\nElvira's husband earns a living by fishing. Years ago, they owned a small unmotorized fishing boat that he had to paddle to go to sea. This was truly hard work, especially during stormy weather when the waves are a lot rougher than usual. But, because he had no other way to earn money to feed and support his family, he determinedly rowed his boat to sea everyday to catch fish, so that Elvira would have something to sell to people in their community and neighboring villages.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Elvira, with the consent of her husband, decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that they could borrow money to improve their income. With the new capital, Elvira opened a small general store so that she could earn a little more. As she made good on her loan repayments and established a good credit record, she was able to borrow larger amounts to improve her income potential.\r\n\r\nOne of their first investments from her loans was a joint decision to buy a motor for their fishing boat so that her husband could reach deeper waters and catch more fish - which he did. The motorized fishing boat and the income from the general store made a big impact on improving their family's quality of life. They currently earn a net monthly income of PHP 8,000 from their two business activities. The fishing business is doing quite well, so that Elvira and her husband are now saving up to buy another motorized fishing boat to increase their income even further.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned here, Elvira has kept a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. In her previous loan she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for their businesses and, as is her usual practice, she was able to pay it off within the loan term and without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is borrowing Php 15,000 so that they can finally purchase their second motorized boat. The income from it will be used to buy more productive assets so that they can continue improving their family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her husband originally earned a living from making wine from coconut sap (tuba) which they sold to people around the neighborhood. The couple is blessed with four adult children who are now between 28 and 34 years old, some of whom are gainfully employed and are therefore helping in the support of their family. Lucia hopes that she can continue improving their family's lifestyle through their family's collective hard work.\r\n\r\nAs a wife, Lucia always had a realistic view of their family's situation. She very well knew that the income her husband earned as a tuba maker was just not enough to cover all of their expenses and the increasing need for finances. Because they lived near the sea, Lucia decided that, if she had some capital, she'd engage in the buying and selling of fish to her neighbors and to people in the surrounding villages.\r\n\r\nTo get the necessary access to new capital, Lucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, and this enabled them to rent a fishing boat that one of her sons used for fishing, while she continued with her fish-vending venture. With the additional income they were able to buy their own motorized fishing boat soon after. This has enabled them to earn an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.\r\n\r\nHer Credit Record:\r\nLucia\u2019s previous loan of Php 12,000 was utilized as additional capital for her fish-vending business. The loan was fully repaid on time and within the designated loan term without any delays. Now, her 13th loan of Php 14,000 will be used to buy an engine for her fishing boat and to make a few repairs and maintenance work on it. The income from it will be used for the improvement of the family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying photo, Lucia is shown with the motorized fishing boat that her son just finished painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":424207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a

With this loan of PEN 1,500.00, she will buy: egg laying hens, vitamins, and also chicken feed by the sack to keep the birds healthy and fat and more productive. She feels very happy and appreciative because of the support and service that Movimiento Manuela Ramos provides and for helping people like her who want to work and get ahead in life. She hopes that they will be able to continue with this work for a long time and that they\u2019ll help many more families and enterprising women. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":427092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"She will buy feed and vitamins for her chickens.

She currently is in the same line of work in a rented space in the Central Market where she provides service to area residents and housewives.

He has many customers because he has worked this route for a long time so he knows the people who live nearby very well.  What he likes most about his job is the freedom it gives him for he can peacefully drive his minibus through the streets looking for customers.  He has been doing this for 10 years and feels that the most difficult side of the job is having to repair his vehicle when something goes wrong.  For the future, he would like to have a more profitable business, perhaps a car repair shop.  This is Lenin's fifth loan with MFP.  He knows he has to repay on time because he doesn't want to cause any problems for the other members of the communal bank where he is one of the few male members so he feels particularly obliged to be responsible.  With the 1,000 soles requested he will repair his vehicle's motor which, with the passing of time, has deteriorated.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":427235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"For engine repairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T06:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843189,"comment":null},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":335.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734779,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959843,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992688,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":165.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717471,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T17:19:44Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152979,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilda tiene 22 a\u00f1os, es soltera, vive en su casa propia, y lo que m\u00e1s desea es forjarse una buena vida.\nSu carisma es una de sus armas m\u00e1s importantes a la hora de desempe\u00f1ar su labor, ella es la encargada de cobrar los pasajes en la combi n\u00famero 12 que brinda servicio de transporte urbano por las calles de Juliaca.

He lives in a rented room and very much wants to get ahead in life and improve his future.  His workday starts very early, around 4am, when he goes out to earn his daily wage transporting passengers to their destinations in his minibus.  Together with his inseparable fare collector they travel the streets of Juliaca, following route #12, to reach their destination.  What he most likes about the job is to amuse himself traveling through the streets.  He enjoys driving so much that he decided to be a driver for a transportation company as soon as he became of age.  He has had this job for three years and considers the hardest part of the job is to be sitting in his minubus all day and not being able to do all the other things he'd like to do.  With time, he'd like to own and administer his own minibus.  This is Richar's third loan with MFP and he knows that he must repay on time and is prepared to do so.  He is considered very responsible in his communal bank and he does not want to let the other members down.  The 2,000 soles requested will be used to change his driver's license classification.  The rest of the money will be used for minibus repairs so that better service can be offered his customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":427246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"To change the classification of his driver's license.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T06:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":334.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843191,"comment":null},{"amount":233.1,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":669,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734781,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":334.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959845,"comment":null},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":334.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992690,"comment":null},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T12:59:49Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152982,"name":"Milagros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milagros is 52 years old and married to Gauvencio, a bus operator for Dagupan Bus.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kulazia is forty eight years old and is the leader of this group. She is a leading specialist in a social fund. Her husband works as a driver for a company.\r\n\r\nKulazia and her husband have raised three children. The eldest and the middle sons, 28 and 26 respectively, have taken after their father and work as drivers. The little daughter, 24, is a saleswoman. She is also getting distant education at university.\r\n\r\nIn modern times it has become quite disadvantageous to restrict oneself to have only one occupation. Kulazia is fortunate as fifteen years ago her little brother gave her eldest son a milk cow as a present. Kulazia started to look after the cow even though she was working at that time. Her little brother, having experience in raising livestock, showed them how to look after the cow since neither Kulazia nor her husband has ever looked after cattle before. Even now, her little brother still helps Kulazia look after the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, during these years, Kulazia has managed to increase their total cattle population. From time to time she would sell some of her cattle to make repairs to her house and to buy some convenience goods.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Kulazia hopes that she will be able to obtain this loan to buy one more milk cow to sell more milk and increase their cow population. One of her projects for the near future is to start building a big house.\r\n\r\nThe following people are Kulazia\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nAnarkul, 46, works in a social fund. She needs a loan to buy a calf. According to her, cattle are a good asset to help her children get on their feet.\r\n\r\nBubusaira, 60, is a widow and is the mother of three children. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nAzamat, 29, is married and has a two-year-old son. He works as a taxi-driver and needs a loan to purchase tires.\r\n\r\nSurakan, 47, is a widow. She works and raises cattle. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nKulchoro, 41, trades in various goods. He needs a loan to purchase office supplies to expand his assortment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Mrs T. is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. On this plantation she faces an obstacle because she does not have enough money to buy rice seed, fertilizer, and pesticides to support the field and to make the field more productive. Thus, Mrs. Kunthea T. has decided to ask for a loan for that purpose. She would use the rest of the loan to buy a pig and pig food for breeding. Her husband, Mr. Nob No, helps her in the business activities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":427317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy rice seed, fertilizer, and pesticides to support the field to make it more productive.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kunthea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222300},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":221600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":775312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626965,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":775312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128894961,"comment":null},{"amount":14.03,"local_amount":56100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57993.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159579877,"comment":null},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":222300,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":229802.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172059544,"comment":null},{"amount":55.4,"local_amount":221600,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":229079,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177350675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T01:28:59Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:38:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153003,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna R. is from the village of Pines Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.

She is divorced and has a daughter, 21, who is a college student.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, Dinara decided to become engaged in commerce. She had been saving money prior to her decision and, after saving some amount of money, Dinara invested it in purchasing goods. Now, she trades in foodstuffs and owns a small shop by her house.\r\n\r\nDuring these years, Dinara\u2019s trade has allowed her to live a decent life and even make a repair to her house. Her monthly income constitutes around $140. Now, her occupation lets her meet her daily needs.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dinara, aside from supporting her family, also has to pay for her daughter\u2019s education. The amount of the tuition fees requires Dinara to give at once quite a large sum of money, which she cannot do at the present time. Therefore, Dinara saw that the only decision was to apply for this loan. She hopes that this loan will enable her to save time and pay the tuition fee at once. Then her small business would allow her to gradually save money to pay it back.\r\n\r\nDinara has many plans for the future. Now, her only care is to give her sole daughter a good education. Then she is going to see her married. After fulfilling her parental responsibilities she is going to invest all her efforts in opening a bigger shop next to her house.\r\n\r\nDinara has three partners:\r\n\r\nElmira, 43, is currently unemployed. Her husband works as a tractor driver. Elmira has raised five children and the little child is just three years old. Elmira has applied for this loan to buy a calf to raise.\r\n\r\nMairamkul, 50, is a widow and is occupied with animal husbandry. She has two sons and the eldest son helps her  to look after the cattle. She needs a loan to buy a milk cow. An extra cow would allow her to sell more milk and increase her earnings.\r\n\r\nDilarom, 22, is divorced. She is sole supporter of her family which consists of her mother and sister. Dilarom works as a schoolteacher and needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

In these difficult times, with unemployment everywhere, and with many people at a loss for what to do, the example set by Gulnara is quite inspiring. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnlike many others she didn't just sit around and complain about her situation or look for someone else to hire her. She and her husband quickly realized that now is the time when people must create their own jobs - simple businesses that are easy to develop without the need for large upfront investments. Their parents were also able to help out since they had the experience and the means to support the initiatives of their children. It's been fifteen years now that Gulnara and her husband have their own livestock breeding business.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband had worked as a shepherd all his life. Currently he tends the herds and Gulnara manages the sale of their livestock. They raise and sell sheep. This was the business of their parents and they were the ones that first suggested to Gulnara and her husband to start raising their own livestock.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara raised three children. Her eldest daughter is already married. She is twenty-three years old. Her middle son is twenty-two. He is a construction worker in the city of Bishkek. The youngest daughter is fifteen and is a high school student. It was the livestock business that allowed Gulnara and her husband to purchase a house as well as have a wedding for their daughter. Currently their monthly income is around 2000 soms which is very little. However, the livestock that they already have allows Gulnara to look optimistically towards the future. Currently she has plans to buy another cow. She is hoping that this loan will allow her to complete this purchase. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese are Gulnara's group partners:\r\n\r\nBakir is 43 years old and has been in the livestock business for thirteen years. His wife works from home selling various household items. They have three children. All of the children attend school and afterwards help their father with work around the house. Bakir would like to purchase a calf that he could raise and sell.\r\n\r\nGulsun is 47 and she has one son who is twenty-three. Gulsun's husband works at the heating station. Gulsun herself raises sheep. She would like to buy a cow calf and that's the reason for her loan request.\r\n\r\nBubuaysha is 38. Her husband is a shepherd. Bubuaysha also has some livestock at home and sells milk. They have three chidren. The youngest one is two years-old. Bubuaysha hopes to get a loan to purchase an additional cow.\r\n<\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

For 10 years, she and her husband have been breeding livestock and trading in sheep. Then they invested about twelve dollars to purchase cattle. This investment has turned into a monthly income, which is 10 times more than the original amount. They have raised three children. The eldest daughter, 32 and the middle son, 27, both are married and live separately. The little son, 22, is a college student. He is the only one who still lives with parents. Jumakul\u2019s husband stays at home and is busy looking after cattle, whereas Jumakul goes to the cattle market and she is the one who makes all the purchase and sale deals. They used to keep and sell sheep. Afterwards they switched to horses. Animal husbandry has appeared to be a quite profitable business for Jumakul and her husband as due to it, they have been able to give all their children a proper education and marry their daughter. In recent times, Jumakul and her husband have noticed the tendency of people to buy sheep more than they do horses, as they are cheaper. They have applied for this loan and hope that by means of this loan they will be able to invest it in purchasing and breeding sheep. They hope to increase the total population of their cattle and marry their son in the near future. \r\nJumakul has three partners: \r\nDuishokan, 44, is a mother of two children. Her husband works as a taxi-driver. Duishokan stays at home and looks after cattle. She breeds a special strain of sheep called \u201cGissar strain\u201d.  Duishokan needs a loan to purchase one more sheep of that kind. \r\nZinagul, 50, and her husband work as dentists. They have four children. Zinagul is making preparations for her son\u2019s wedding. Therefore, she has applied for this loan to buy a sheep.\r\nNestandarajan, 47, is a housewife. She keeps some cattle at home and sells milk. Her spouse is a schoolteacher. He teaches geography.

She often works in the field with palm trees, weaving the leaves to form the roofs. Lucena has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2004, Lucena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.\n\nLucena is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 10th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They were blessed with five children, namely: Liberty, 30 years old; Carmita, 28 years old; Elmer, 27 years old; Carlota, 21 years old; and Carla May, 16 years old.\r\n\r\nTheir 3 oldest children are now working and the two youngest children will hopefully finish their studies in college. This is one of their dreams, that at least two of their children would become degree holders. That is why they\u2019re striving hard.\r\n\r\nIn order to augment the meagre revenue of her husband from working as a driver, Nenita runs a food preparation business. She is the one who personally prepares the food for selling. This business has run for 20 years now and she really wants this to continue for many years because this gives them additional income and has become a part of her life.\r\n\r\nShe became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) in 1995 and every loan that she received from this institution is used to improve her business. Now, her 7th loan will be used again to improve this business. She will use this for buying different things that will help to diversify her menu. She is hoping that all the things that she will buy using the loan will help her business to grow more.\r\n\r\nNow, Nenita\u2019s dream is that she has been able to save for the education of her two children. She really wants to give their children a better future and that is why they work really hard. And also she hopes that someday they will be able to renovate their house so they can experience living in a better house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":427374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To

C. is now 63 years old, still contented and happily living with her husband Aurelio C., 64 years old. In the long years of their marriage they were given three children: Fernando, 39 years old; Zenaida, 36 years old and Rowelio, 33 years old. One frustration for Gloria and her husband is that their children only attained a low level of education.\r\n<p>\r\nA good thing is that their two sons are now working abroad, so they will be able to send their children to school until college. Naturally, Gloria and Aurelio don\u2019t want their children to experience what they experienced in the past. Gloria, in her own little way, helps their children to make their dream possible for her grandchildren. She has run a variety store business for seven years, and she really wants this to continue and to grow more.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 she joined the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), and as a member she is entitled to loans. Every loan that she received in the past years of being a member was always used in improving her variety store business. Now her loan will be used to expand her business, because she will buy all the necessary things needed by her business like sacks of rice, different groceries and many more.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping that her business will grow so that they can turn it into a grocery store that can sell more things than a variety store. In that way, she could help her children in sending their children to school, and also help themselves improve their life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":427378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To finance

N. is from the village of  Pala-o, Iligan City. Ludivina is 37 years old, married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Ludivina owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Ludivina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ludivina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ludivina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ludivina from HSPFI.

Greshiel has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Greshiel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Greshiel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. Greshiel is requesting another loan of 4000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Greshiel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

is 47 years old and the mother of five children. Her family lives in the village of San Isidro, Ilagan, Isabela. For a year now, Mary has sold barbecue and other street foods in their village.  Her business has grown to the point where she is able to generate an income that covers her family's daily needs. However, she still wants her business to further progress, so she can save little by little for emergency purposes, especially since she and her husband are not getting any younger. Therefore, she is asking for a loan amounting to Php 6,000 from KIVA lenders for her business expansion. She knows that there are many people who are generous enough to help the needy like her, so she is optimistic that her loan will be granted.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":425955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

H., 53 years old, is married to Julio, who operates a welding shop in their village. They have three children who are all college graduates. The couple live in Zone III, San Mariano, Isabela. Tita hopes that their children will have a good future even without her and Julio's supervision anymore. Now that they are done with their studies she believes that they could make it on their own. However, Tita is ready to assist her children if they need her.\r\n\r\nTita makes a living through her poultry business. She raises chicks and sells them after 30 days. Aside from this, she also sells vegetables, fishes, meats and other commodities in their village, which she has been doing since their children entered college.

revolving capital of Php 8,000 to increase her products as well as her profits. She hopes to expand her business to meet the demands of her customers. According to her, she will increase the number of frozen foods that she retails whenever her loan is granted.\r\n\r\nMarcelita is a 30-year-old businesswoman. She is already married and has children of school age and hopes to be more profitable in her business to support the needs of her growing children.

Despite the inaccessibility of their municipality, being one of the farthest municipalities of the province, Angelina and her family have enjoyed having a very simple life and their bountiful environment.<p> \r\n\r\nHowever, Angelina is aware that life from now on will never be the same. Even in their village, several mining activities had opened and a lot of commercial establishments were built. Because of this industrialization, financial preparation occurred to Angelina. She has to be prepared financially for her 14-year-old son, whom she wants to graduate from college to be able to have a better career and to become competitive. Therefore, Angelina wishes to borrow a larger amount through ASHI to be able to grow her variety store and hog-raising business. Profits from her businesses will augment her husband\u2019s small monthly honorarium as the village councilor. Aside from her son to support, Angelina also wants to support a lot of grandchildren and change their lives from

A. is from the village of Inobulan, Salay Misamis Oriental. She is 54 years old. Rosalina is married and has adult-aged children. To make a living, Rosalina owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Rosalina has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalina is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosalina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is not just concerned about her family's way of life, but she is also concerned about the way of life for many people in their village. Through her small variety store business, she hopes to make it more convenient for people to access their basic needs, especially food. Their village is very far and is inaccessible to transportation, markets and hospitals. These concerns led Teresa to think of a business that would help people in their village. Therefore, when she had access to a loan through her membership in ASHI, she put up a small variety store. From then on, her business has not only been helping her own family through her profits, but also other families through the access to goods that she has introduced.\r\n\r\nTeresa wants to develop her business further through the loan she is requesting. She hopes that the time will come when her business will become sustainable and profitable to be able to achieve her personal dreams of educating her only child at college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

Tnadug\u2019s family income comes from rice farming and the selling of dried coconut or \u201ckopra\u201d in Filipino (Philippine language). It is her wish that her business will develop with the assistance of a loan. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a farm laborer and does not earn enough to take care of the daily needs of the family, especially the needs of their only child who is presently studying at college. For their child\u2019s education to be sustained until graduation, Gorgonia regularly requests a loan through ASHI to develop her business' profits. Being poor, Gorgonia at times is hesitant to take out a larger loan from ASHI. However, her determination to bring her family out of poverty gives her the courage to face the consequences, including the interest rate of her loan. Eventually, she will overcome the obstacle of being poor. She is able to operate a few businesses, just in case one fails. \r\n\r\nGorgonia will use the present loan for her hog raising and rice farming business. Income from her other business, selling \u201ckopra\u201d and vegetables, has enabled her to repay her loan from ASHI weekly including its interest. Seeing her only child continuously study in college is the fulfillment of the dream she keeps in her heart, and is the result of the hard work she does every day.

S. is from the village of Waterfall, Balingasag Misamis Oriental. She is 58 years old. Merlinda is widowed and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Merlinda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Merlinda has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merlinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Merlinda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She also makes home-made sausages and sells them to her neighbors.  She makes a net income of at least 3,000 Philippine pesos (about $64 US) a month from these businesses which she has been enjoying doing for years.  \r\n\r\nSince joining the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative early this year, Alili has been enjoying its many benefits for its members who are mostly housewives.  She is now on her 3rd loan cycle with CCT.  She is expecting to receive a fresh loan of 8,000 pesos from the cooperative which she will use to purchase scrap fabric from nearby garment factories as raw material for her trendy foot-rugs.  \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

He has plans to expand the store this winter, as he isn't currently able to display all his stock because of limited space. Rahmatsho tells us he's a fighter and that this line of work requires much sacrifice, as he must work everyday, including weekends, starting at 6 am and going well into the evening. In spite of this, he feels very fortunate to have his own business, to be able to support his family and to provide his children with a good education.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Said has worked in agriculture since he was young. He works even harder at it now because he has made his home with his wife and their four lovely children, whom he loves very much. Due to his high level of knowledge, Said takes full advantage of his parcels of land and also leaves them fallow sometimes so that the land will grow excellent products for him. It is for this reason that he is requesting a loan of $1000 to invest in seeds and mineral fertilizer for his crops (wheat and potatoes) and to take good care of his land. Said feels this is the only way to earn enough to ensure that his children can stay in school and have a bright future. Support this man of much strength and courage to keep working.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thus we came to Dakar and found a good location, where we can open a restaurant with a large seat capacity. Now that we have found the perfect location, we come to you and apply for the renewal of our loan. It will enable us to work on a larger scale and secure sustainable employment for each member of our group. We are very confident in our future, thanks to the experience we gained with our first loan.

For a dozen years, he's been living in the Agla neighborhood in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Camille is married to Anne-Marie ADJA\u00cf, a housewife. They have three school-attending children they have to support. Camille provides for the family alone. He dropped out of secondary school. To provide for himself and for his family, Camille has been a calligrapher in his neighborhood for about twenty years. In addition, he has a secondary business, dying clothes. He buys his supplies in Dantokpa, the international marketplace of Benin.

(greetings) from Tanzania! This is 29-year-old Alice S. from Mbozi. She is single with three children between the ages of 6 and 14. Alice has been running a business purchasing and selling crops and clothes since 2006. She works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week. Alice currently earns about $100 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve the quality and range of products she offers. Alice thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T06:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757662,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146756,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984901,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015574,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740580,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773694,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:15:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153320,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret sells cooked foods and drinks to make a living in her community in Ughelli, Delta state.
