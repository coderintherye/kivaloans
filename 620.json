is Andrea, 56, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Felipe, a cook in a food stall, and is the mother of five children. Four of her children are already working, while the youngest is in high school. By the grace of God, Andrea has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents; Andrea herself has been an undergraduate, and she believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAndrea maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Aside from direct selling, she sells breakfast every morning. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 510 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of Php 10,000. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAndrea fervently hopes that her child will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":799053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for orders and products that she is selling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-06-25T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2899.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474184,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2899.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636968,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3333.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3625.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005278,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1449.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-25T10:34:37Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310635,"name":"Jumwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jumwa is a married woman with four children.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippines pesos (Php) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Celia earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from the store, she is also into direct selling. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 470 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCelia dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands (dishes) cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 730 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDivina Gracia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and lot in a prominent subdivision in a nice location.

is Teresita, 45, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Fernando, a technician, and is also a stay-at-home mother who manages the household while she attends to her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a photocopying business. She finds that there is more need for her services now than previously as customer demand has increased. Her main customers are students who require her services for their schoolwork. She also has customers who require photocopying for documents, form replication and so forth. Her regular customers are students from the school near her business site and members of the local community. Teresita earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (PHP) profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Teresita is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy bond paper, toners and ink, and other supplies for her business. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy spare parts and pay repair fees for her photocopying machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of being able to give her all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

She is very active and performs her daily routine tasks with a great sense of responsibility. She is a mother of three children; two of them study and her youngest daughter is only one year old. \r\n\r\nShe lives in a combined family system along with her brother. Her brother has a rent-a-bike business. He rents motorbikes to people and charges on an hourly basis. His business is going well but he wants to improve it further.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

forty years old and she lives in Sevan. Narine is married and has two school-age daughters. When she graduated from Yerevan Teacher Training College, she worked as a kindergarten teacher for five years. Her husband works as an electrician.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, Narine opened her own business.  She sells souvenirs, toys, office supplies, costume jewelery, etc. She rents her shop.\r\n\r\nSevan is a resort city, so in the summer sales are brisk--especially in goods to take to the beach.  Therefore, Narine has decided to expand her business and to begin trade in beach accessories. In order to buy bathing suits, beach towels, hats, inflatable mattresses etc., Narine needs to take out a loan for 300,000 drams. This loan from Nor Horizon is Narine's fifth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":799235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy swimsuits, towels, panamas, air beds, etc. for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Sevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-06-23T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":21590},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23130},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":24130},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":24130},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":24390},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":24510},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25710},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25640},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":26130},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":26470},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":26810},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":21590,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":22179.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227363103,"comment":null},{"amount":63.61,"local_amount":23130,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":23761.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232865977,"comment":null},{"amount":702.02,"local_amount":255280,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":262253.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-28T17:09:03Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:08:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310717,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is 41 years old and married to Mbatha, and they are blessed with four children, aged 20, 16, 10 and 8.

Teolinda's favorite activity is serving in her business.\r\n\r\nTeolinda is very moved by receiving her 10th loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having repaid her previous loan satisfactorily, thereby having taken a step towards her business's growth. She has had her business for around five years. She set it up when she saved enough money to start a business and was immediately able to have her first Esperanza loan, all of which she invested in her business. \r\n\r\n<p>Teolinda will use this loan to purchase jeans, shoes and women's clothes such as blouses, skirts, underwear and other items.

Upon returning from buying them, she prepares them to bring them to the mill and being ready, at this stage she cooks the dough with butter and seasons them making sure her tamales are ready before 2PM.

She dedicates herself to the area of sales, specifically to her grocery store, located in her house. Here she sells fruit and vegetables, groceries, and cleaning progucts. She has dedcated her time to this for the past two and a half years. Before that, she sold vegetables from a stall in open air markets. Ingrid comes from a family of business people, from whom she inherited her trade. She buys her stock in wholesale supermarkets, from distributors, and from Lo Valledor (a market on the plain, where the products and prices are geared for selling to traders). Her working hours are from 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday, and she extends her hours until 11pm at weekends.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she has bought stock for her business, and construction materials with which to fix the floor and facade of the premises. Her goals for her business are to increase the physical space she has, to be able to stock it with more goods and thus increase her income. She comments that there are other commercial outlets nearby, but indicates that there is no direct competition.\r\n\r\nIngrid lives with her husband and her 10 year old son. Her husband helps run the shop. Her dream is that her son will complete his studies successfully so as to have a professional career. She also has plans to buy the house in which they live, because at present they rent it. Her motivation for continuing to build her business is to generate greater income and that way to offer her family a better socio-economic situation. \r\n\r\nIngrid is very happy and grateful for the support offered by Fondo Esperanza (the field partner); there is a very positive ethos within that institution.

When he left school, he learnt the dressmaking trade.\r\n\r\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric has been in the dressmaking business for 15 years and could provide for his needs and those of his children. Next to his activity, he sells nuts of oil palms. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric gets his supply of sewing articles at a market in Benin. Eager to satisfy the needs of their customers and increase their turnover and income, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and his fellow members of the group \"Lumi\u00e8re de Dieu\" applied for their second loan. They have repaid their previous loan on schedule.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":799406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing articles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Augustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76393.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221608286,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226977819,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232737199,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238541911,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501538,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251061892,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257112108,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:22:31Z","rounded_local_amount":38196.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263237247,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T16:44:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310880,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruth tiene 30 a\u00f1os, es natural de la ciudad de San Francisco,  vive en su propia morada al lado de su pareja Efra\u00edn de 33 a\u00f1os y sus 02 queridos hijos Jos\u00e9 de 05 a\u00f1os y Roci\u00f3 de de 02 a\u00f1os de edad a quienes desea brindarles una buena educaci\u00f3n para que en un futuro pr\u00f3ximo sean hombres de gran provecho.

She lives in her own home with her life partner, 33 year old Efra\u00edn, and their two beloved children.  Jos\u00e9 is 5, and Roci\u00f3 is 2.  She wishes to provide them with a good education so that in the near future they will become useful people.\r\n\r\nRuth is a woman who works arduously.  Every day she strives to give the best of herself to her household.  She works in agriculture.  She plants annatto, palillo (a condiment), coffee, and cacao on her land.  She has been doing this very carefully and laboriously for 18 years.   Thanks to the profits from her plants, she bought a half of a hectare of land in order to continue growing her crops.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, she bought fumigation machines to control pest infestations.  She feels that this work demands a lot of effort.  Therefore, when it is time to clear the fields and harvest she hires workers to help her with the work.  They need to pick the crops and prepare them to be taken to the collection centers.  The centers are in the cities of San Franscisco and Quimbirii, where she gets good payment for the grains she produces.  \r\n\r\nShe has some land that she does not cultivate.  It inevitably needs the support of the financial institution in order to carry on with her work.  She plans to plant her farmland with more coffee plants.  That is why she goes for the loans that the MFP institution facilitates for people with little resources who are looking to progress.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to have her characteristic strength and impetus in order to do good work to get her adorable children ahead.  This will be her sixth loan with MFP.  She hopes to have the support of the lenders in order to be able to make her plans a reality.  She pledges to make her payments punctually.  She is the president of her communal bank, and she watches over the members\u2019 progress.  She will use the requested loan to buy more coffee seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":799490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-26T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835449,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-26T19:52:51Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":310881,"name":"Atia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Atia is a married woman.

Marcelina resides in the green pastures of the village center where one can breathe fresh air and be surrounded by animal and plant life.  By maintaining her strength, Marcelina is able to work with great effort on her land.  She grows crops that are native to the Peruvian jungle such as citrus fruits, cacao, and coffee.  Her harvest is very productive because of her dedication.  Marcelina has been farming for 18 years and is an expert at working hard in the fields.  During the harvest season, she needs to hire workers in order to speed up the work.  She enjoys her job and the income she earns has allowed her to buy furniture for her home and acquire two more hectares of land for planting.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarcelina is requesting this loan to strengthen her farm so that she can gain more productive returns.  For this reason, she has utilized the loans that MFP provides.

This will be her sixth loan and she is very pleased to know that she has financial support.

He is in a common-law marriage with Conseulo, age 28, and their relationship resulted in two children.  They live in their own home made of basic materials such as wood and tin.  Uldarico carefully manages his parcels of green farmland surrounded by lush trees.  He grows cacao, coffee, and pineapples.  Uldarico has been farming for 12 years with the help of day laborers.  He says that as a young boy he learned from his parents how to plow the land.  Today he works on his own property.  The product that is most profitable is the sale of coffee because he is able to sell in bulk and at a good price.  With the profits he earned Uldarico was able to buy domesticated animals, such as donkeys, for transporting his products.  The period from June to August is when he can plant all types of crops.  For this reason, Uldarico approached MFP to request a loan so that he can sow more coffee and pineapple plants.  His plans are to continue farming and acquiring more land so that his family can overcome poverty.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his sixth loan and he is pleased to know that he has everyone\u2019s support.  Uldarico is confident that he can move forward with his plans.  He is a supportive member of his Communal Bank and helps to oversee the progress of his group.  This loan of 3000 PEN will be used to buy coffee and pineapple seedlings.

It is the second time that this group applies for financial assistance from the microfinance institution Alid\u00e9 in order to boost its activity level. Lucien is married to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who is in computers. He is the father of four children. Three of them are his own children. Some of the children attend school. Lucien enjoyed very little formal schooling, but he learnt photography skills.\r\n\r\nLucien has been working for ten years with great passion in the photography business, which enables him to provide for his family without major difficulties. Lucien lives together with his family. His customers have more and more needs, but Lucien has only limited resources and struggles to meet the needs of his customers as well as he would like to. Due to their limited resources, Lucien and his fellow members of Solidarit\u00e9 1 Group came to Alid\u00e9 and applied for their second loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":510.3,"image":{"id":799509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a camera.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-07-03T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"K.

He tends this with great dedication: he likes to plow the earth and sow the seeds that will grow in the following months. He doesn't like having to haggle over the prices in the main market in the town of Tarma, where he sells his produce. At the same time, he also raises livestock and has 4 milk cows. He makes 4 cheeses a day and sells them on Thursdays and Fridays in the markets that are held in his community. In parallel to this, he has 8 sheep which he is fattening to later sell for their meat at a good price to the local butchers.

His main crops are potatoes and peas that he grows on his own land.  This makes him good profits in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  In parallel with this activity, he also raises cattle.  Over all these years of hard work, he has managed to obtain 25 cows whose milk he uses to make an average of 30 to 40 cheeses a week which he sells to the dairy company \u201cLa Tarme\u00f1ita\u201d.  In addition to offering him a good price for his products, they also train him in how to continually improve the quality of his milk.\r\n\r\nOscar is happy with his achievements and he says that he would like to save the money he needs to be able to provide a better quality of life for his children who are young and studying university degrees.

In his spare time he works in public transport and covers the routes from the city of Santa Ana to his town, which provides him with extra income. \r\n\r\nHe would like to expand his crop lands and he is thinking of cutting down some trees, selling them to a joiner and obtaining some extra space. He is a member of the \"El Palomar al Exito\" (\"The Dovecot to Success\") communal bank and this is his fourth loan with MFP. He's hoping to obtain a small loan to meet his goals. He is also once more committed to repaying it as agreed, just like with previous loans. He enjoys being part of his communal bank because all members are responsible and supportive individuals. If he obtains the loan, Alejandro will invest the money received in the purchase of several bags of compost that he will spread among his crops, as well as in the purchase of a chainsaw to begin the process of expanding his crop land.

She is married to Gabriel, a driver, and mother of two children, one of whom is in college, while the other is in elementary school, a dream for most Filipino parents like Petronila, as she herself has been an undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nPetronila operates a firewood and charcoal retailing business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where firewood is used) to save money. Firewood and charcoal is way cheaper than LPG fuel, which in the current market costs as much as Php 600, and a lot of people in the provinces prefer to buy firewood, which is so cheap that it can be bought for Php 20 a bundle. Petronila also earns by selling the firewood to suppliers who buy it in bulk. More people are also switching to firewood which can be foraged or found in the trash. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of wood and charcoal to rebundle and retail to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPetronila dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her family and community with her as she continues to serve the Lord Almighty through her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married to Domingo, a vendor. She has four children; all now have their own families. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nJesusa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jesusa earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 386 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJesusa hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":799803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery products and inventory items needed in her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-06-25T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474189,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636973,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4333.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4349.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005283,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1733,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764451,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-26T13:21:04Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311002,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is married with six children.

He makes his home here in a simple structure with his long-term partner and their two children.\r\n\r\nMartire is excited to be taking his thirteenth loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid his previous loan and having developed his business by expanding his client base and by buying more products. He has had his business for around eight years, starting with the first loan he received from Esperanza, after some neighbors invited him to join the group. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business by purchasing pounds of fish and chicken to sell, as well as coconuts in order to sell their water. He will continue using his business profits to provide a better life for his family by building their house and by providing warm food, clothing, and for other needs.\r\n\r\nHis group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a burgeoning tourism industry, where most of the group members sell their products in their communities and surrounding areas.

is Francisca, 52, a resident of Pasay, Philippines. She is married to Manolo, a Public Councilor. She has four children who all now have their own families. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nFrancisca operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Francisca earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 37,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFrancisca hopes to be able to expand soon.

He is married and is raising four daughters, the oldest out of whom is 11 years old.  Muratbek was born in a simple family of a shepherd.  He was the oldest out of his brothers and had two younger brothers, which is why he spent a majority of his time doing household work.  Upon finishing school, Muratbek was drafted into the army.  Having served two years, Muratbek attended a local college and learned the profession of a wide-scope tractor operator and mechanic.  After finishing college, he got a job as a tractor operator at his native collective farm.  Muratbek got married in 1995 and had his first son this same year.  At first, Muratbek and his young family lived with parents up until the collective farm allocated a plot of land to build a house and land to grow agricultural products.  Muratbek put all of his efforts toward developing his farming business and was able to use his profit from the harvest to buy livestock.  Over time, Muratbek invested profits from reselling grown livestock into building a small house with all of the storage sheds necessary for the business.  When the collective farm dissolved in 1998, Muratbek decided to lease farm equipment and offer land treatment services to the public.  Muratbek's family is slowly growing, with their needs growing as well.  To better meet their growing needs, Muratbek decided to obtain a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) and buy a heavy-duty truck in order to offer transportation services to the public.  Currently, thanks to his persistence and hard work, Muratbek has three dairy cows, five bulls and four heifers.  Muratbek plans to buy his own tractor and increase the quantity of livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":799904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chaldovar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muratbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100710.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T14:44:42Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":311059,"name":"Juliah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliah, a married mother of five grown children, has been practicing mixed farming for the last 12 years in her hometown in western Kenya.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Aurea earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 17,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAurea hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of their motorcycle unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosita hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, electronic phone load, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling price and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nBasiliza dreams of being able to give her youngest child a quality education through all her hard work on her business.
