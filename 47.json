She says it\u2019s a challenge  to keep the store well stocked because of the demand for her products.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the products she sells are delivered directly to her store.  But she goes to the capital to buy products that are very expensive to stock locally. For example, a pack of disposable diapers costs about USD 13.00 in Guanuma but only USD 10.00 in Santo Domingo.  Because she stocks large quantities of those goods, it\u2019s better to buy them in the capital. The best selling items are plantains, bananas, manioc, cabbage, carrots, eggplants, rice, and other basic foodstuffs. \r\n\r\nKirudis supplements the household income with her profits. In this way, Kirudis and her husband (a lieutenant of the National Police) make ends meet and take care of their seven children.\r\n\r\nSome products that Kirudis sells daily are in short supply.  She needs funds to acquire some beans, rice, potatoes, oil, rum, and other alcoholic and energy drinks.

Agustina te Agradece tu ayuda."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":81604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buying merchandise to sale in Christmas season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe, Nuevo Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"25.683333 -100.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-11-06T21:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-20T23:46:10Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108562,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting)"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110944,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130198,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151855,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2008-04-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":175951,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1833.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203254,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-11-06T23:46:10Z","paid_date":"2008-05-07T09:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":23163,"name":"Korina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Korina is married with six kids that are all living together in one place with just two of them working.

It is located at a geographical location where most of the people work as a farmer, especially for Clove. usually the men will go out and work, and the female will stay at home and take care of the family, and only follow them when there is a harvest. However, Ni Putu Sukadani is not like the rest. She does not want to wait for her husband to put food on the table, therefore she started farming pigs. To increase her the quality of her yield, she has obtained financial assistance and training from Dinari. Recently, her sow had just given birth to 10 piglet.

Ni Putu Sukadani is optimistic that this will work out, therefor she works hard to ensure that this will increase their living standard. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa by Bernard, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Putu Sukadani tinggal di desa Manistutu, sebuah desa yang ada di Bali barat. Desa Manistutu adalah salah satu desa di Bali barat yang kondisi geografisnya berada di ketinggian sehingga banyak penduduknya yang berprofesi sebagi petani, khususnya petani cengkeh. Kaum lelaki pergi ke kebun untuk mengolah tanah perkebunan dan kaum wanita tinggal dirumah untuk merawat anak dan keluarga. Biasanya kaum wanita di desa ini akan ikut ke kebun kalau pohon cengkeh sudah berbuah dan siap di panen. Ni Putu Sukadani adalah sosok wanita yang gigih dalam mengarungi hidupnya. Ia tidak ingin hanya tinggal dirumah berdiam diri dan menunggu suami datang dari kebun. Untuk membantu menambah pendapatan keluarganya, Ni Putu Sukadani memelihara babi dirumahnya, khususnya babi jenis lokal.\r\nUntuk meningkatkan kwalitas dari usahanya, Ni Putu Sukadani mendapat pelatihan dan pinjaman modal dari Dinari. Saat ini Ni Putu Sukadani memiliki seekor induk babi yang baru saja melahirkan 10 ekor anak. Pinjaman yang didapatnya akan digunakan untuk membelikan pakan yang lebih baik dan bergizi, karena selama ini masih memberikan pakan tradisional sehingga pertumbuhan babinya tidak optimal.

To help ease her family burden Gusti Ayu Nyoman Ratniti started pig farming. However before this she didn't had the right knowledge to farm pigs, and didn't acquire maximum yield. She used to feed her pigs leftovers. However after receiving financial assistance from Dinari, she now rears 4 pigs and separate them into two sty to ease the job of cleaning. She also buys better pig feedings so that her pigs grows fat and healthy.

Begitu juga hal yang dialami oleh Gusti Ayu Nyoman Ratniti. Sudah menjadi tradisi wanita di desa, salah satu usaha yang dilakukan untuk menambah perekonomian keluarga adalah beternak babi. Namun yang menjadi kendala adala kurangnya pengetahuan akan beternak babi yang baik dan benar sehingga usaha yang ditekuni tidak menghasilkan dengan maksimal. Sebelumnya, Gusti Nyoman Ratniti hanya memelihara satu babi penggemukkan dan hanya diberi pakan tradisional yang berupa dedaunan dan sisa makanan di dapur. Hal seperti itu menyebabkan pertumbuhan babi tidak optimal dan tentunya berpengaruh terhadap harga jual. Setelah mendapat pembinaan dan pinjaman modal, sekarang Gusti Ayu Nyoman Ratniti memelihara 4 ekor babi yang dipisah dalam dua kandang. Hal itu dilakukannya untuk memudahkan perawatan dan pembersihan kandang. Pinjaman itu digunakan juga untuk membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga sekarang pertumbuhan babinya pesat dan sehat. Dengan adanya perubahan cara beternak, hal ini berpengaruh terhadap pendapatan keluarganya, karena sekarang ia dapat menjual babinya dengan harga yang lebih"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":81615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Membeli bibit dan pakan -

The members meet to discuss topics concerning their loans and businesses. This is also a time to do a lot of social networking. Since all are business owners, they tend to be very involved in their village and are often on other committees that support the well being of their communities. \r\n\r\nThe village of Mperewe is located on a very busy road on the outskirts of Kampala. Although the road bisects the town, it is very good for roadside businesses. The roadsides are alive with people selling hot food from small charcoal cookers, beverages from small huts, women selling bananas that they carry in baskets on their heads, boda boda (motorbikes) drivers offering rides as people exit matatoos (passenger vans). Everywhere there are people walking, visiting, trading, etc. It is a very vibrant place to be. \r\n\r\nSarah owns the Benoneto Shoe Wholesale, a wholesale shoe business.

Although it creates a bond in villages where everyone is caring for the children of deceased brothers and sisters, it also keeps people from being able to save and get out of poverty.  For most, it would be unthinkable to not care for the orphaned children.\r\n\r\nDeborah's lending group is meeting in the home of one of its members.  They are very business oriented and spend a great deal of time entering loan payments and discussing finances.  For many women in lending groups, this is their first exposure to borrowing and they take great pride in doing everything right.\r\n\r\nDeborah owns a paraffin business.  Paraffin is fuel that is pumped into plastic jerry cans which people bring to her site along the road.  Paraffin or fuel is used for cooking, lighting and as an additive to house paint.  Electricity can be very random, so paraffin for lighting the homes at night is critical.\r\n\r\nDeborah plans to use her loan to buy more paraffin.

At his store he receives large, pre-butchered slabs of beef and goat; no pork.  There is no refrigeration, so he must be sure to only buy what he can sell in a very short time.  Also, there is no way to avoid keeping flies and other insects from landing on the meat.  The slabs are placed on a hanging hook and he carves off the amount customers want and then weighs the amount.  I often wonder about the sanitary conditions of such places, but cooking well goes a long way to alleviating health problems.\r\n\r\nFrank serves a very important need in his community, for without meat people could easily be lacking in sufficient protein intake.

In the beginning she only has several chickens in the farm.  Those chickens were allowed to roam around and seek their own food.  Feeding is only done once a day, in the morning.  She couldn't make enough money by just selling eggs.  After joining DINARI Foundation, Komang S. obtained funding and training assistance on proper chicken farming techniques.  Ni Komang is trying to apply her learning.\r\nThe loan she obtains will be used to repair and expand the pen, so she can farm more chicken and feed more.  At this time she has 50 egg producing hens and 5 roosters.  She spends about $1.70 for feeds that consists of rice, corn and concentrate.  She earns $4.44 a day by selling eggs.  She may earn net profit of 2.75 per day.  From this profit, Ni Komang S. can supplement income from her husband, Gusti Ketut Sumantri, and pay her 2 children's tuition.

Hasil telurnya pun masih belum maksimal. Dengan bergabung dengan Yayasan DINARI Ni Komang S. mendapat bantuan dana dan pembinaan budidaya ternak ayam secara baik. Ni Komang S. mencoba menerapkan apa yang sudah didapatkan dalam pembinaan dari Yayasan DINARI. \r\nDengan dana  tersebut kandang mulai diperbaiki dan diperbesar lagi, jumlah ayam diperbanyak , pemberian pakan pun dilakukan secara teratur. Saat ini jumlah ayam petelur sudah mencapai 50 ekor dan ayam pejantan 5 ekor. Biaya pakan dalam sehari mencapai Rp.15.000,-.  Pakan ayam terdiri dedak padi, jagung dan konsetrat. Hasil penjulan telur dalam sehari dapat mencapai Rp. 40.000,-  Keuntungan bersih dalam sehari mencapai Rp. 25.000,-. Dari keuntungan inilah Ni Komang S. dapat membantu penghasilan suaminya, Gusti Ketut Sumantri, dan dapat membiayai pendidikan kedua anaknya. Rencana kedepannya akan memperbanyak jumlah ayam peliharaanya, sehingga keuntungan dapat lebih meningkat lagi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":81965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Chicks to be Grown","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-10T13:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-24T18:11:12Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T02:08:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94397,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T06:40:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111486,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T07:20:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129064,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T07:30:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154063,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T06:25:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182677,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T03:01:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213673,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:05:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246051,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275662,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305202,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336181,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":50,"local_amount":428571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T06:30:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":457118.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368415,"comment":"Ni Komang sunistri finally repaid the rest of the loan.

Martin","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The micro-entrepreneur Rogerio Mart\u00edn C. is 45 years old, lives in the city of Bluefields, is married and has three kids.  Two study in primary school and one at the secondary level.  For the past six years he has dedicated himself to the jewelry profession, making rings, earrings, gold chains, as well as repairing these same products.  Currently he has a large quantity of requests for graduation rings but due to lack of money he cannot buy the stones and gold needed to make them.  This demand for rings is because in the months of November and December many High School graduations occur and as a remembrance students buy rings with engravings alluding to their respective schools.  In order to facilitate the purchase of his products, Mr. C. allows customers to pay for the rings in four or five installments, since for many parents it is difficult to pay the total cost of these rings all at one time.  Micro-entrepreneur C. employs one other person who he pays a head of the household (full-time) salary. The cost of the square stones used for rings is $2.00 U.S. each, the stones for graduation rings are valued at $3.00 US, a pound of plaster costs $2.00 US, and a gram of gold can be purchased for $8.00.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl microempresario Rogerio Mart\u00edn C. tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en la ciudad de Bluefields, es casado y tiene 3 hijos, dos estudian en primaria y uno en nivel secundario. Desde hace 6 a\u00f1os se dedica a la profesi\u00f3n de joyero fabricando anillos, aretes, cadenas de oro, as\u00ed como la reparaci\u00f3n de estos mismos productos. Actualmente tiene una gran cantidad de pedidos de anillos de promoci\u00f3n pero por falta de dinero no puede comprar las piedras y el oro para su elaboraci\u00f3n. Esta demanda de anillos se debe a que en los meses de noviembre y diciembre se realizan las graduaciones del nivel secundario y como recuerdo los estudiantes compran anillos con grabaciones alusivas a sus respectivos colegios.

She raises and fatten pig in her yards to support her family's income.  From her farm income, she managed to afford high school tuition for her 3 children that now can support themselves independently.  She pays so much attention on her 2 pigs that she is growing, so that the 2 piglets she purchsed for $50 can now be sold for $100, the net profit of about $35 can be used to afford the ever increasing living expenses.  Ni Ketut is also thinking of her old age, when she will not be as productive as she is now.  Ni Ketut plans to improve her farming techniques and expand her farm by adding more pigs.  She also needs more money to pay for feeds that are becoming more expensive.  She hopes to achieve all these using the loan from DINARI, which may help her optimally expand her business.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunter <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nNi Ketut Suarmi terbiasa dengan kehidupan yang selalu diisi dengan kerja keras. Walaupun sebagai wanita  biasa, tetapi Ni Ketut Suarmi tidak mau tinggal diam saja melihat suami bekerja keras untuk menghidupi keluarga. Ni Ketut Suarmi ikut ambil bagian dalam mengusahakan kesejahteraan keluarganya dengan memelihara babi penggemukan di sekitar pekarangan rumahnya. Karena keuletannya, Ni Ketut Suarmi mampu menyekolahkan 3 orang anaknya sampai mereka tamat pendidikan menengah dan akhirnya bisa bekerja untuk mencukupi  kebutuhan hidupnya masing-masing. 2 ekor babi penggemukan yang dipeliharanya diperhatikannya dengan sangat baik sehingga dari dua ekor bibit yang dibelinya dengan harga Rp 450.000 dalam waktu 2,5 bulan mampu dijual dengan seharga Rp 900.000 dan keuntungan bersih yang diperolehnya sekitar Rp   300.000 dan itu dipakai untuk menutupi biaya hidup yang semakin tinggi. Ni Ketut Suarmi juga memikirkan hari tuanya yang tentu saja tidak bisa seproduktif seperti sekarang, sehingga Ni Ketut Suarmi pun berusaha keras untuk mengelola usahanya dengan baik  yaitu dengan berencana menambah jumlah ternak yang dipelihara serta  menyediakan stok pakan yang memadai karena harga pakan sudah semakin mahal. Dengan menjalin kerjasama dengan DINARI lewat pinjaman modal usaha, Ni Ketut Suarmi  melihat peluang untuk mengembangkan usahanya untuk mendapat hasil yang maksimal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":82260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase feed and piglets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-11T01:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suarmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-25T07:59:45Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T02:18:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94401,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T06:40:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111490,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T07:20:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129067,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T07:30:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154069,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T06:25:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182682,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T03:01:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213678,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:05:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246056,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276636,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T06:58:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305963,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":273285.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":337224,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":21,"local_amount":180000,"processed_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":191300.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371139,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

All of her three children realized how hard the parents work so two of them try to be independent and earn their own livings.  Her youngest child is still in primary school, so she still need to pay for his tuition.  She saw the opportunity to expand her pig farm.  She started with only one pig, and now she owns 3 growing pigs.  Each pigs were bought for $25 and farmed for 2 months before sold to a butchery or restaurant for $45.  So she earns about $60 from 3 pigs.  Jero Darsini plays a big part in earning the family income as her husband's contract farming income is not sufficient.  She hopes to expand her farm and increase her profit.  She hopes to use the loan from DINARI to achieve that.  Jero Darsini is trying to renovate her simple home using the additional profit from the business.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nJero Darsini dalam kehidupan sehari- harinya terbiasa untuk bekerja keras dalam membantu suaminya, Gusti Ketut Rauh, dalam memenuhi segala kebutuhan hidup keluarganya. Tiga orang anaknya sudah merasakan bagaimana uletnya orang tua mereka ini hingga dua diantaranya sudah mampu mandiri dan bekerja, sedangkan anaknya yang masih di sekolah dasar masih harus di biayai pendidikannya. Dari keuletannya dalam menjalankan usaha ternak babi, Jero Darsini melihat ada peluang untuk bisa mengembangkan usahanya. Dimulai dari hanya memelihara seekor babi sampai akhirnya  Jero Darsini memelihara 3 ekor babi penggemukan. Babi tersebut dibeli dengan harga Rp 225.000,- per ekor yang  dipelihara selama 2 bulan  dan di jual kepada pengusaha babi guling dengan harga Rp.400.000, jadi Jero Darsini mendapat pendapatan kotor Rp 525.000 dari ke 3 ekor ternaknya. Dari hasil usahanya inilah Jero Darsini menunjukkan perannya menjadi penopang keuangan keluarga karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai petani tidak cukup untuk memenuhi semua kebutuhan keluarga. Dalam perkembangan usahanya Jero Darsini selalu berharap bisa lebih maju lagi karena kebutuhan hidup semakin meningkat dan lewat pinjaman modal yang diperolehnya dari DINARI besar harapannya bisa mengembangkan usahanya karena Jero Darsini juga sedang berupaya memperbaiki keadaan rumahnya yang sangat sederhana ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":82265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase growing pigs and feeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-11T01:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jero Darsini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-25T05:13:34Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2600000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":216666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":216666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T02:22:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94402,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T06:40:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111491,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T07:20:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129068,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T07:30:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154072,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T06:25:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182687,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T03:01:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213684,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:05:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246063,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276637,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-25T06:58:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305958,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-25T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":337225,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":216666.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":227738.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371140,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

a 32-year-old widow, supports her two children, ages 16 and 11, in order that they may attend school.

Mary sells sugar, soap, cooking oil, and salt, along with personal hygiene items, at the mini shop in her village of Kikajjo on the outskirts of Kampala. Many of the retail stores sell very similar products. There are at least two reasons. First, the needs of people with little means are not varied; they are buying essentials, not luxuries. And second, one does not want to take a risk and fail at a business, as there is no safety net. So, you stock what you know will sell. Currently, Mary's inventory of products is low, so she plans to use her loan to replenish her stock of cooking goods. <p>Mary is also the treasurer for the Nyikira Okole Women\u2019s Lending Group. Lending groups are quite common in villages. They act as a kind of peer pressure to encourage members to make sure they make their repayments on time.

Often the beer is made in-house. Beer is made with millet, sorghum or bananas, with yeast added to the first two versions but not to the bananas. The bananas are first covered with banana leaves and buried in the ground for 3 days. Then they are unwrapped and cooked slightly and reburied for 3 more days. Then they are brought out and mashed in a cut-out log and put into ceramic jars and allowed to ferment for 14 days.

A little while ago, bad luck struck her home: her daughter's epilepsy became more apparent, and the price of her daughter's medications has called Elizabeth to work even harder. Therefore, to help her children, she is asking for a loan to improve the harvests and the amount of maiz she grows. You can help keep this family a happy and close one, reach out to her so her children's smiles never leave their faces. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Joanne Egnatchik, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Elizabeth, es una mujer luchadora y trabajadora que trabaja muy alegremente.

worked as a nurse for 15 years, but she began to have arthritis in her hands and knees from the work and had to quit the job. As a single mother, she still had to take care of her three children and provide for their education, so she started selling used clothing and toys in January 1987. She had some sales experience because previously she had sold cosmetics in her free time. Back then, she needed to sell many items to able to cover her expenses, so she went to the outskirts of local markets (she couldn't afford to pay for a post inside). With a lot of hard work she was able to set up outposts in all the open markets in the region and a larger space to sell her goods. <p>\r\nWith Christmas time fast approaching, Alicia wants to offer a wider variety of the toys children want. She is requesting a loan of $850, which she plans to repay within six months, to purchase more supplies for her customers. With your help Alicia can grow her small business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nAlicia trabaj\u00f3 15 a\u00f1os como enfermera pero comenz\u00f3 a enfermarse de reumas en las manos y en las rodillas por el esfuerzo que hac\u00eda en el trabajo y tuvo que dejar de trabajar, pero como es madre soltera de tres hijos, y ten\u00eda que mantenerlos y darles estudio, comenz\u00f3 a dedicarse a la venta de ropa usada y de juguetes.

Lacking a higher education, Alma and her husband thought about starting their own business to help solve their household expenses and provide for their two small children. Her husband is a fisherman, so they thought of having a seafood business at a local fish market called La Puntilla. They have since acquired a post in the market, and little by little they have established their business. <p>\r\nWinter is by far the most difficult season to sell seafood, with the supply dwindling and the prices rising. So Alma is requesting a loan of $575, which she will repay within six months, to purchase fish and seafood so they can have more merchandise. With your help, Alma, her husband and her children will be able to have Thanksgiving dinner and be happy they're together and no have to worry about money.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nAlma es una persona muy fuerte, con deseos de salir adelante y muy emprendedora. La falta de estudios de su esposo y la de Alma los oblig\u00f3 a pensar en poner un negocio para  tener un ingreso que les ayudara a solventar los gastos de su casa y sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos. El esposo de Alma era pescador, por eso pensaron en poner un negocio de mariscos en un mercado de pescados y mariscos (llamado La Puntilla),desde entonces han seguido con su local y poco a poco se van estabilizando. <p> \r\n\r\nSin embargo el invierno para un vendedor de mariscos es la \u00e9poca m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, puesto que la pesca se va haciendo m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a y por lo tanto los precios de los productos se hacen m\u00e1s altos. Por lo tanto Alma est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $575 para pagarlo en un plazo de 6 meses y con ese dinero poder comprar los pescados y tener material para surtir en el mercado. Con tu ayuda Alma, su esposo y sus hijos, podr\u00e1n tener una cena de acci\u00f3n de gracias en familia y felices por estar juntos y sin preocupaciones de

time ago, Eleuterio worked as a truck driver, but downsizing in his company resulted in him being fired. This left him and his family without money to survive. With a lot of effort and with help from relatives, in 1991 Eleuterio and his family opened a general store, and little by little they began to increase their inventory and clientele. Thanks to the attitude of all his family, the business has become well known among the people who live in Sabinas.<P>\r\nHowever, like all businesses, this one has good times and bad times. Recently, they had many expenses, and so the store was left with a very low inventory. This is why they are requesting a loan of US $475, to be paid in 6 months, to be able to buy merchandise to have a better variety of products. With your help, Eleuterio and his family will be able to succeed.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHace tiempo, Eleuterio trabaj\u00f3 como chofer de camiones de carga, pero un reajuste en su empresa, hizo que lo despidieran, dej\u00e1ndolo a \u00e9l y su familia sin dinero para sobrevivir, y con mucho esfuerzo y la ayuda de sus familiares en 1991 Eleuterio y su familia comenzaron a vender productos de abarrotes, y as\u00ed poco a poco comenzaron a crecer el repertorio de sus productos, y haci\u00e9ndose de clientela.  Gracias a la disposici\u00f3n que tiene toda su familia, el negocio est\u00e1 haci\u00e9ndose m\u00e1s conocido entre la gente que vive en Sabinas. <p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo, como todos los negocios tiene temporadas buenas y malas, y actualmente tuvieron muchos gastos, por lo tanto la tienda de abarrotes qued\u00f3 con muy poca mercanc\u00eda, por lo tanto est\u00e1n solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $475 para pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses y con esto poder comprar mercanc\u00eda para tener mayor surtido en sus productos.

With time she realized that the business would grow little by little if she would put enough time into it. And so it was that she kept working hard, until she was able to make it what it is now, a well-known business in her neighborhood.<P>\r\nHowever, Olga does not want to fall into conformity, and that is why she wants to grow her business a little more, since the business is becoming an important source of income for her family and this motivates her to keep growing for everyone's future. For this reason, she is requesting a loan of US $475 to be paid in 6 months. With this money, Olga will buy merchandise to sell a greater variety of products in her store.
