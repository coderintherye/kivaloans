She took this loan to purchase cribs, toys and additional supplies.  \r\n\r\nSylvia knows she has a promised flow of children through the municipality.

She dedicates evenings to her children helping them with their homework, especially the youngest.

Innocent is 52 years old and married with four school-aged children who all attend school.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

Imelda is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Imelda's first loan from ASKI.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and blessed with five children. She shares four rooms with her five children in Nchulam, a quarter in Bamenda, in the northwest region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nMariana has faced many difficulties in her life, ranging from ill-health, to the inability to meet her daily needs, to failure to attain quality education, to sickness in  her seedlings. Among other challenges, she also has had difficulties with inadequate capital to start up a business of her own. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy a motorcycle which she will use for transportation. She also thinks her business will succeed because in the area where she resides, there are no motor-able roads, but motorcycles can access the area smoothly with little or no stress. She will also use it to bring farm products from the interior to the markets. She will also regularly undertake contracts to transport farm products to homes within her locality. Her activities will help her community because they will be able to transport their farm produce with relative ease from farm to market, and transport supplies from market to farm.\r\n\r\nShe will use a fraction of her profit to carry out maintenance and fuel the motorcycle. She will use the remaining proceeds to upgrade her family standard of living and pay for her children's education. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":585.73,"image":{"id":658944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

With this loan she is going to buy two phones and transfer the credit and related bonus in the two phones which she sells to her customers. She believes the business will succeed because the previous loan she took was repaid by the income raised from an old phone of hers.  Therefore, she concludes that she is sure the business will succeed. She is certain that this business will succeed because the services she renders are in high demand in the market. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford food ingredients.\r\n\r\nR. will plough part of the profit back into her business and use part to care for her family.

It\u2019s part of San Pedro Jicayan municipality and is located 50 minutes north of Pinotepa Nacional.  This town is inhabited in its totality by Mixteca indigenous people.  They preserve their traditional dress as well as their traditional customs and behaviors.  In this population one can admire the creation of various textiles that display the colors particular to the people who live here.  Another characteristic of this population is that one can find many musicians here as well as artisans who make crafts from wood, gourds and textiles making this a unique place.  The group has 11 members, all women.  The name of the group representative is Rosa H. M. but the group member we will feature is Mrs. Albina Dami\u00e1n Dionicio.\r\n\r\nShe is a 29 year old housewife, married to a 29 year old farmer named Rodolfo.  She is mother of two children, Juan, 6, and Idalia, 11 months.\r\n\r\nAlbina was married at the age of 13 and her work consists of weaving traditional costumes known as \u201cnaguas\u201d and \u201chuipiles\u201d which are currently considered artesanal handicrafts.  She learned this skill when she was 10 years old; it is something little girls in this community must learn so that when they get married they can make their clothes.\r\n\r\nAlbina lives in a small house maD. of adobe and raw mud.  The roof is roofing tile and cardboard sheets.  It does not have a firm cement floor.  This type of dwelling is typical of the area where poverty reigns and the lack of basic communication infrastructure, like paved highways and widespread supply of electricity, is the norm.\r\n\r\nAlbina joined this credit group that formed near her place of residence because she needed resources to buy the materials she uses to make the \u201cnaguas.\u2019\u2019 She used the resource to buy cotton thread in white, purple, maroon.  Some of the thread, like the purple one, is produced internally.  They dye the threads using a marine snail known as Purple Snail.  She also bought other kinds of embroidery thread like \u201chilo vela\u201d and \u201chilo Madeja\u201d in assorted colors that she used to make napkins.  She also replaced some parts on her loom.\r\n\r\nAlbina dreams that her children will grow healthy and go to school.  She aspires to improve her house with better quality materials as well as to improve her living conditions.  She\u2019d like it if her crafts were known among more people and that she be paid a fair price for them; that they don\u2019t take advantage of the situation those who have little are in to buy at prices below what is fair.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are unassuming, humble women who only wish to get ahead and change the panorama of poverty for one of a better life.  They are committed to their dreams and believe in the goodness of others.  They are people who studied enough to be able to read a few things or to be able to write their names or perhaps never even stepped foot insiD. a school.\r\n\r\nAlbina, smiling, thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, Kiva and all those people who help the dreams of poor people come true.  Thanks for helping indigenous people from the Oaxaca coast.  They send a sisterly hug.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the names and activities of each of the other members of the \u201cJicayan\u201d group:\r\n\r\nAlbina Dami\u00e1n Dionicio. \u2013 Manufactures Artesanal Textiles\r\n\r\nSabina Bruna Dami\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez.- Manufactures Artesanal Textiles\r\n\r\nFidencia H.

Esta emprendedora mujer se despierta muy temprano para empezar con la atenci\u00f3n en su negocio de venta de abarrotes y especer\u00edas que tiene en un mercado de su zona. Se dedica a esta labor desde hace 13 a\u00f1os y el tiempo le permiti\u00f3 captar buenos clientes, quienes acuden a su establecimiento para comprar los productos b\u00e1sicos que ofrece, entre ellos los no perecibles, pues son ofrecidos pues saben que son frescos y de buen precio.

Sin embargo, sabe que el esfuerzo tiene su recompensa pues ayuda a su esposo en los constantes gastos del hogar.

Together they work hard to improve their circumstances. This entrepreneurial woman wakes up very early to attend her business, selling groceries and spices in a market in her zone. Lidia has been doing this for 13 years, and time has allowed her to capture good customers who frequent her business to purchase the basic products she offers, including perishable items, as people know that they are fresh and are sold at a good price. What Lidia doesn't like about her job is that she neglects her household tasks, because she passes a large part of the day in the market as she must sell a large quantity of goods to assure her earnings. Without doubt, Lidia knows that her efforts are rewarded as she helps her husband with the regular household costs. As she is an entrepreneurial woman, in the future Lidia plans to expand her business's facilities to offer the best to her customers. This is the second loan she has had from MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually as she doesn't want to have a bad relationship with the people that made the loan possible, as this loan will allow her to continue working in search of progress.

It is located in Nepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, in Tepetlixpa, in the State of Mexico.  This group has 6 female members who know each other and are neighbors.  The members are Mrs Juliana V. D. who will use her loan to buy sheets, bedspreads, pillow cases and comforters to sell, Mrs Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez who will buy chips, sugar, oil, milk, soup and cookies to stock her business, Mrs Sandra A. Mart\u00ednez who will buy corn to resell and also invest in fried pork crackling and cr\u00e8me caramels, Mrs Yolanda God\u00ednez E. who will buy denim pants, blouses, shirts and sweaters to sell and to start her business, Mrs Asela V. C. who will buy spare parts for her taxi and Mrs Yolanda S\u00e1nchez who will buy natural products (Herbalife, teas, food supplements and shoes to sell).\r\n\r\nAsela is 48 years old.  She studied up to the sixth year of elementary school.  She is single and has one son called Gerardo who is 22 years old, married and works.  Asela has a taxi and she is requesting her loan to buy spare parts for it, have it tuned, change the spark plugs, oil filter, air filter, gas filter and buy tires.\r\n\r\nAsela is a taxi driver.  She offers her services to the general public and works on the \u201cEmiliano Zapata\u201d route.  She started her business 8 years ago.  First she learned to drive then she started her business providing a taxi service to the general public.  Some friends encouraged her and she likes her work.  She adores it!!\r\n\r\nThe challenges that she faces are the high costs of spare parts and tires and also the fact that she has a lot of competition as there are a lot of taxi drivers.  She uses her profits to cover her household expenses and personal expenses, and she also saves for spare parts and to make her loan repayments.  She is planning to expand her business.  She would like to buy another car and hire it out for work.  She is planning to achieve this through working and finishing making repayments on her loan, as well as asking for another loan.\r\n \r\nNepantla de Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz is very quiet.  It is the town where Sister Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz was born.  Many tourists come to visit the Sister Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz museum.  There are a lot of trees and the climate is cold.  This business has helped Asela's family.  She also helps her mom financially.  She would like to make some improvements to her home such as extend it, do some cosmetic work on the outside of the house and add an extra room.  Her plans and hopes are to finish paying off her loan and not work so much.  She would like to hire the taxi out for somebody else to work in.  Asela is very happy with the loan that she is being given because she will be able to have her taxi tuned and keep it in good conditions so that she can provide a better service to her customers.  The improvements that she would like to achieve for her children are to leave her business to her grandchildren and her son.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \u201cThank you.  Thank you very much for the loans which you have given us and we hope you continue helping more people with your loans\u201d."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":657622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy spare parts for her taxi, tuning, spark plugs, oil filter, air filter and gas filter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-06T23:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3625},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7252.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691520,"comment":null},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7252.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430704,"comment":null},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7252.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849979,"comment":null},{"amount":587.5,"local_amount":7250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7252.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T19:46:25Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":255427,"name":"Marvin Aristides","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marvin Ar\u00edstides de 36 a\u00f1os, es una persona la cual debe trabajar muy duro para sostener a su extensa familia la cual esta conformada por su esposa y seis hijos, todos menores de edad.

Every day they work hard to improve their life. For 18 years, this self-starter has worked selling snack foods and snow cones. Every morning she prepares her cart with treats, soda, and snow cones. She starts selling her wares outside of a high school starting at 8 o'clock. After noon she moves to another school and makes sales there until four in the afternoon. She says that she is satisfied with her job as an ambulatory food saleswoman because she makes regular profits that allow her to help her husband cover their household expenses. She knows that hard work pays off because their hard work during this time has allowed them to buy their own house, and she has plans to finish building the house with better materials and to install a snack shop there so she can sell her goods from a stable location. This is will be Alicia's second loan with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments punctually because she does not want to let down the people who have supported her and allowed her to continue working towards her own success. She is planning on using the loan to purchase sugar, flavors, and other ingredients that she will use to prepare snow cones during the summer.

For them the sensational phenomenon of dawn is linked to the hopes and expectations that each one of them has to arrive at a new day and just like interest is renewed so is the grace of living one more day in humans.  This is how the members explain the meaning of the name.  It is composed of 10 women and one man.  All are from San Miguel Tlacamama located 25 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  It is known for the cheeses made in the area that are highly appreciated by locals.  Most of the people are associated with cheese making and also farm work.  The group meets in one of the member\u2019s homes where cheese is made daily.  The group representative is Minerva Irma E. Mart\u00ednez but in this case we will emphasize another group member\r\n\r\nMartha L. A., 34, is a hardworking housewife.  She is the daughter of humble field workers and is married to Javier, 35.  She is the mother of four children: Ana Laura, 16, Marisol, 15, Honorio, 11 and Gustavo, 3.  Only two of them go to school because the oldest was unable to go to school this year due to lack of resources; she helps her mother in the small business they have.\r\n\r\nMartha has been selling low-cost meals for over two years.  This activity has become her source of income.  Profits are directed primarily to provide continuity to the business, to repay her loan and to pay for her children\u2019s educational expenses.  It is also a way to help her husband because his salary as an employee is insufficient to cover the needs of four children and themselves.  This is why she decided to go into this business which, although it is close to home, still implies much work and dedication because her meals stand out due to their special savory touches.  We can find her daily at her business cooking up soups, mole and adobo and in the evenings, regional snacks like sopes, tacos and tostadas.\r\n\r\nMartha joined the group in order to obtain credit to invest in her business.  With money she was lent she bought some ingredients like: assorted chilies, tomatoes, onions, vegetables, fruits, leafy vegetables and grains like beans, rice, corn to make tortillas, oil, salt, sugar and canned goods.  To date everything in her business is running very well and she expects tourists and people on vacation to come through town during the next vacation period.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her daughter will be able to restart her schooling next term and that the business continues to grow; that her sales don\u2019t drop so that she can continue to guarantee a good living condition for her family.  She\u2019d like to have a restaurant where she does not have to pay rent that would mean a solid support for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat Martha can add now is that thanks to the collaboration from all the good and noble people she has been able to improve the living conditions of herself and her children.  She thanks the people who gather together to do good for others.  She sends greetings to everyone that supports Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and asks God to keep them.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a list of the names and activities of all the members of the \u201cLa Aurora\u201d group:\r\n\r\nFrancisca V\u00e1zquez. \u2013 Fast food sales\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe E.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is from the village of Unidos. She is 47 years old, married and has 7 adult-aged children. Elizabeth owns and operates a business providing general equipment rental to local community members. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elizabeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to invest in expanding the business. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Elizabeth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Perlita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is from the village of Manamong, Aloran, Misamis Occidental 7209. She is 60 years old, widowed and has 5 adult children. Benedicta is involved in  the agricultural sector, in particular farming. She has been engaged in her business for more than 25 years and earns approximately 5,000  pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn February 15, 2007 Annaliza joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business.\r\n\r\nBenedicta is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used as additional working capital. This will be her seventh loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of Php 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

D. is from the town of Trinidad. He is 52 years old. Victor is married and has a 22-year-old. To earn a living, Victor makes and sells \"bahalina\" (coconut wine) to his community. Victor says \"bahalina\" sells well in his town. He hopes to be able to expand his business, though, and get more customers. \r\n\r\nVictor joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.
