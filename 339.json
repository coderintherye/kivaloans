Paterna is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, fertilizers, and young crops to raise. This loan will be the 3rd loan Paterna has taken out by from PMPC, and this is her second loan from Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":472737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Her kiosk now has some windows to display her products.\r\n<p>\r\nCatherine likes her business because it allows her to talk to and get to know many people - both clients and neighbours - and thanks to good sales she is now able to help out with her household's expenses and with the finances to help finish their house's construction.  She is very grateful to her parents and will stay on with her partner and watch over her parents' future.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she plans to study dressmaking and set up her own workshop at home, as well as keeping on selling sweets.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth credit with MFP and she affirms that she will carry on being punctual with the repayments, as she is very grateful to the members of this bank who have given her the opportunity to get loans.  The money that she is asking for at the moment is to buy biscuits, soft drinks and some other merchandise for her business.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":472777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more merchandise\/Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T18:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124473,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960214,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":427.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993058,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717844,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751520,"comment":null},{"amount":149.4,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":425.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933988,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-19T21:03:55Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169505,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gregoria tiene 60 a\u00f1os, su esposo falleci\u00f3, y actualmente vive con dos (mujeres) de sus 4 hijos.

They have two children, Luis, 19, and Melody, 12.  Six years ago Marisa and her husband decided to start a hardware business.   They located their shop in a central area of the city which is always busy.  In the beginning they suffered a lot, not earning enough to even pay their rent.  Marisa's husband began to offer and resell their products to other hardware stores for a minimal profit, never imagining that this model would actually be so successful.   Now, Marisa doesn't work in the shop, as she is busy handling the billing and processing of the orders they receive.  Sometimes it's so busy she counts on the help of one of her nephews, usually in the afternoons when there are more customers.  For the future, Marisa would like to set up another location.  Their model works well and she would like to build the business and help bring more financial security to her children.   This is the 9th loan she has received from MFP and she's always made her payments on time.  She also likes the comfort and sense of community she gets from the communal bank, and she gets along well with other members.

She lives with her life partner and her two children: Jeycel, 7 years old, and Yamile, a few days old. She has a house of her own, still not fully built, located in a populated neighbourhood south of Lima. \r\n\r\nShe is an ambulant retailer. She has been selling vegetables for 5 years in her district's market. When she first started she had to find a place to locate her stall. At first everybody was very envious because she had found a place inside the market with actually owning a stall, which aroused the jealousy of other sellers, but Nancy was patient and persistent. Every day, after her work was over, she left her space very clean, thus winning the trust and affection of the market managers, and later she got her own space. \r\n\r\nHer  daily routine begins at 3 am, when she wakes up to go to the wholesale vegetables market, because by 7 am she has to be already placing her fresh wares in the market. \r\n\r\nNancy likes her job very much and she knows that with a lot of hard work she can finish building her home and improve her children's quality of life. \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP. She is sure she will continue to meet her repayment terms punctually, as she wants to be able to depend on future loans because they are very useful tools for her trade. She means to invest the money she asks for in increasing her inventory, as well as renovating the wooden boards she uses to showcase her products. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cecilia Piris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":472801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Increase of inventory and improvements in the stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T16:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124480,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960221,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":427.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993065,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717851,"comment":null},{"amount":150.12,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":427.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751526,"comment":null},{"amount":149.4,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":425.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933994,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-19T18:28:56Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169515,"name":"Jenefer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenefer C. is from the village of Cawa-cawa.

Jesila is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers for the crops and as start-up capital for raising pigs.

S., 44, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs. She is married to Oscar S., a carpenter, and they are blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. Together, they have been selling wood furniture for many years.\r\n\r\nTeresita has been a regular member of Kiva's partner Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 13 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy more wood and lumber.   Her business lets her earn a profit of 8,500 Philippine pesos per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like a PHP 22,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for buying more wood and lumber for her expanding furniture business.\r\n\r\nShe prays that they will have earn enough resources to fix their house and that their children will have a better life in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":472809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

In the field, the family has some problems because their crops have been damaged by insects.  Moreover, the field has infertile soil, but the family does not have sufficient money to buy supplies to change this. Thus, Mrs. Mealea M. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers and pesticides.

S. is 28 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in Tosontsengel soum in the Zavkhan province of Mongolia. The family lives in a \"ger\", or traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His oldest daughter, 6, attends a local primary school while his wife stays at home with the youngest daughter, 2. Zorigbaatar is an extremely busy young man who currently operates three businesses. During the warm months, he operates a car washing service, charging between 2,400 and 4,000 tugrugs (1.5-2.5 USD) per car. During the winter months, he operates a skating rink and charges his customer 500 tugrugs per hour to skate. All year round, he uses his carpentry skills to make and sell wooden products.

Aged 60, she has a long experience working in small restaurants. Her aunt on her father's side introduced her to the business, teaching her the trade.\r\n\r\nMs. N. sells breakfast, lunch and dinner and would like to use part of her loan to replenish her stock of poultry and meat. The other part she will invest in her side business: selling hair weaves.\r\n\r\nEach member of the group receives 100,000 FCFA for their business. Like Ms. N., Seynabou F. also sells hair weaves; Ms. Fatma F. sells breakfast items (e.g. sandwiches with bean-spread, mayonnaise, eggs, etc.); Ms. Maguath F. sells frozen juices; and Ms. Baba Coumba L. sells fish. \r\n\r\n\r\nL'Association des Femmes pour le Developpement d'Entreprises (AFDE: Association of Women for Business Development) is a cooperative of small-scale traders working in Thies, a city about seventy kilometers from Dakar. The Association was founded in 1993 by twenty entrepreneurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and to organize a tontine. A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.\r\n\r\nThe tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC. For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer. These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations. The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":472420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To replenish

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty female entrepreneurs in order to increase their purchasing power by means of a tontine (a revolving finance system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and these funds are passed on in rotation to different members). Since this policy does not allow for the financing of all members on the same day, they decided to join l'U-IMCEC (an association of mutual savings and loans institutions) in order to obtain a loan without being asked for guarantees. The members have thus formed sub-groups of five women, with a designated president and a treasurer for each sub-group. These sub-groups, of which there are currently 52, may remain the same for many years, but often change members in line with their needs and other considerations. The AFDE organises monthly members' meetings to which all the sub-groups are invited, and it manages a cooperative for its members, which allows them to buy rice and other products at a better price. The AFDE is run by a president whose name is Mrs. Mame Diarra MAR and a treasurer, Mrs.Ndeye Ndella Diouf, both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nMrs. A\u00efssata N., married and mother of four children, is the president of AFDE sub-group N\u00b0 11. She has been running a business for the past seven years through the influence of a friend. Mrs. N. is 44 years old. She hopes that her activity will supplement the quite insufficient family income and improve living conditions for her children and her five-year-old grandchild she has under her care since she was born.\r\n\r\nShe sells food products such as fruit, jujube, \u2026\r\nHer sub-group also includes:\r\n\u2022\tMrs. CoumB. Laob\u00e9 B\u00e2, who sells thiouraye (incense)\r\n\u2022\tMrs. CoumB. Kant\u00e9, who sells charcoal, peanut butter, palm oil\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Awa S., who sells beauty products, and\r\n\u2022\tMrs. Fatou D., who sells breakfasts.\r\n\r\nThey are requesting a loan of 500,000 FCFA for their businesses, which will amount to 100,000 FCFA per person.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty female entrepreneurs in order to increase their purchasing power by means of a tontine (a revolving finance system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and these funds are passed on in rotation to different members). Since this policy does not allow for the financing of all members on the same day, they decided to join l'U-IMCEC (an association of mutual savings and loans institutions) in order to obtain a loan without being asked for guarantees. The members have thus formed sub-groups of five women, with a designated president and a treasurer for each sub-group. These sub-groups, of which there are currently 52, may remain the same for many years, but often change members in line with their needs and other considerations. The AFDE organises monthly members' meetings to which all the sub-groups are invited, and it manages a cooperative for its members, which allows them to buy rice and other products at a better price. The AFDE is run by a president whose name is Mrs. Mame Diarra MAR and a treasurer, Mrs.Ndeye Ndella Diouf, both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nThe president of AFDE No. 10 is Mrs Ndeye Marie N.. She sells womens' clothing and cosmetic products. Single without any children, Mrs. N. has been carrying out this business for two years in order to be self-employed and to fight against financial dependence. With this loan she is planning to buy women's clothing and cosmetic products in the Gambia and she will sell these to her customers. The other members of the sub-group are: Mrs. Aminata F., who sells palm oil, peanut butter, shoes and bags; Mrs. Khewe N., who sells dried fish and palm oil; Mrs. Souadou Dram\u00e9, who sells clothing and perfumes; and Mrs. Sokhna N., who sells clothing and breakfasts. They are applying for a loan of 500,000 FCFA from the lenders and will divide this equally between them.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

M\u1eabn Th\u1ecb is a 30-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two infant children.  To make a living, L. operates a restaurant, serving breakfast foods to customers in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately $233 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  L. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant.  \r\n\r\nL. is now requesting a new loan of 7.804.000 VND, which again will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant.  This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.  L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

H. has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately $94 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. \r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 4.704.000 VND, which again will be used to purchase raw materials.  This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.

Now, she has established a small stall in front of the house and presently earns an average net income of not less than 3,500 PHP, which is so helpful for their family. \nMarpie joined Kiva partner PMPC because she was very interested in its various products and services. With good credit performance from her first loan, she was given the privilege of borrowing 8,000 PHP as her second loan. She will use this loan to add to her capital for her sari-sari store and as capital for her dried fish vending business.

Martine is married to Nic\u00e9phore AKOGBETO, a printer. The couple has three children who are all at school. All the children live with their parents in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Martine is able to help her husband with the upkeep and education of the children, thanks to the income she gets from her business. Martine attended school up until secondary level and afterwards learnt to sew. She has been carrying out this activity for around 17 years. Aside from this, Martine sells various products (canned foods, pasta, sugar, soaps, peas, liqueurs) as well as haberdashery products in her workshop which is in S\u00e8nade in Cotonou. Martine stocks up in Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market. Martine is an old client of ALID\u00e9 and repays her loans without any problem. Martine wants to strengthen her capital and diversify her business further.

Jeanne has been living at Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9 in Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin, for six years. She is a widow raising 5 children, of whom 4 are her own children. All the children are enrolled in school. Jeanne lives by herself with her children in Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9. Jeanne is the only breadwinner for her family, using the income she earns from her business. <P>\r\n\r\nJeanne was only able to go to primary school. She has been working at her business for about 7 years, selling cereals (rice, beans, maize meal). She also sells detergents and soaps, which allows her to add to her earning capacity. She sells these products at the Avotrou market in Cotonou and buys her goods in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin. She has been a client of ALID\u00e9 for a long time, having already received from this institution 4 loans, which she reimbursed correctly. Jeanne's clientele is continually growing, but she is not able to satisfy their needs since she does not have much working capital. For this reason she is requesting a fifth loan to bolster her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty entrepenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and to organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.  \r\n\r\nMs. Rokhayatou D. is the young president of her group, Afde No. 13.  She had studied hotel and restaurant management, but found it difficult to find a job, and hence began her current activity of selling clothing.  She buys fabrics, which a tailor then makes into clothes. In turn she then sells the clothes to her clients.  Ms. D. has one child, aged 5.  Ms. Aissatou Fatim N. is the group's treasurer.  Her main activity is selling juices, which she prepares from bissap flowers and monkey bread (baobab fruit).  Each group member will receive a loan of 100,000 FCFA for their business.

is a 28-year-old man who lives in Saida in southern Lebanon.

This tall (or short) water pipe is used to smoke fruit-flavored tobacco. Ahmad requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his shop, like a billiard to attract younger customers and make his coffee shop a nice place to hang out and have a good time. This is his fourth loan cycle, and he has always paid on time. \r\n<p>\r\nAhmad's previous loans helped him start a new business selling scrap metal. This second business is a way to improve his income. Ahmad is an active man who does his best to improve his family's financial situation, and he even said that if he had more time, he would consider starting a third job. \r\n<p>\r\nAhmad is special in his work, because his clients feel comfortable coming to his shop and enjoying a nice coffee or drink with their narguileh. His clients are his friends, neighbors, passersby, and people from his region. When he first started his business, he had difficulty purchasing all the necessary merchandise for his shop. He decided on doing his business, because he wanted to have independent work.

She is 29 years old and married to Hector, 31, who is a fisherman. She is a loving mother to two children who are both minors. She lives in the town of Binangonan, Rizal Province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Cristela joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-financial institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of obtaining start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loans in ASHI, she carefully invested in her fishing business and it gave her a reasonable income.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, Cristela requests 15,000 PHP for the revival of her fish-raising business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase a fishing net, rope, bamboo, fingerlings (young fish) and labor expenses. This loan will help to reconstruct her fish cage, which was destroyed by the huge typhoon \u201dOndoy\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, Cristela dreams of sending her children to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for a better living. She also enjoys seeing how the loan from ASHI will change their lives and accommodate her family's needs. Through the support of ASHI, Kiva\u2019s partner, she will, step-by-step, realize her dreams. She also dreams that soon she will have a larger space to store her fishing materials.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":473052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To

The couple share in supporting the family.\r\n\r\nFor the past ten years Lise has been selling various products from her home-based shop in Agla : concentrated products, pasta, sardines, milk, peas, mayonnaise, couscous, rice, soap, candles, etc..

Married to C. Joseph Zangronio, a security guard, Suzanne is the mother of six children who all go to school.  All the children live together with their parents in Yagb\u00e9.  The income brought in by her business enables Suzanne to help her husband with the family expenses.  Suzanne attended school up until high school.  \r\n\r\nFor about 10 years, Suzanne has been selling corn and hot peppers out of her house.  She also sells peanut oil at her house, thereby increasing her sources of income.  Suzanne gets her supplies from northern Benin and also from Dantokpa, Benin\u2019s international market.  She has already received three loans from ALID\u00e9, which she has paid back.  Suzanne would like to strengthen her capital and increase her product stock to better cater to her clients, but she doesn\u2019t have enough funds to do so.

For his wife as much as for himself, Jerem\u00edas looks to his bakery as a great blessing for his family, as it provides them with a means to earn the money they need to pay for all the expenses of their home and family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":473138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Compra de harina, manteca, levadura y un horno.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Cojutepeque en el departamento de Cuscatl\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T19:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerem\u00edas Azarias ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123866237,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128899064,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136627237,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144661303,"comment":null},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-24T07:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151845743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-19T22:38:29Z","paid_date":"2010-07-24T07:26:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169712,"name":"Ana Lisbeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana Lisbeth is 43 years old. She is married and lives with her husband and five daughters in Desemparados, San Jose, in the central valley of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThis is Lisbeth\u2019s second loan with Fundacion Mujer. Her first was for 1,000,000 colones over twenty-four months and was dispersed in 2003. Lisbeth owned a corner store but, unfortunately, she had to close down the project because three mini-supermarkets opened in close proximity to her small store. The competition was too much and she was crowded out of the market.\r\n\r\nNot to be deterred by the breakdown of her first enterprise, Lisbeth has since opened a beauty salon named \u201cLisbet\u2019s Salon\u201d. She has two years of experience working in salons and so, five months ago, she decided to open her own business. For the last five months, she has been working hard to keep the salon profitable.\r\n\r\nBusiness hours are from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Tuesday to Saturday. Lisbeth works alone in her salon and offers a range of services including manicures, pedicures, haircuts and hair extensions. In a good month she earns 400,000; in bad months 160,000. The loan officer that has been working with Lisbeth describes her as hardworking with a fighting spirit and a strong history of punctual repayments.The current loan will be used to invest in her new business.\r\n\r\nLisbeth is applying for this loan to reinforce her working capital. She will use the loan to invest in general activities conducive to the growth of her salon. This last year was hard on business but in January her products and services have become popular in her community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Lisbeth will use this loan to buy a swivel chair to replace her old one in an effort to provide better service to her clients. She will also use the loan to purchase various products necessary for hair alterations, manicures and pedicures. Lisbeth says her only obstacle is economic.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":473141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

In fact Xekh Niakh is a wolof expression which means to conquer poverty.\r\n\r\nSubgroup Xekh Niakh no. 27 is managed by Mrs Sadio Gu\u00e8ye and comprises 6 members, all from the same family; the father is the only man in the group. They are asking for a loan of 500,000 FCFA to be repaid over ten months in order to finance their individual activities. This loan will allow  Mrs Sadio Gu\u00e8ye, the president, to buy palm oil, brooms, and peanut butter, which she has been selling for three years in her neighbourhood. And the profits which she expects to make from this activity will allow her both to build up her stock and to cover her needs and those of her two children, who are 11 and 6 years old. Mrs Gu\u00e8ye who is married and 39 years old, thinks that the success of the previous loan that they repaid ahead of schedule has motivated the members of the group to ask for another loan. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Mrs Bineta S., the treasurer and their mother, who sells cloth, plates as well as juice and cream;

","en":"Boox Xalat is a group of ten women who own businesses operating in various sectors. The group was set up just one year ago and it is chaired by Mrs Ndeye Fatou S., who has been an elementary school teacher for the past eight years. The group members are women of the same neighborhood. They help each other and share a strong feeling of cohesion for the greater good of their \"private kingdom\".\r\n\r\n\"Boox xalat\" is a Wolof expression which means \"sharing a common idea\". The group joined the Thi\u00e8s branch of the microfinance institution U-IMCEC and applies for a loan of 500,000 CFA francs. Each member will receive an identical share of the loan and use it to finance her business or personal family needs.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman, Mrs Ndeye Fatou S., will use her loan for personal needs. She will invest it in the business of her sister-in-law who cannot take advantage of the institution's financial products due to lack of proper identification documents. Her sister-in-law sells couscous, which is in high demand in her neighborhood. Thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase millet and ingredients needed to prepare couscous. Mrs Ndeye Fatou S. is highly respected by her peers thanks to her generosity. She is the mother of two children, aged 4 and 2.

She has been selling for more than 5 years, which she started at the same time that she started her college studies with the goal of helping her mother.  Previously, she also sold cosmetics, mostly to her friends, but her friends started asking her for clothes, so she decided to sell those products instead.

Calder\u00f3n is from the San Juan de Limas municipality.  She devotes herself primarily to raising livestock.  She works in a loan cooperative in San Juan de Limay.  Because she is an accountant she is in charge of the bookkeeping.  She got the loan to buy four calving cows because she wants to get more earnings from the milk sales she currently has.  The business began when she was working as a secretary.  With help from her husband, she started raising livestock.  Her husband grew crops and raised livestock.  Clara Olga is currently a widow because her husband died.  Running the small farm now falls to her and her children.\r\n\r\nClara Olga works everyday, Monday through Saturday.  She expects that with the purchase of the cows everything will go very well for her.  She will increase the sale of dairy products, and that will generate more income.  This way she plans to be in good standing with Ceprodel, and she will improve her farm with the earnings.\r\n\r\nClara is a widow with three children.  Two of them are in the university.  This is her fifth loan with Ceprodel in a period of five years.  She has paid very well.  She tells us that the loans with Ceprodel have helped her very much because they have improved her family\u2019s living conditions.  Also, she has been able to increase production on her farm and get a better profit.  She plans on continuing to work so that her children can get ahead.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":472483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy four calving cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T20:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":22000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":311.13,"local_amount":6367.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6499.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128926630,"comment":null},{"amount":192.26,"local_amount":3934.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4016.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136654296,"comment":null},{"amount":571.61,"local_amount":11697.96,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":11940.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177381792,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-19T23:11:18Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:22:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169725,"name":"Angela Asunci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela es socia del  al Banco Comunal Pedregal desde hace 13 ciclo, este banco esta  ubicado en la provincia de Manab\u00ed en la costa ecuatoriana,  ella vive en Picoaza y se dedica a la venta de legumbres en el mercado de Portoviejo su jornada laboral empieza muy temprano  desde las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana esta en pie para ir a vender, el lunes es el \u00fanico d\u00eda que no sale al mercado.\n\nNo es nada f\u00e1cil realizar este trabajo comenta \u00c1ngela, pero ha sabido sacarlo adelante con la ayuda de su familia pues ya lleva 15 a\u00f1os laborando  en el mercado.

Her major target groups are the travelers who ply the road to their destination. Those travelers purchase the kenkey in bulk.

Marguerite did not attend school.  For about 10 years Marguerite has been in the business of selling fabric, as a traveling vendor and at the Vedoko market in Cotonou.

Rosario has been selling oil and eggs for the past year. Most of the members work hard to surpass the competitors because their homes' support depends upon it. \n\nThe loan will be destined to increase the working capital in their businesses and invest in the purchase of raw material and merchandise to continue growing and generate a better profit that will enable them to offer their families a better quality of life, a stable home and a good education for their children.

The members are very united and active entrepreneurs who want to carry out credit activities to develop camaraderie and unite more as a group.  Yovana is the group president, and has been selling cosmetics for the past 3 years, Cristina has been working at a paper supply store for the past 20 years, Marleny has 3 years of experience selling cosmetics, Isabel has been selling soda on the street for the past year, Martha has been selling pots for plans for the past 2 years, Elena has been working at an internet cafe that offeres local and international phone calls for the past year, Patricia has been selling clothing for the past 4 years, Elizabeth has been selling cosmetics for the past 10 years, Carmen has been selling underwear for the past year, Dory has been selling salte\u00f1as (Bolivian meat pastries) and running her business for the past 20 years, and Adela has been running her paper supply store for the past 15 years.  Some do their activities in their own homes, while others are traveling merchants.\n\nAs far as competition goes, we can mention that their competitors are present in the neighborhood.  The members have their loyal customers who constantly generate the economic movement that is necessary to support themselves.  In case it is not going well in the neighborhood, they go to other locations like fairs and neighborhood markets so they can meet their own obligations and those of their families.\n\nThe loan is to stock their stores buy purchasing merchandise, work material, and supplies in greater quantities.  Then they will be able to generate better earnings that will allow them to give their families a better quality of life.  As far as experience goes, the members are completing their second cycle.  They demonstrate responsibility, honesty, and the desire to get ahead to improve their businesses.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

H., 46, was born in Cartagena de Indias, a colonial and touristic city in the Latin Caribbean. It has a sunny climate beaches with warm waters, and is located in the extreme northeast of Colombia. Norbertina has a 19-year-old son, and lives in the Los Calamares neighborhood in the southwest of Cartagena. Here, the proliferation of enterprising businesses, the happiness of the residents, and the fulfillment of their credit obligations are the common denominators. For this reason, the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo is well known in the area.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Norbertina has been very enterprising. Her parents with great effort managed to provide her with a primary education. She then continued on her own with secondary school education and a career as an office technician. This experience taught her the importance of education, and she now directs all her efforts toward providing a university education for her son.\r\n\r\nWhen Norbertina concluded her technical career, she thought it might be more profitable to work independently, so started a business selling general merchandise. She began as a low-volume business, as her income did not permit her to buy in large quantities. She gradually built up her working capital and her customer base in the market until she was generating enough income to support her household.\r\n\r\nNorbertina felt she needed a strong push to generate more growth. At this point, she approached la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo who helped her with working capital and business training. Her first loan, in 1994, was for $110,000 COP, and since then she has added 25 more individual loans to her working capital.\r\n\r\nLike all persistent entrepreneurs, Norbertina says that it was difficult starting out from zero and she invested much time and effort to finding customers for her products. At the same time, she had the parallel responsibility of her home and son, as her husband works outside the city in the office of an ironworks. \r\n\r\nNow, her reality has changed. She says, \u201cMy family environment and my income have improved notably. I am thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With them, I have found the opportunity to work independently and to study a technical career. My advisors have been very special, and I have managed to pay for my son\u2019s university studies.\u201d\r\n\r\nNorbertina dreams of continuing to advance her son\u2019s education and of becoming a micro-business leader in the development of projects for other entrepreneurs. She would like to give back to society and the Foundation part of the benefits she has received. \r\n\r\nNorbertina would like to expand her business to all of the city of Cartagena and even other cities in Colombia, becoming a wholesale distributor of imported goods. She wants to generate enough income to maintain her home in the best possible condition.\r\n\r\nThis loan, for $1,200,000 COP will pay part of a semester\u2019s tuition for her son, who is in his sixth semester in the field of public accounting. The hopes of bettering the quality of life for the family are with him.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":473398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"University education for her son","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T14:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norbertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":189827},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":194991},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":198241},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201545},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":204904},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":210492}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.87,"local_amount":189827,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":194523.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913406,"comment":null},{"amount":101.56,"local_amount":194991,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":199815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949012,"comment":null},{"amount":103.25,"local_amount":198241,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":203145.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677805,"comment":null},{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":201545,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":206531.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712177,"comment":null},{"amount":216.35,"local_amount":415396,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":425672.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895683,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T15:25:58Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169824,"name":"Buen Corazon Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las socias del grupo \u201cBuen Coraz\u00f3n\u201d est\u00e1n representadas por la se\u00f1ora Cleta y conformada por 10 miembros que hacen uso de su nombre ya que son personas de un buen coraz\u00f3n, din\u00e1micos y muy solidarios, una gran mayoria de los integrantes son padres y adres de familia por lo que siempre piensan en el futuro de sus hijos es por eso que muchos de ellos salieron de sus \u00e1reas rurales para probar suerte en la ciudad.

Now, let's get to know this group a little better.  Yulissa and Barbara will share their stories as small businessmen.\r\n\r\nYulissa is 30 years old; working everyday seling bread, cakes, and cookies was difficult since she didn't earn much money.  She sold many of her goods on credit and her customers took a while to pay her.  These difficulties motivated her to change professions and to sell ceviche and chica morada (a local drink) on the corner by her home; this has gone much better for her and she has earned more than she initially thought she would thanks to her good cooking and the fact that there is little competition where she sells.  Currently, she works from a cart that she purchased with loans; she was also able to purchase new utensils, buckets, pots and a display case.  She would like to continue to improve her business by purchasing a mobile kiosk to more easily serve her customers.  She needs a loan to buy it, fix it up, and paint it.  Her earnings help to pay the costs of raising her children as she would like to proviD. for them the best she can.\r\n\r\nBarabara is 57 years old and sells anticuchos (cow heart kebabs) and picarones (fried pork) in a local park.  She has been able to pay for the education of her two children through her business.  She was forced to work when her husband passed away; before that, she had no need to work.  Before she started selling anitcuchos, she sold school supplies but she didn't make much money.  She decided to help her mother selling anticuchos (a Peruvian delicacy).  She will use the loan to buy ingredients like: cow hearts, spices, cow stomach, skewers, etc.  Her youngest son is studying to be a pharmacist; Barbara's brother supports him in his studies because her earnings are only enough to cover his food and their home expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":473490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Barbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segura Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yulissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4950,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1237.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":2475,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2479.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899700,"comment":null},{"amount":431.42,"local_amount":1238,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933783,"comment":null},{"amount":431.08,"local_amount":1237,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661376,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-04T03:37:04Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":169868,"name":"Angela Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Angela Isabel L\u00f3pez  labora arduamente en un Instituto en Managua, ella tiene tres  hijos a su cargo, y  dos de ellos se encuentran en edad escolar, es madre soltera y ha trabajado  cr\u00e9ditos con CEPRODEL durante seis a\u00f1os, en este periodo de tiempo ha invertido seis cr\u00e9ditos en la mejoramiento de la vivienda en la que habita, gracias a los financiamiento otorgados por CEPRODEL.  \n\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado actualmente es para invertir en la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n como: piedra, cemento y arena, para la construcci\u00f3n de  un muro en la parte trasera del patio de su casa.\n\nElla realiza dicho cr\u00e9dito con el objetivo de brindarles mayor seguridad y  una mejor condici\u00f3n de vida a sus hijos que tanto lo necesitan porque dependen de ella.\n\n","en":"Se\u00f1ora \u00c1ngela Isabel L\u00f3pez B. works as the Registry and Certification Assitant at the Manuel Olivares Rodr\u00edguez de Managua Institute.

She is 32 years old. Nelsa Dith is the leader of a 4-member loan group sponsored by GDMPC. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNelsa Dith is single. To make a living, Nelsa Dith sells \"uling\" (charcoal) in the local community. Nelsa Dith has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nelsa Dith joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Nelsa Dith has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Nelsa Dith is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP to buy more charcoal to sell. This will be Nelsa Dith's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Maria Luz has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria Luz joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. She used her previous loan to purchase new equipment and tools to expand her business. Maria Luz is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP to buy more firewood to sell. This will be Maria Luz's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is from the village of Miputak. She is 49 years old. Lilybeth is married and has four children. Some of them are adults and one is a student.  To make a living, Lilybeth operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community. Lilybeth has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 2,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lilybeth joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilybeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase construction materials for a house repair. Lilybeth is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. This fishing activity is managed by her husband. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Lilybeth from PMPC and this is her third time published on Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Winter temperatures can average -20 degrees Celsius. Sixty percent of the city's population live in tents called <i>gers<\/i> with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the ger districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. During the heating season, 60% of the pollution in the city is attributed to coal burned in the ger districts. The bottom fifth quintile spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy-efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius.  60% of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. 60% of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth quintile spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy

Annabelle has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\nIn 2007, Annabelle joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Annabelle is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her sixth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.
