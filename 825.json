They all live in Massala, the main village in the rural commune of Massala, in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative region of Mali).  They know each other because they are relatives or have become such through marriage.  They buy and sell spaghetti, condiments (tomato, paste...), groundnuts, tubers (cassava), as well as \"pagnes\" (colorful West-African fabrics), hand-sewn with wool threads.  In order to pay cash for their purchases, the members of the group have joined Soro Yiriwaso and are on to their second solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMaimouna (standing, first from the left, in the photo) is an important fruit seller in the village.  She is planning to use her loan to buy 40 baskets of tomatoes at the Konodimini fair.  She resells her merchandise for cash or on credit, from her home and at the village fair, to a customer base which mostly consists of women.\r\n\r\nMaimouna hopes that this loan will bring average monthly profits of 45,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the business and also used to buy the condiments that her family needs.  Like the other women of the group, Maimouna's goal is to raise small cattle, through her partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.
