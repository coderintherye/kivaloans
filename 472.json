She has had her business for about 20 years, which she started by selling silver jewelry such as rings and chains, using money that she had saved up.  Esperanza is planning to invest the proceeds of her loan in the purchase of undergarments in dozens, for men, women and children.  She will use her income for new clothing and in such a way will be able to grow her business and achieve her dream of being able to finish building her house.  She also wishes to maintain good health and have a more financially stable life.\r\n\r\nThis member of the Esperanza Group joined us because of the flexible loan payments and better interest rates.  Her background is representative of  the other members of the group and customers of Esperanza, the Haitians (who for the most part have immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) and the Dominicans, both generally live in very poor communities.  This area, like many other areas of limited resources in the Dominican Republic, is lacking in drinking water and constant electrical energy.

Women\u00b4s Bank Of Faith Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Women\u00b4s Bank of Faith is made up of nine women who live in La Rita, Lim\u00f3n, located near the Carribbean coast of Costa Rica. The loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a motivated collection of individuals with the desire and ability to work hard towards the success of the group as well as the overall improvement of living conditions for the members and their families. In general, the main obstacle to the success of these women has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will enable the group members to invest in their businesses and expand operations. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are involved in various productive activities including the rearing and selling of animals (pigs and chickens) as well as commercial and industrial activities. Nuvia, Tania, Yesenia and Lilliana R. have businesses selling clothing in their community. For these women, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of inventory items such as clothing for men, women and children as well as shoes and jewelry. \r\n\r\nLilliana Morin and Doris are in the business of animal rearing. While Lilliana raises chickens and pigs, Doris only handles chickens. For these two loan recipients, this loan will be used to finance investments in livestock, animal feed and construction materials (for the construction of animal pens).\r\nRita is the elected president of this group.  During the week, she takes care of her children and carries out domestic tasks at home. During this time, clients come to peruse various items she has for sale such as clothing, jewelry and shoes. On the weekends, she travels from door to door in her community selling items to clients. Sometimes, her husband goes with her and they travel to neighbouring communities in order to find new clients.\r\n \r\nRita says her main goal is to increase the income generated from her sales business. She says that with more revenue, she will be able to provide a higher standard of living for her family. She would also like to increase the amount of revenue she receives from sales to stores as opposed to individual clients. Rita explained that, like other group members, her main hindrance has been a lack of access to working capital. She says that this loan represents an opportunity to overcome this obstacle. \r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u00b4s Bank of Faith have been neighbours and friends for a number of years. The group acknowledges the advantages of the group lending model: the ability for each group member to act as a loan guarantor as well as recipient. They also acknowledge the potential disadvantage which could manifest itself if any members have trouble making repayments, as each individual is responsible for all repayments.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":612583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"For the purchase of clothing, jewelry, livestock and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"La Rita, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yensy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nuvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1350000,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215808.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":219405.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223062.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":226779.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230559.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234385.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":434.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":449.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":427.62,"local_amount":215808.46,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":216940.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411576,"comment":null},{"amount":434.75,"local_amount":219405.27,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":220556.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551365,"comment":null},{"amount":441.99,"local_amount":223062.02,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":224232.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148786,"comment":null},{"amount":906.21,"local_amount":457350.84,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":459749.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970535,"comment":null},{"amount":464.43,"local_amount":234373.41,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235602.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289980,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T00:19:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":236576,"name":"Maria Estella","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Estella tiene 61 a\u00f1os, es una mujer luchadora y alegre, y a pesar de los constantes problemas que afronta est\u00e1 siempre busca la forma de salir adelante.

She tells us that her most difficult challenge has been raising her daughter by herself without a father by her siD..\r\n\r\nJefrica is very excited about receiving her third loan from Esperanza Internacional after having repaid her previous loans satisfactorily and taken another step towards her business\u2019 growth.\r\n\r\nShe has had her business for about 8 months.  She started it after taking some crafts courses.  She used to sell clothing and cosmetics but after taking the courses she recognized a better opportunity in developing this business.\r\n\r\nJefrica is planning to invest her new loan buying materials to make crafts.  Her plan is to buy plaster, paint and clay plates that she plans to decorate with various motifs.  She will use her profits to save up so that she can rent a locale shortly for her business and be able to display and sell her works. Her dream is to have her own place for her business and she plans to reach it through effort and by getting more loans.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started with us because she needed to develop a business that allowed her to care for daughter and still earn income.  Her story is being used to exemplify her fellow group members as well as all Esperanza\u2019s clients both the Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) as well as the Dominicans who for the most part live in very poor areas, like this zone, and many others in the Dominican Republic that are poor in resources; they lack drinking water and reliable electric service.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in an area of poor resources called Puerto Plata, a city whose economy depends on real estate and tourism although the latter has been overshadowed recently by the emergence of newer tourist areas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":612587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":" To buy paint,

[Enma] is 51 years old and it\u2019s been many years since her loving husband passed away.  Since then she\u2019s had to take charge of the expenses for her three children, who are now adults but still live with her.  The oldest is now establishing his career.  He studied medicine and the other two are students in university.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that this was a difficult task, but this is how she came to begin selling Avon products (perfumes and cosmetics); work that increased over the years.  She works daily from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and sells on credit, collecting from her customers weekly or biweekly.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to fix the floor in her home.  It is a wooden floor that is a bit deteriorated and has caused her some problems.  She wants to replace it and improve her humble home.  She hopes that her will children achieve their goals and that she is able to finish her home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":612594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Repair the floor in her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-10-10T03:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407614,"comment":null},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":37.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388802,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388803,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388804,"comment":null},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":75.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683017,"comment":null},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":75.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422141,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840923,"comment":null},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":73.3,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":74.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-10T18:29:30Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":236582,"name":"Juana Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana del Carmen tiene 51 a\u00f1os, su actividad es la venta de mercader\u00eda en general hace mas de 13 a\u00f1os que tiene este negocio, inicio para mejorar los ingresos de su vivienda, tiene una amplia variedad de clientes que llegan a solicitarle diferentes productos, por lo que ha sabido salir adelante.

P. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Pateno, Brgy. Bocana, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns a living by working with her husband to sell fish. They have two children who are 2 and 7 years old. Daisy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has succeeded in lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She now earns a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, and has applied for a new loan, her tenth, for PHP 15,000, to buy more fish to sell to her customers. Her long-term goal is to save enough money to buy a motorcycle. Daisy P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Kabac, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: pig fattening, buying and selling of charcoal, and buying and selling of beverages, rice, and eggs.  Her husband Pedro D., who is 51 years old, works as a Seaman to earn his living. They have three children whose ages range from 20 to 29 years old. \r\n\r\nAnnie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future by putting up a new business.  Annie is hoping to get into the fishing business, for which she needs to purchase fishing materials and a pump boat. Annie D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a ready-to-wear clothes business. Her husband, Cristobal B., who is 32 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are 6 to 10 years old. \r\n\r\nCrisanta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her 1st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Crisanta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $75, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 2nd cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP which she intends to use as additional capital for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve their living conditions and educate her children. Crisanta B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

 M. is a 53-year old married woman who supports her family by abaca weaving and running a sari-sari (general) store. She lives in Purok 2, Mantija 2, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP8,000. Lilia  is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase weaving materials and stock for her store. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lilia  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Masaba, Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.

Mainggit, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fish vending  business. Her husband, Dionisio Q., who is 38 years old, works as a grinder to earn his living. They have 9 children who are 5 months to 17 years old. Two of their children are already working to help the family, while the other 5 children are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nAnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future and her children's education. Anita Q. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loan to make her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000.\r\n\r\nLecenia is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lecenia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

G. is a widow  who lives in Purok 3, Talavera, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a Ready-to-Wear business.  She has three children who are 24 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nRodelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rodelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future. \r\n\r\nRodelia G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A. is a married woman who lives in Purok Gomez, Brgy. 3, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Lumberyard and \"Resawhan\" businesses. Her husband Enriqueto A., who is 50 years old, works as a foreman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 12 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nDolores joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Dolores has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business (Timber and Lumber) so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and add to their family savings. \r\n\r\nDolores A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Sitio Kalubihan, Barangay Don Pedro, Bogo, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $283. \r\n\r\nVirgilia is now borrowing 18,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Virgilia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

make a living, Cherryl P. produces rice to sell. She is 33 years old, married and has two school-aged children. She is from the village of Bagacay, Sibutad. Cherryl has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,800 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\n\nIn 2010, Cherryl joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Cherryl has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for her business. Cherryl is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to redeem her pawned rice field. This will be her second loan from PMPC. \n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":611528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

C. is a married woman who lives in Campo, Brgy. Inauawan, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling food, running  a general store and raising pigs. Her husband Danilo, who is 48 years old, works as a delivery truck driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children between seven and 23. \r\n\r\nAdamia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adamia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use for the maintenance of her general store and as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and their daily needs. Adamia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for her business, and is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP to be used for its expansion.

It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. is a married woman who lives in Hda. Bungyod, Brgy. Matab-ang, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store and a ready-to-wear clothes business. Her husband Jimmy, who is 54 years old, works as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children between nine and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAngelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus raising the family's standard of living.  For her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Angelita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

P. is a married woman who lives in Masulog, Brgy. Basak, Lapu Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a restaurant and a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (general store). Her husband, Florencio P. Jr, who is 45 years old, helps his wife run the businesses. They have two children who are 12 and 18 years old and both are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nImelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 4,800 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for future house repair, her children's education and for the business. Imelda P. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have four children who are 2 to 7 years old. \r\n\r\nRitchel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she wanted something better for her family.

Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP which she intends to use for the maintenance of her pump boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

They have 2 children who are 1 and 7 years old.\r\n\r\nJean joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jean has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to for the maintenance of her fishing equipment so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children and for home repairs.  Jean L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

At the age of 21, she got married and moved to her husband\u2019s place.\r\n \r\nIn 1993, in order to find better life for their children, Zuura and her husband moved to the Kara-Dobo village in Kyrgyzstan. They began to engage in cattle breeding and managed to multiply their cattle to two cows and two calves.

L\u00ea D. (20209010010) is a 35-year-old male living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh province.  He is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, S. owns and operates an agricultural business raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising chickens for sale.  S. has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3.800.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, S. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  S. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.  S. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  S. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.

V\u0169 Th\u1ecb (20209010011) is a 35-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H. owns & operates a business selling rice products in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3,200,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her borrower's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

To making a living, T. owns and operates a business venture selling rice products in the local community.  Engaged in this business for over 12 years, she earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having repaid her previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  This will be T.'s fourth loan from SEDA, and she  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her enterprise.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:<p>\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

Concepcion is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nConcepcion works in the art sector, particularly in nipa (native roof) weaving. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2006 Concepcion joined PMPC to gain access to its financial services. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from PMPC that was used for personal purposes. Concepcion is requesting a new loan, her fourth from PMPC, of 7000 PHP that will be used for house repairs. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He also dreams that one day he may get to expand his business and perhaps own a supermarket.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":991.99,"image":{"id":612381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To add more stock to the business and to repair his place of work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Maweni;Malindi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-10-06T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.01,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177439563,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":6667.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6734,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578864,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":6666.01,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6732.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188714100,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191452498,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":6666.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6733.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195874619,"comment":null},{"amount":34.65,"local_amount":2771.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2799.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201315712,"comment":null},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6817.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206184955,"comment":null},{"amount":5,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-18T07:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":404,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211698393,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-17T08:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216787946,"comment":null},{"amount":259.64,"local_amount":21411.7,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":21625.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.01,"payment_id":232837659,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":13333.3,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":13466.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238839120,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T21:15:34Z","paid_date":"2011-11-16T09:19:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":236671,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen M. is a married woman who lives in Tapon, Barangay Sillon, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: dried fish, a general store and fish vending. Her husband, Ramon M., who is 63 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are 23 to 39 years old. \r\n\r\nCarmen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 which she intends to use to purchase additional stock so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education and for her family's needs. Carmen M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and an electronic load business. Remedios joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to buy more stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and home repairs. \r\n\r\nRemedios M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb (20209010013) is a 34-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H. owns & operates a business raising chickens for sale.  H. has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 3,600,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. H. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

L\u00ea D. (20209010009) is a 51-year-old man living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. He is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, D\u1ecb owns & operates a business raising cattle for sale.  D\u1ecb has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,300,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, D\u1ecb joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  D\u1ecb has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  D\u1ecb is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock.  The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by D\u1ecb from SEDA.  D\u1ecb plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nD\u1ecb L\u00ea D.

V. is a 61-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a business venture, buying and selling peanuts (salted and Sugar coated).  She lives in Vista Alegre , Tap-ok, Brgy. Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1992 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard buying and selling peanuts (salted and Sugar coated), she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. \r\n\r\nCharles is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she could  purchase a transport vehicle . This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Charles aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

E. is a 38-year-old mother of three children. The eldest, 16, is a college student and the two youngest, 9 and 11, are elementary grade pupils. The family\u2019s main source of income is the salary of her husband, but the cost of living in the city is so expensive that she decided to help her husband with their financial needs. She looked for people to help her financially and she found Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a partner of Kiva in the Philippines. She was encouraged to join because of the principles and program that the institution offers. She consulted her husband about her plan, he approved, and she became a member in 2004. She used her previous loans to start a small store business. Her husband is grateful because his wife now helps to support the family. Sheridan is happy as well because, as years passed, her customers have increased and she is earning more. Now she is applying for another loan of PHP 23000 to buy more grocery products. She wants to buy more sacks of rice for retail, soft drinks, liquors, canned goods, assorted snack foods and noodles, kitchen ingredients and personal beauty products. She will be delighted if Kiva lenders will assist her financially. She is hoping that the partnership of ASHI and Kiva will continue and prosper."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":612832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have three children who are 3 to 8 years old. \r\n\r\nVelenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for home repairs. \r\n\r\nVelenda E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

San Antonio, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Cane Planter (Arendo) businesses. Her husband Eriberto Miguil Jr., who is 33 years old, works as a Tricycle (three-wheeled transport vehicle) Driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 3 and  9 years old. \r\n\r\nAilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ailyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use to pay for inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nAilyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

L. is a married woman who lives in Sitio Toril, Bocana, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a small pharmacy and a Nipa business. Her husband Gilbert, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 24 and 26 years old. \r\n\r\nAnnabel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for her family's future and for improvements in their house. \r\n\r\nAnnabel L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Her previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, raising her family's standard of living.  This time, for her tenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future of her family and business. \r\n\r\nEditha S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

E. is a married woman who lives in Pandan, Brgy. Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by fishing and selling ready-to-wear clothes. Her husband, Camelo E., age 42, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have three children who are 11 to 17 years old. \n\nPatricia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Patricia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,800 PHP, thus improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase a pedicab so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education and her business. Patricia E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Mahigugma-on, Barangay Patic, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  wholesale shrimp sales and delivery of salt. Her husband, Roderick, 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children, 9 months and 3 years old. Jelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase equipment for her delivery business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her business. Jelyn U. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Mahigugma-on, Barangay Patic, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and rice retail. Her husband Rolando, who is 42 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children, 4 months and 2 years old. \r\n\r\nAnalyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy more inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements. Analyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: vegetable sales and fish vending. Her husband Rolly, 47 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children, 9 to 15 years old. Bebilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bebilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy more stock of vegetables and fertilizer so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Bebilyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF  :In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Prk. Sunflower, Barangay Calumangan, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and buying and selling of rice, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Letecia is now borrowing PHP 16,000 so that she  can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Letecia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Milagrosa, Barangay 1-A, Manapla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: dried fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband Segundo, 43 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 6 to 14 years old. Emeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy more piglets so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Emeline A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a married woman who lives in Purok RD, Barangay Su-ay, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a vehicle spare parts business. Her husband Ruben S., 42 years old, works as a conductor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children who are between the ages of 5 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nJudilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon,  Judilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use to buy more stocks for her vehicle spare parts business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and to make repairs to her home. Judilyn S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a married woman who lives in Passing trak, Barangay Marine, Cadiz City, Negros Occcidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a business of food vending. Her husband Edson, 43 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children who are between the ages of 12 to 22 years old. \r\n\r\nBethel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bethel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy more kitchen utensils for her food vending business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Bethel S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Gilda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Argawanon, San Remegio, Cebu. She earns her living with a handicraft business. Her husband, Max Arthur D., age 26, works as a construction worker to earn his living. They have four children who are 1 month to 6 years old. \r\n\r\nMaguinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Maguinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 14,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. Maguinda D. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Keyla has a business selling various stationary items including ink cartridges, blank CD\u00b4s, DVD\u00b4s, and other computer hardware\/software\/office supplies. Additionally, she offers cell phone top-up and photocopying services. Keyla plans to use this loan to invest in ink cartridges in order to fill her store with more inventory items in an effort to attract more customers. \r\n\r\nBeing a single mother and business owner, Keyla must be organized. Her days are jam packed, as she operates within the constraints of a tight schedule. Keyla wakes up at 5:30 AM in order to prepare breakfast for her children, get them ready for school, and carry out domestic tasks. She brings her children to school around 7:00 AM, then between 7 and 8 Keyla does her exercises in order to be able to open the store by 8:30 AM. At mid day, she closes her store to eat lunch; she re-opens the store at 1:30 PM and works until 6:00 PM. At this time, she helps her children with their school work and prepares dinner. She usually goes to bed by 9:30 PM.\r\n\r\nIn terms of goals and aspirations, Keyla has many. The idea is to expand her business and increase income so that she can continue to provide quality food, shelter and education for her children. Her ambition is for her business to become an established corporation in her community, offering various services to meet the needs of a diverse range of clients. Her major motivation is the sustenance of her family, and to provide a  positive example for her children. The values she wishes to instill are those of ambition, hard work, strength and a fighting spirit. It is of special importance, a source of pride to Keyla, to be able to support a dignified home and living conditions. \r\n\r\nKeyla has mentioned the importance of having a good credit history.  Like many micro-entrepreneurs, Keyla has found it difficult to secure a source of financing for working capital. She says that in order to surmount this challenge, it is important to project a positive image (as you can see in the picture). She says that once you are approved for credit, you must be punctual with repayments and responsible with the credit allowed you. She says a good credit history can opens doors and speaks to the general caliber of an individual\u00b4s nature.

R. is a 36-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: fishing, fish vending and pig fattening.\r\n\r\nShe lives in Pandan, Brgy. Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing, fish-vending and pig-fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 24,000 Philippines pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nMarlyn is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and other equipment. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nMarlyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the NWTF lending-team page on Kiva to join our team:

These bundles (called \u201cpacas\") are a good opportunity for her informal business.  There is a great demand in her country.  She will use the earnings to save and to share the family expenses with her life partner.  With future loans she will improve her business.  She will also be able to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe group's association with Esperanza started because Paula saw the opportunity for growth that this program offers.  Also, at the time she needed more money to increase her sales.  Her story is being used to represent the other members of the group and Esperanza\u2019s clients.  There are as many Haitian clients (most of whom have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them are new clients) as Dominican.  The Dominicans generally live in very poor communities.  This area, like many other areas with scant resources in the Dominican Republic, lacks potable water and continual electricity.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in an area that is bordered by sugar cane fields in San Pedro de Macoris.

Su historia est\u00e1 siendo usada para representar a los dem\u00e1s miembros de su grupo y a los clientes de Esperanza, tanto los haitianos (quienes en su mayor\u00eda ha emigrado hacia la Republica Dominicana desde Hait\u00ed, algunos de ellos recientemente) y los dominicanos, quienes por lo general viven en comunidades muy pobres, esta zona, como muchas otras zonas de escasos recursos en la Republica Dominicana, carecen de agua potable y energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica constante. Este grupo se encuentra ubicado en una zona bordeada de campos de ca\u00f1a en San Pedro de Macoris, una ciudad famosa por sus jugadores de pelota y por la industria azucarera, su econom\u00eda actual depende de la Zona franca, la industria D. cemento y otras actividades menores como el turismo.\n\nLa persona en el circulo, no pertenece al grupo, es el acompa\u00f1ante de uno de los miembros.","en":"Santos (or Estela, as she is known to everyone) is a member of the group Hope and Striving 3 & 4. The members sell clothes, cosmetics, shoes, food, etc. Her family is made up of her, her husband, and their 4 children, who she enjoys hugely. She also loves to go to the church and sing. Her main challenge at the moment is to build an apartment to rent out and generate income for the family.\r\nSantos is very excited to receive her 7th loan from Esperanza Internacional after having successfully repaid her previous loans and having taken the first steps in growing her business. She has had her business for about 6 years, and she started it with her first loan. Santos plans to use the new loan to buy food (rice, beans, oil, sugar, etc) for her small grocery store, a business that depends on selling all sorts of food and other products. It is a little community store. She is going to use the income to continue investing in her business. \r\nShe started this association with us because she needed to invest in her business. Her story is being used to represent the rest of the members of this group who are clients of Esperanzo, who are a mix of Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) and Dominicans, who for the most part live in very poor communities. This area, in common with many other resource poor areas of the Dominican Republic, lacks potable water and a reliable electricity supply. This group can be found in an area at the edge of the sugar cane fields of San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for its baseball players and for the sugar industry. Its present day economy depends on the free trade zone, the cement industry, and other more minor activities like tourism. \r\nThe person circled in the picture is not a member of the group - this is someone who was accompanying one of the group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":613055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

This group is located in the Samana Peninsula, a developing tourist destination, bordered by the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and rich in natural resources.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is very excited to receive his third loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having paid off his previous loans satisfactorily and having taken a step in his business' growth.  He has had his business for almost two years, and he started it by buying a pig to sell roasted at a stand on the side of the main highway.  He is planning to invest his new loan in the purchase of different types of meat.  His business is a butcher shop, and he plans to use his earnings to improve his home, which he hopes to build soon.  His dream is to improve his family's quality of life and offer them greater stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":613186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To

They are her motivation to succeed. Many years ago she worked for a textile company, and at the time, had learned everything there was to know about that profession. That is why she decided to start her own business which makes and sells handbags. She  now works at a market in the area of quality control, and while there sells bags and purses to her friends and coworkers. What she likes most about her business is that it generates good income without taking up too much time, which allows her to help educate her children. She has been doing business enthusiastically for five years, and her husband has been simultaneously supporting her with work by getting her the necessary materials that she needs.

A. is a cattle farmer, 34 years old, and together with his wife and their three children he lives in the community of Las Minas, Dulce Nombre de Culmi in Olancho. Felipe has been a cattle farmer since he was a boy, having learned the trade from his father. Felipe raises milking cows and he has his own establishment from where he makes his sales, he also makes other products such as cheese and butter. One of the difficulties he faces is the rainy season when the milk production in the region increases and the price of the products drops for the abundance and this decreases his earnings. But to his advantage is that he is able to sell some of his livestock for meat. The loan he requests is to purchase calves to increase his herd of milk cows and improve his earnings, to still be able to support his family and his kids that are in school. This is his first loan cycle with FAMA (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to the payment terms."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":613251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Catacamas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-10-13T12:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipe Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.59,"local_amount":3341.3,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-06T10:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3393.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534729,"comment":null},{"amount":89.22,"local_amount":1659.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1685.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414812,"comment":null},{"amount":89.52,"local_amount":1665.47,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1691.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833432,"comment":null},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275977,"comment":null},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206143294,"comment":null},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216238,"comment":null},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494619,"comment":null},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307924,"comment":null},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784905,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T22:16:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":236894,"name":"Chea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"There are four borrowers who are taking this loan together.

is Emma S., 48. She is a resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Cancio S., a driver, and the mother of four children, one of whom is already working, while two are in high school. The youngest is currently enrolled in elementary school. By the grace of God, Emma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college - a dream for most Filipino parents like Emma as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEmma maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange and others. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nEmma dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes that she will be able to recruit many more women like her to her business. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members* to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":615173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

She is married to Rodrigo F., a jeepney driver, and mother to four children. By the grace of God, Mary Ann has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send all of them all the way through college.\r\n\r\nMary Ann oversees operations of their jeepney** transportation business. They have both long (20-22 person capacity) and short (14-16 person capacity) jeepneys, all of which are meeting their daily capacity quota. Mary Ann\u2019s husband also drives one of the jeepneys. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php30, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy eight new tires for the jeepneys. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMary Ann dreams to be able to buy another jeepney soon. She also dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n**Jeepneys have purely American origins.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been struggling with ill-health and poverty because of natural disasters. Her most difficult challenges have been raising capital for her business, paying for her children\u2019s education and building a house of her own. She plans to invest this loan in agricultural products so that she can raise cash crops and produce such as cassava, corn and yams. Cassava will be her main crop because people in her area use it to make many foods. She also plans to start a general store as a way to generate income for her family. She believes these efforts will succeed because she has been in these lines of work for a long time and was born into a farming family. She also believes that she is good at customer relations, and this will increase her chances of succeeding. This loan will also help her community because it means that people will be more likely to afford three meals per day at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nElizabeth will use her profits to expand her business, take care of her family, pay her rent and send her children to school. She likes working with GHAPE because of the training she receives and the low cost of receiving and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She married but is separated from her husband due to some difficulties. They are blessed with  five children and live in  Ntamulung, a district in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nFlorence has faced some challenges in life.  She has been struggling with ill  health and the problem of poor  yield due to natural disasters. The most difficult problem has been raising capital for her business and  paying for her children\u2019s education and building a house of her own.  She plans to invest this loan in agricultural products, namely in the production  of cash crops and other farm produce such as, cassava, corn, and cocoyams. \r\n\r\nShe is most  especially interested in cassava which is used in the production of gari and water-fufu (staple dishes). She also plans to invest part in her general provisions store which will raise daily income for her family. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and that she born a farmer and now she has become an expert in farming over the past years. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least three meals per day at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nFlorence will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent and save for a rainy day. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost of obtaining and ease of paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She has combined her educational background and her entrepreneurial instincts to open a beauty salon. Merida offers hair services such as styling, cutting, coloring and other hair related services, as well as nail services (manicures, pedicures etc.)  She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of various beauty products\/tools such as hair dryers, a hair straightener, scissors, creams, shampoos, nail polish, etc. Merida started her business five years ago with a loan she shared with a friend. This loan will be her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nOver the past year, Merida has been focused on raising her newborn son. As a result, she has been working half time at her salon. This loan will mark the return to full time work for Merida, as she aims to transform this loan into profits. Full time business hours are from 9:00AM to 6:00PM, Monday to Saturday, and Merida works alone.  The months of October, November and December are the busiest in the beauty industry. Merida can count on anywhere between 60 to 100 regular clients who make monthly visits during this time. Merida\u00b4s services are sought not only by members of her immediate community, but by clients in neighbourung communities who travel to visit her salon (San Jose, San Carlos, Guanacaste). These clients have helped to keep her business flourishing as there are a number of beauty salons in the area, creating high levels of competition for clients.\r\n\r\n In an effort to differentiate her salon from those of her competitors, Merida would like to invest in an automatic nail painter. This machine paints nails quickly and with intricate designs. The machine is quite expensive, so Merida will not be putting the current loan towards such a machine, possibly the next loan.\r\n\r\nIn general, Merida wakes up early, prepares breakfast for her husband and son, and carries out domestic tasks. From 9:00AMto 6:00PM she will be working in the salon, with an hour lunch break.
