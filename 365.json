The oldest is married and recently moved away.  The 3 younger children still live with her.  Her house is in the south part of Lima.\r\n\r\nMartha used to have a clothing store in a commercial zone of her neighborhood but it wasn't viable because she couldn't cover the store's monthly rent.  She subsequently decided to move the business to her house and sell from there.  Whenever she has the chance now, she loads up her clothing bag and calls on friends and acquaintances to buy whatever she has on offer.  This approach has worked much better and it's work that she very much likes doing.  With her husband's income from his construction work, they are able to provide the things their children need.  Martha is considering buying display cases so that she can better show her merchandise at home.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fifth MPF loan.  She has promised to go on being responsible about repaying her loans because she wants to ensure that she can get new loans in the future.  At the same time, she is happy to be part of her group and she has no complaints about any of the other members.  She will use the loan to buy uniforms that she can sell during the coming school year and, in turn, increase her income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":501949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy merchandise to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-06T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":286},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":284}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.68,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993349,"comment":null},{"amount":103.67,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718131,"comment":null},{"amount":103.68,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":295.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751807,"comment":null},{"amount":103.67,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934268,"comment":null},{"amount":103.68,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673041,"comment":null},{"amount":103.67,"local_amount":286,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886854,"comment":null},{"amount":102.95,"local_amount":284,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":293.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153860,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-08T20:34:22Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183037,"name":"Nelva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelva es una mujer emprendedora de 44 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y es madre de dos hijos mayores y profesionales.

El empe\u00f1o que puso en este negocio conjunto con su t\u00eda hicieron que creciera de a poquito, no fue sencillo lograrlo porque en este negocio la mercader\u00eda se renueva cada cierto tiempo hablamos de cada cuatro meses por lo menos o dependiendo la tendencia de la moda o el gusto de la clientela. Los pr\u00e9stamos que recibi\u00f3 le ayudaron para invertir en zapatos y accesorios que le faltaba. Con este trabajo Amalia apoya a su pareja en lo gatos de su familia, la responsabilidad que tienen ambos de criar y educar a sus tres hijos de 14, 13 y 11 a\u00f1os de edad, quienes a\u00fan estudian en el colegio.\nEn la actualidad su mercader\u00eda asciende a doscientos cincuenta entre prendas de caballeros, damas y ni\u00f1as y 40 pares de zapatos. Se acerca la \u00e9poca escolar en donde Amalia necesita matricular, comprarle el uniforme y \u00fatiles escolares a sus hijos y a veces no es suficiente el dinero, por ello Amalia necesita del pr\u00e9stamo en esta oportunidad para comprarles los \u00fatiles escolares con la mitad del pr\u00e9stamo y la diferencia en algunos vestidos cortos de acuerdo a la estaci\u00f3n que estamos (verano).\n\nRebeca tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 inmersa en el negocio de prendas en alquiler hace a\u00f1o y medio a sus treinta y dos a\u00f1os es madre soltera de una hija de siete a\u00f1os, fue este el motivo que decidi\u00f3 trabajar as\u00ed, primero empez\u00f3 a vender comida en un puesto cerca de un mercado solo estuvo un a\u00f1o as\u00ed, lo tuvo que cerrar porque los ingresos que generaba no cubr\u00eda con sus necesidades. \nEl actual negocio de alquiler de ropa le resulta mejor, claro que en ocasiones tuvo algunos altibajos pero el trato que brinda Rebeca a sus clientes la ayudado en conservar su negocio, lo mejor\u00f3 y progres\u00f3 no pen\u00f3 alcanzar a tener trescientos vestidos y ciento cuarenta zapatos adem\u00e1s carteras lo que en un inicio ten\u00eda veinte vestidos y 15 zapatos lo hizo con la ganancias que obten\u00eda y pr\u00e9stamo que obtuvo.

During that time they have demonstrated responsibility and teamwork.  Even though they each have different objectives, they are characterized as being tenacious people.  We take this opportunity to get to know Amalia and Rebeca.\r\n\r\nAmalia works helping her aunt in her business of renting clothes for social events like weddings, celebrating 15th birthdays, and promotions for schools, institutes and universities.  She has done this for four years.  During that time the business has changed a lot.  In the beginning their merchandise consisted of 25 dresses and 30 suits.  That was all they had.  The effort that she put into this business, along with her aunt\u2019s effort, made the business grow a bit.  It was not easy to do because in this business the merchandise is updated every so often.  We are talking about at least four months, depending on the style or the customer\u2019s preferences.  The loans that she received helped her to invest in the shoes and accessories that she needed.  With this work Amalia helps her life partner with the family expenses.  It is the responsibility that they both have to raise and educate their three children.   The children are 14, 13, and 11.  They go to school.  Currently, her merchandise has risen to 250 outfits for men, women, and children and 40 pairs of shoes.  School season is approaching, and Amalia needs to register her children and buy them school uniforms and school supplies.  At times she does not have enough money.  That is why she now needs the loan to buy school supplies with half of the loan.  She will use the rest of the money to buy short dresses that correspond to the season we are in (summer).\r\n\r\nRebeca has also been involved in the business of renting outfits.  She has done this for one and a half years.  She is 32 years old, and she is the single mother of a seven year old daughter.  This was her motivation for deciding to work this way.  First she started selling food in a stand close to a market.  She only did that for a year.  She had to close because the income generated did not cover their necessities.  Her current business of renting clothes is better for her.  Of course, she has had some ups and downs, but the service Rebeca gives her customers has helped her keep her business.  She improved and developed it until she had 300 outfits, 140 pairs of shoes, and purses.  When she started she had 20 outfits and 15 pairs of shoes.  She did it with the earnings she obtained and the loan she got.  She will keep investing in merchandise in order to rent another stand.  Rebeca\u2019s objective is to give her little girl the best.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":502243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy short dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.943056 -76.709444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-08T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Leonidas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Larissa Marisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azucena Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodolfo Eusebio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Iris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crumaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edi Amalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8500,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":3400,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661424,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694084,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877048,"comment":null},{"amount":600,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-02T17:17:07Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183084,"name":"Ratna Sari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Putu A.

When asked why she married a driver, she said that he is a sweet lover and a father to their three children whose ages are from three months old to three years old. Her husband and children give her reason to live happily, despite being poor. They are her inspiration to aim for a better kind of life someday by growing her own business and being more productive.\r\n \r\nIn 2008, Rosita has able to achieve her goal of putting up her own \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store business. This was made possible through a loan she received through ASHI after she became a member. Unfortunately, it did not prosper after a year because it had accumulated a huge amount of receivables from her customers who live in the neighborhood. Worst was the fact they they are also very poor economically. Thus, Rosita has nothing to do for them to pay back.\r\n\r\nThough Rosita had struggled from losing her business while still paying for her loan and supporting the needs of her family, still she was able to cope because of the support of her husband. Now, she is requesting another loan from Kiva through ASHI because she and her husband will be starting a new business which is selling fish.

year-old Lolita T. feels sad that her previous business, her \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, failed. Although, it was just small, its income was the only source of income to support her daily needs, as well as of some of her children's and grand-children's needs. She is already a widow and all of her three children have their own families now. Because her children are poor, in economic terms, Lolita as a mother couldn\u2019t do anything but support them in her own little way. Unforntanely, while busying herself supporting them she lost control of her business. Despite that failure, she still feels happy that her business has helped her children and their families. Moreover, she was able to pay back the whole loan she received from ASHI for that business and now she is able to request another loan to begin a new business, which is hog\/pig fattening.\r\n\r\nFor Lolita, hog fattening is sort of like saving money in a pig. Indeed after four months of fattening, the pig will be sold (either slaughtered or alive) and by then her capital will have produced a small profit. Once she raises more pigs and sells more, her profits will be doubled along with her capital.

However, despite her frustrations, she still feels happy because she has been able to support the education of her three children in college with the help of her business profits, though only one has graduated. \r\n\r\nNow, Porcesa is requesting a loan from Kiva through ASHI to support the necessary expenses of her rice farming business, which is managed by her husband.

On the other hand, she still feels happy that her son has taken the responsibility of helping them run their fishing business instead of rebelling against their poor life status. With that, her business eventually grew a bit, and she was able to support her second child\u2019s education in college.

a 50-year-old man living in Aley, Mount Lebanon with his wife and their four children, has owned a shoe shop for eight years. He decided on opening his shop because of his extensive experience in sales, which led to a great deal of networking.  When he first started his work, he had some difficulties making himself known to the public because he didn\u2019t have a budget for advertising, having to content himself with word of mouth; as well, early on he  didn\u2019t have enough cash to purchase all the needed merchandise for his shop.

He is 40 years old, married, and is the father of a five-year-old son who does not yet attend school. Sumail only studied through 7th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nSumail left Cabo Delgado for the district of Boane in search of better living conditions. He has had his own business for more than 4 years and has no other employees, though he is helped by his wife. He sells wooden beds and nightstands, and his monthly earnings come to around 7000.00 Meticales. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some money each month in his bank account (with Millenium Bim). \r\n\r\nSumail has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through neighbors who were already working with the institution. This is his 3rd loan, for the amount of 20,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy products (wooden beds, nightstands and other items) in order to increase his merchandise. His earlier loans were for 6000.00 Meticales and 11,500.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to begin selling mattresses in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is 29 years old and is the mother of 2 children who are 12 and 8 years old. Both children attend school. Fatima studied through 12th grade and then stopped because of a lack of funds, but she plans to pursue more advanced studies. She lives in her own home with her family and she also cares for her mother, who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Maputo for Boane in search of work and better living conditions. She has had her own business for more than 5 years and has one employee who helps her with her work. On top of this, for the past year she has also been working in a company that produces photographic film (Fuji). In this job she earns a monthly salary of  3000.00 Meticales and her business earnings come to around 4000.00 Meticales a month. She uses this income to cover household expenses and she also saves around 500.00 Meticales a month in her bank account. \r\n\r\nFatima has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through people close to her who have worked with the institution for a long time. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy products (brooms, rakes, cleaning products and other items) in order to expand and strengthen her business. Her earlier loan was for 150,000.00 Meticales and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans in order to construct a satisfactory building for her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":502512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of brooms, mops and rakes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-09T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima Issufo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":661.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":691.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":723.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":755.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":789.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":825.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":863.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":902.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":942.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":985.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1029.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1076.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1125.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1176.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1229.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1221.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":2044.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T07:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2084.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972149,"comment":null},{"amount":66.95,"local_amount":2114.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2155.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698706,"comment":null},{"amount":68.43,"local_amount":2160.92,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-31T08:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2202.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916183,"comment":null},{"amount":274.87,"local_amount":8680.11,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":8848.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878599,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-09T08:09:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183183,"name":"Linet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linet is a 44-year-old married woman living in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale.

He is 51 years old, married, and has 6 children who are 29, 24, 22, 18, 16 and 13 years old. Five of his children attend school, only the oldest one does not. Cesar only studied through 4th grade, and didn't continue because a lack of financial resources. He lives in her own home with his family and helps to support his mother financially by sending her money to cover her household expenses.\r\n\r\nCesar left Gaza for the city of Maputo with his family due to the instability caused by the Mozambican Civil War. He set up residency there and later began his work in sales. He has owned his business for more than 12 years and has no other employees, though his children help him. He makes around 1500-2000 Meticales a day, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some money in his bank account at the end of the month.\r\n\r\nCesar had taken out loans before with the SOCREMO credit cooperative, but he decided not to continue for various reasons. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who was already working with the institution. This is his 4th loan, for the amount of 22,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy merchandise (rice, sugar, flour, cooking oil and other items) in order to expand and diversify the products he sells. His earlier loans were for 12,400.00, 13,000.00 and 18,000.00 Meticales and were all used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for more loans to put towards expanding his business and exploring other areas of sales.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is 34 years old, and the single mother of a 14-year old, who attends school.  Ana attended school until the 7th grade and dropped out due to a lack of financial resources. She lives with her child in a home she owns, and does not support anyone else.  \r\n\r\nShe left Xai-xai for Maputo with her parents when she was very young.  She now lives in Matola in the neighborhood of Malhampshene.  She has had her own business for more than 5 years.  She does not have any employees; she only has help from her daughter occasionally.  She sells a variety of new clothing, and earns around 8.000,00 MT to 10.000.00 Mt per month, which she uses primarily to add-on to her home and she also has some savings in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has had loans in the past through NOVO BANCO and PROCREDIT, but she decided not to continue with them for various reasons.

He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, sand, paint and other items) in order to finish his construction project.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

is a 57-year-old married man living in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale. He has ten children, ranging in age from 11 to 27 years old, with seven of them currently attending school.\r\n\r\nSammy has been running his mixed farm for over 15 years now, and sells milk and vegetables to retailers in his town. He also owns a vegetable kiosk where he sells his own produce. He says that lately the main challenge to his business is the droughts that have been difficult for his farming activities, along with financial constraints limiting the amount of farm inputs he can purchase.\r\n\r\nSammy has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, recently completing one loan cycle.

She is 48 years old, and a widow and mother of three children, 20, 18, and 13 years of age. All of her children attend school. She only went through the 4th grade, and wasn't able to continue because of her family's difficult financial circumstances. She lives in her own house with her children, and isn't financially responsible for anyone else. She left Maputo for the city of Matola when her husband died more than four years ago. She has her own business, which she started after losing her husband. She doesn't have any employees, and she sells chickens, eggs, corn and meat. In addition, she also receives a monthly pension from the Industrial da Matola company, where her husband works. The pension is 1600 meticals, and she makes 4500 meticals a month from her business. She uses her income to cover household expenses, and is able to set a little aside in a savings account. She's never received loans from other banks, and learned about Hvuluku through friends. This is her first loan, in the amount of 16,000 meticals, which she intends to use to purchase materials (eggs, meat, corn, chickens, etc.) to increase her stock. She's committed to paying this loan off on time so that she'll be eligible for others in the future. She'd like to request additional loans to build a grocery store and a chicken coop where she can raise broiler hens as a way to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":502539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase eggs, chickens, etc. for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":661.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":691.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":723.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":755.8},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":789.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":825.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":863.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":902.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":942.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":985.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1029.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1076.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1125.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1176.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1229.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1221.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.03,"local_amount":821.92,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":837.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972157,"comment":null},{"amount":39.74,"local_amount":1254.96,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1279.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732371,"comment":null},{"amount":409.23,"local_amount":12923.12,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13174.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916190,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T17:22:33Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183203,"name":"Sunday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunday is a hardworking man and he lives in Oyo state, Nigeria.

She is 31 years old, married, and is the mother of 2 children who are 10 and 4 years old. The 10 year old attends school. Luisa only studied through 5th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources, but she would like to continue studying in adult literacy classes. She lives in her own home with her family and has helped to support her siblings with school materials and medical care.\r\n\r\nLuisa never left Boane, she only leaves for one or two day shopping trips. She began working in 1987, when she was still very young, because of the difficult life that her family was facing. She now owns her own business, works around 12 hours a day, and doesn't have any other employees. Her husband, who works as a gardener for a company that grows and sells bananas, sometimes helps her with the business. Luisa earns 4500.00 Meticales per month on average. She uses this money to pay for household expenses, and also saves some money at home each month for any additional expenditures that might arise.\r\n\r\nLuisa had taken out loans before with the PROCREDIT credit cooperative, but she decided not to continue for various reasons. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 10,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy products (rice, cooking oil, peanuts, eggs and other items) in order to increase her merchandise.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to apply for more loans to put towards her business activities. Her dream is to build a decent home for her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":502546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of cooking oil, rice and other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-11T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lu\u00edsa Calisto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":447.95},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":468.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":489.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":511.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":534.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":558.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":584.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":610.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":638.03},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":697.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":728.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":761.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":795.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":831.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":675.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.98},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.74},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.87},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":1063.01,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T07:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1112.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972159,"comment":null},{"amount":52.31,"local_amount":1609.47,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1683.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698713,"comment":null},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":1646.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-25T07:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1722.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916192,"comment":null},{"amount":99.52,"local_amount":3062.19,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3203.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878603,"comment":null},{"amount":10.24,"local_amount":315.37,"processed_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":329.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201307551,"comment":null},{"amount":25.87,"local_amount":795.88,"processed_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-28T07:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":832.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206176315,"comment":null},{"amount":27.03,"local_amount":831.86,"processed_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":870.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211249962,"comment":null},{"amount":21.96,"local_amount":675.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":706.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216529351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T18:37:47Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:18:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183208,"name":"Kemi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kemi is very happy with the growth of her business; with her last Kiva loan she bought more bags of flour and other baking items in large quantities.

She reserves the product with a down payment and the balance is given in payments, and in this manner she makes more profit, and in this same way they have begun to request clothing and other products. This is how she decided to open a store in her own home, and then began to travel to Trujillo because they would request good quality shoes. Little by little she gained more clients and her business prospered a lot. Unfortunately, when her daughter became ill she had to leave the business and dedicate herself to her family. After some time she has returned to the business but only in-home sales and it is going well because her clients are OK with that. With her income she has achieved economic stabilty as well as being able to help her husband with the construction of their own home.\r\n\r\nIn the future Yesenia would like to have a restaurant that serves traditional food; she has taken a course to be a chef and would like to serve as one. It is for this reason that she is saving money because she wishes to buy an adequate piece of land where she can build her restaurant. She and 8 partners are members of the group \u201cYHIRET\u201d. She has been with EDAPROSPO for close to 4 years and is happy with the support that she has received from this entity. Now she will use her loan in order to buy clothes and sneakers since she already has orders to fulfill. The school year is a good time for her business and she will take full advantage of this time. \r\n\r\n* Yesenia appears in the photo with a red shirt and blue pants; she is the 6th person seated. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Soraya Alamdari, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":502673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase clothing and sneakers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Yesenia Dorisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Clelia Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anatolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adelina Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Oscar Octavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Segundo Mesias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gloroa Edelmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3400,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":854.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661425,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":854.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694085,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":854.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877049,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":854.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617024,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T00:25:55Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":183277,"name":"Africa Romano 1,3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elida is the coordinator of her group, Africa Romano, and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).\r\n\r\nElida\u2019s group is located in the rural areas surrounding El Seybo, a poor agricultural area where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable.

She has an ability to overcome the difficulties and looks to the world with the hope for a better tomorrow. Aynagul is 46 and married. She has a smart husband who is a member of a farm. They have seven children whom they adore and their children are as determined as their mother is. The older children are unique themselves. They already achieved goals in their life and at present stay separately from her. The younger ones still attend the local school and in their free time, they eagerly help their mother in her business. Baktygul is the middle daughter and she is a schoolgirl. She is eighteen and studies in 10th grade. Next is Rahat who studies in eighth grade and the last one is Aynagul\u2019s joy. He is a six-year-old boy who studies in first grade. When he grows up, he wants to be the President of Kyrgyzstan. So Aynagul and her friendly family deal with livestock. Since 2000, they have been selling cattle and for the money they got, they already have bought a new house, married off their daughter and increased the number of the cattle.
