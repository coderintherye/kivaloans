She remembers that when she started on her own she would only sell a couple of cases and now she stocks a variety of flavors and sizes of drinks.  Her goal now is to keep growing until she is able to have a mini distribution company.  This will be her second loan with MFP and she counts on their collaboration to continue with her objectives.  She also promises to make her payments on time again, as she did with her previous loan.  With the requested 1,000 nuevos soles, she will buy larger quantities of drinks because during the hot season in her area she will make more sales and she wants to be prepared to be able to stock up.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.98,"image":{"id":993706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more cases of drinks\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kathya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":147.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":159.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":177.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.19,"local_amount":147.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":148.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246327,"comment":null},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":159.44,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":160.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T04:29:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386386,"name":"Esi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esi  operates a chop bar (where a variety of African dishes are sold), she has done this for 10 years.

He has moved his family ahead with a business selling party decorations such as pi\u00f1atas and ceramic items, as well as cards and accessories. \r\n\r\nWhen Luis left his job in a granary, he decided to start his own business in order to be able to improve his family\u2019s well-being. Drawing on his wife\u2019s experience with this kind of business, he found a shop, invested in pi\u00f1atas and cards and began selling in a very commercial area. His business has gradually grown and he has specialized in everything pertaining to parties: cards, pi\u00f1atas, mementos in cardboard, styrofoam and especially cold porcelain.\r\n\r\nCurrently his dream of increasing his working capital is growing because his customer base is expanding daily. That is why he came to KIVA for a loan, which he will use to buy ceramic and cardboard items, as well as pi\u00f1atas, in greater volume in order to lower his sales price and increase his working capital. His greatest challenge was when he acquired private loans, which were very onerous and did not allow him to get ahead. But that is in the past and now, with his and his wife\u2019s dedication, work discipline and sense of responsibility, he wants to expand his business in order to increase his children\u2019s well-being so they can grow and have a successful future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":992878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy ceramic and cardboard items, as well as pi\u00f1atas, in greater quantities so that he can lower his sales price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":70804},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79946},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81812},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83721},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85674},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87673},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89719},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91812},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93955},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96147},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98390},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":110347}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T21:23:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384997,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio se sigue dedicando al negocio de ganaderia,el socio los ganados los hace engordar y crecer y luego los vende en las diferentes ferias que existe en el distrito de Anta y tambien el socio sigue siendo alba\u00f1il,el socio pinta y hace refacciones de casas,el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar el negocio de ganaderia.El  socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar alimentos para los ganados y tambien para comprar herramientas como pinturas y yeso.\n El socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n","en":"This member continues in the livestock business.

Together they live in their own home and everyday she works to offer a better quality of life to their children. Sulejka has very good tastes when it comes to clothing. Since she was little, she has liked to make doll dresses and dress her younger siblings. Over time, she realized that sewing was her passion and she decided to install a workshop in her house where she could attend to her customers, make new designs and mend clothing. She has been working in this industry for 5 years and expresses that when she started, she worked for other people and had many difficulties. Her income was minimal and did not help to pay the household expenses. Over time, she decided that it was the right moment to start her own business and she started to work independently. Now, everything is going much better for her now that she has better income and she wishes to continue growing her business. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support, because in this way she will feel more secure in growing her business.

She is married with two children between the ages of 10 and 18 years old. Kadiatu's children are currently attending school. In 1997, Kadiatu established her business. She began her business because timber has no seasonal problem and it is easy to operate. She works at the business from 7:30 am until 8:00 pm, 7 days per week.

She sells domestic appliances such as plasma television sets and sound equipment.  She has between 20 to 50 customers in different areas, including those working in public and private offices.  She takes orders from her customers, which she pays for up front and later collects weekly or monthly, increasing the price depending on the time taken to collect payment.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part of her business is that she asks the customers to choose their product instead of doing what other people do, which is buy the products first then try to sell them.  Her way of doing things ensures the customers are always satisfied since they are the ones who directly choose what they want to buy.  Gregoria is requesting a loan to buy plasma TVs wholesale so she can deliver the orders to her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.05,"image":{"id":993848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Rosario's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 35,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosario dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Having so much experience in this line of work enables him to enjoy a strong reputation and he gets many orders from outside his area, but lacks the necessary resources to be able to satisfy demand. 5 years ago, because of his wish to better satisfy his growing customer base, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n\r\nBaba will use this new loan to buy 25 sacs of millet, 1 ton of corn and 15 sacs of fonio (the smallest of the millet species). He gets his supplies in the villages of Finkolo Ganadougou, Farakala and Lobougoula, neighbouring communities in the Sikasso region. He stores the cereals he buys in his warehouse and sells his merchandise, either wholesale or retail, to resellers and consumers.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Baba anticipates earning a monthly profit of 100 000 francs. He plans to use those profits to cover his essential expenditure and pay his household expenses, pay the interest on his loan and reinvest in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":996045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

She lives with 43-year old Edgardo who has been her partner for a long time. They have two children, Edgardo aged 14 and Rubi aged 5. They live in their own house. \r\n\r\nLupita works hard every day to provide her family with a better quality of life. She goes to the houses of her friends, neighbours, and relatives to show them the different items of clothing she has for sale. When her customers have won her trust, she lets them buy the items on credit. They make the repayments either daily, weekly, or in some cases every two weeks. Lupita has been doing this work for seven years; she works alone as there is no need for another person to help her.\r\n\r\nShe really enjoys the work as it allows her enough time to be able to work in a state institution where she has a very important role. Selling clothing provides additional income so she can provide a better standard of living for her family.\r\n\r\nLudmila wishes to continue this work but her goal is to have a shop or small business from which to sell her products. This will be her 15th loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that this financial assistance is available to enable her to expand her business.

He is married, and has three children aged five, seven and nine. He has two additional dependents, who live with him to assist with the household chores. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Shek established his compressor, fan, copper wire, dryer and gas business. He started the business after graduating from the technical school. The business deals with cooling systems and accessories. Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,300,000 every month from this business.

In search of an income source for her family, Mamlakatkhon started her own business in animal husbandry in 2004 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), which now yields a stable income from the sales of milk and meat products.  She is also involved in preparing and selling dried fruits and today has a ready inventory of nuts, valued at 70,000 som (KGS).

And this province is also the location of the Juan Santamar\u00eda International Airport, the largest in the country.\r\n\r\nSeveral months ago, Oldemar got a small group of cattle to have greater financial stability, since he is a driver for a business and has been occupied with this work for almost his whole life. But now he needs to get more fully involved with livestock as his four children have begun to study.  Oldemar needs to acquire more cattle to get more profits and thus be able to afford tuition fees for his children, to give them the opportunity to become great professionals.\r\n\r\nAt this point Oldemar is requesting \u20a1 600,000.00 (six hundred thousand colones) to purchase two bulls \"healthy and good looking\" for his cattle, as he tells us.\r\n\r\nOldemar is a member of the Communal Bank Credit Company of San Francisco, one of 150 organizations that EDESA partners with in Costa Rica. Oldemar continues to grow personally and economically in addition to participating actively in the credit organization in his community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":994687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Since 1992 while in search of a source of income for her family Rayakan started her business in breeding livestock. Because of her tenacity and perseverance today her business has one milk cow, two sheep, three goats and brings about 9,000 Som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and dairy products. Rayakan is also engaged in tailoring national products like \"shyrdak\" (a felt mat) and \"toshok\" (blanket) yielding an income of about 4,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to further develop her business Rayakan has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to buy goats.
