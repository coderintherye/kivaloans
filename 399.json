She also sells beer at various events--dances, sports matches, etc.--in the town.  Her husband drives a cab and helps her with the business when needed.  Sra. Maria was elected to be president of the community bank because she is especially responsible and supportive of the others in the group.

Freddy has two young children, not yet in school.  His wife works at home and takes care of the children, so he is the sole provider for the family.  He will use the loan to buy construction materials to enlarge his small house.\r\n\r\nSra. WILMA is the group secretary.  She makes and sells \"polleras\" (a traditional skirt) at her house in Rossasani, an area far from the city and not yet served by public transportation.

He lives with his his partner and has one child under his care. He lives in the community of Palestina, located in the beautiful Cuzco rainforest, where he has his own house. He has been working in agriculture for more than 30 years, growing cacao and coffee. The reason why he entered into this area is that he saw that the vast majority of his competitors didn't produce their agricultural products on a large scale. In addition, the wholesalers who stockpiled the coffee and cacao didn't acknowledge the financial worth of the products. That is why Francisco wants to produce in quantity and in quality, with the goal of selling at a fair price. Today, at 47, he considers himself to have reached one of his goals of becoming a community leader thanks to his constant efforts. Nonetheless, he does not want to rest. That is why he has plans to increase his market in other strategic areas, buying large crop areas. The idea is to minimize cost and time when it comes time to transport and sell his products in the warehouses in the community. This is his third loan with MFP and he is committed to complying with his payment schedule. In addition, he feels supported by his community group because of the committment and responsibility he has with it. With the loan he is asking for he will buy materials and fertilizers to improve his cacao and coffee crops.

Five years later this dream has turned into a reality with his business of selling barbequed chicken, hamburgers and hot dogs. He lives with his wife (at his side in the photograph) and his three children ages 16,17 and 18. His family works with him. Libardos\u2019s business is registered with the Commerce Department under the name \u201cEl Chino and Ceci Fast Food\u201d. The business is located in the Villanueva community near the Barranquilla Market. His business activities happen in two places. Every day he has a booth in the Barranquilla Market from 4:00 AM until 8:00 AM. On the weekends he works on the corner of the street where he lives. Libardo is applying for his second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Institution. With his last loan he was able to buy kitchen tools and fix his house. He is asking for a loan of $2,000,000 in order to buy a pair of cabinets, chairs, tables and ingredients such as salsas and seasonings. Many of his customers, when they come to buy his food, have to stand up to eat it. This influences his sales.\r\nHis dreams are to finish his house. He wants his children to finish high school and continue studying in the university. To achieve these dreams he continues to grow his business. His business is the only family income.

","en":"Ana, 27 years old, is a widow and has a young child. She lives in the jungle of Ayacucho, where she has her own house made of wood. Ana had wanted to study agronomy, but due to her economic situation, she couldn\u2019t finish her secondary studies, and her plans never worked out. She understood that she could not depend on her parents, so she began work as a laborer on her neighbor\u2019s farm. All the money that she earned, she saved up. Now she has her own land to cultivate, produce and sell cacao and coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible\u201d does not exist for her. For this reason, she has already found her niche in the market, generating quite a degree of success for her young age. Her success is due to her early mornings at her farm, to give it needed attention. In general, she works Monday through Saturday, from 5:30am until 6:00pm. Normally, her products are sold at centers in her community. In the future, she plans to put in a grocery store to diversify her market. This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to complete the payments punctually. Also, she is happy with the good decisions that her communal bank makes. Ana plans to invest this money in fertilizers and other consumables, with the goal of improving her cacao and coffee plantations.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":538902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-12T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2061.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449406,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-12T16:45:44Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200084,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es socia del Banco Comunal Fe.\nMaria es casada, tiene 53 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos, Maria vende comida en la puerta de su casa, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas, adem\u00e1s vende ropa en las diferentes ferias de la regi\u00f3n.\nMaria necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1800 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de ropa.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Maria son educar a su hijo y nieto, mejorar su negocio.\n","en":"Maria is a member of the Faith Community Bank.

Her husband is retired from the police department and her daughter is majoring in marketing and sales in the SENA while learning English in an academy.

He lives in a community called Palestina Alta, located in the beautiful jungles of Cusco, and where he has his own home.  Two decades ago, our country experienced a period of social and economic crisis that affected Gerber and led to little income from the sale of his product.  Today, he sells his cacao to the major wholesalers of his locality at competitive prices.  This has greatly helped his income, which continues to increase thanks to his perseverance and tenacity.  He is also dedicated to his children\u2019s education, hoping they will follow in his footsteps and bring new methods and technologies to their line of work.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, he uses farm laborers to work his land, but he also sometimes has the help of his family.

She is a farmer who owns a half-hectare plot of land to cultivate rice to sell to support her family. Her problem is that it is time to plant, but she does not have enough money to start this year's crop. So to improve the production of rice, Mrs. Sok O. is asking for a loan for her farm in order to increase the rice yield this current year. Her husband, Mr. Sambath Mech, is a construction worker.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Emelia A. Group'.\r\n\r\nEmelia is married and has 3 children. To make a living, Emelia owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from catching and selling fresh-water fish at the market. Emelia has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelia is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Emelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He works hard to manage the financial expenses of its family. By going to milk shops for purchasing milk, it affects his earnings. Therefore, Khalida has decided to apply for a loan from Asasah to purchase a dairy cow. This will allow her husband to get the milk directly from the cow and sell it to the required customers.

Th\u1ecb (87) is a 47-year-old female living in the town of Thanh H\u00f3a.  T\u00ecnh is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 040-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.03.040).\r\n\r\n\r\nT\u00ecnh is married and has two adult aged children.  To make a living, T\u00ecnh owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale.  T\u00ecnh has been engaged in this business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, T\u00ecnh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T\u00ecnh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 4,248,000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Tinh from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  T\u00ecnh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  H. Th\u1ecb Chi\u00eau (84) is a 26-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  N. Th\u1ecb Minh (86) is a 37-year-old female who is requesting a 4,248,000 VND loan to support her business making & selling food.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT\u00ecnh P.

Yen is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 03-\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16-04-03 \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i).\r\n\r\n\r\nYen is married and has one infant child.  To make a living, Yen operates a family member's business harvesting & selling river-caught fish in the local community.  Yen has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,700,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Yen joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Yen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,963,500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She is now requesting a new loan of 3,079,800 VND, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by Yen from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Yen plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Vu Thi Nhung (3) is a 29-year-old female who is requesting a 3,079,800 VND loan to support her fishing business.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Do Thi Van (73) is a 20-year-old female who is requesting a 3,079,000 VND loan to support her business raising livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Nguyen Thi Du (1) is a 46-year-old female who is requesting a 3,079,800 VND loan to support her fishing business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nYen Nguyen Thi (6) l\u00e0 23 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

He works from 5pm-10pm each evening, selling to commuters during the busy evening rush hour.  This is Imanuel's first loan from Tujijenge Tanzania, and he will use it to increase his stock of nuts.

M. was born in the province of Gaza in the south of Mozambique. She is 27 years old, married, and has a 12-year-old son who attends school. Sonia only studied through 5th grade, and didn't continue because of her parents\u2019 lack of financial resources. She lives with her family in their own house and doesn\u2019t help support anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nShe left Gaza for the Boane district of Maputo with her parents when she was still quite young. She has owned her own business for more than 5 years. She doesn\u2019t employ any help and has a monthly income of around 9000 Meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and occasionally saves some in her bank account as well.\r\n\r\nSonia has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, bars, blocks, iron and other items) in order to continue working on the construction of her home. Her earlier loan was for 5000 Meticais and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish her house and offer her family better living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

He has worked for more than 10 years for the Ministry of Education as a teacher. He doesn\u2019t employ any help and has a monthly salary of 5886 Meticais. He uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some each month in his bank account.\r\n\r\nAntonio has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through colleagues who also work with the institution. This is his 2nd loan, for the amount of 12,000 Meticais. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, bars, blocks, iron and other items) in order to continue working on the construction of his home. His earlier loan was for 10,000 Meticais and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to start a business and finish his house, in order to offer his family better living conditions. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

She is 39 years old, married, and has 5 children who are 20, 17, 13, 10 and 6 years old. All of the children attend school. Amelia only studied through 9th grade, and didn't continue because she married at a young age. She lives with her family in their own house and helps support two nephews who live with them.\r\n\r\nShe continues to live in Boane, where she has worked in the Agricultural Institute for 6 years. She employs one person to help her with cooking and housework. She has a monthly salary of 2200 Meticais, which she uses to cover household expenses. With the help of her husband and his salary, she also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nAmelia has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through colleagues who also work with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 12,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, zinc plates, beams, sand, stone and other items) in order to expand her home. Her earlier loan was for 6000 Meticais and was used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish working on her house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

M. was born in the city of Maputo, in the province of the same name in the south of Mozambique. She is 40 years old, married, and has a 17-year-old son who is in school. She only studied through 4th grade, and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. She lives with her family in their own house and she helps support a niece who lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe never left Maputo, but moved to a new neighborhood when she got married. She has owned her own business for more than 20 years and has two employees who help her. She earns a monthly income of around 8000 Meticais, and she uses this money to cover household expenses. She also saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nGilda has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy a variety of new and used clothing in order to increase her stock of merchandise. Her earlier loan was for 10,000 Meticais and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

M. was born in the city of Maputo, in the province of the same name in the south of Mozambique. She is 42 years old, unmarried, and has 2 children who are 22 and 9 years old. Both attend school.  Albertina only studied through 8th grade, and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. She lives with her children in their own house and doesn\u2019t help support anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nShe never left Maputo, but moved to a new neighborhood when she built her own home. She has owned her own business for more than 5 years and doesn\u2019t employ any help. She earns a monthly income of almost 10,000 Meticais, and she uses this money to cover household expenses. She also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nAlbertina has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000 Meticais. She plans to use this money to buy products (beer, soft drinks, rice, eggs and other items) in order to increase her stock of merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to purchase more goods to improve her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

She is 45 years old, married, and has two children, ages 17 and 14.  Both children go to school.  Maria only finished fifth grade and did not continue school because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and from time to time sends her mother some money to help with food costs.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, she and her husband left Xai-Xai to go to Boane for a work transfer.  Her husband currently works in the mines in South Africa and sometimes sends money to help with household expenses.  Maria is a businesswoman and has run her own business for more than 25 years.  She has no employees and earns about 4,500 meticais per month.  Maria uses the money for household expenses and saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has taken out loans before from Tchuma Credit Union and decided not to continue with them.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends and relatives who are also customers of this institution.  This is Maria's third loan.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy capulanas (a traditional Mozambican skirt), so she can increase her stock.  The earlier loans were both for 10,000 meticais and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nMaria promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.  Her dream is to have a nice shop to keep all her merchandise in.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans in order to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

is 32 years old, married, and lives with his wife and four children. He has been a farmer for the past five years. He began farming with the goal of supporting his household, and above all, satisfying the needs of his children. For Mardonali, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the production in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take them away themselves. Now Mardonali wishes to borrow money that he wants to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. Be an important part of the growth of Mardonali\u2019s business. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Armindo only finished seventh grade.  He did not continue school because he was drafted into military service.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports two step-children who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left Zamb\u00e9zia to go to Boane while performing his military service.  Later on, he made his home and started his family here.  For more than eight years he has run his own business, with the help of his niece and a sister-in-law.  He earns about 7,500 meticais per month and receives a military pension of 3,200 meticais per month.  He uses this money for household expenses and also saves some in his bank account at Millenium Bim.\r\n\r\nArmindo has never taken out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through a military colleague who is also a customer of this institution.  This is Armindo's fourth loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy products (rice, chicken, meat, eggs, oil and other foods) to diversify the types of meals he prepares for his customers.  The previous loans were for 10,000 meticais, 19,000 meticais, and 21,000 meticais.  They were used for housing and business.\r\n\r\nArmindo promises to pay off this loan on time so he may have more loans.  In the future, he would like to ask for more loans to improve his shop and make his business grow more.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Ghandi has owned a bakery. For 20 years, Ghandi has been selling \u201csaj\u201d bread and Lebanese pastries. A saj is the metal oven used to make saj bread; it is a traditional Lebanese cooking dome. The saj is used to make several types of bread, including markouk (thinned) bread and doughy confections, or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza; the most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it any time of the day, but it somehow tastes better in the morning. He produces different types of jams, spices, bread and more. He also does Lebanese pastries like \u201cFatayers\u201d, which are spiced triangular spinach pies stuffed with meat and onions; \u201cSfiha\u201d which are pies made from our own fresh dough topped with spicy ground lamb meat, onions and tomatoes; \u201cSambousik\u201d which are pastries with meat and pine nuts; and \u201cRakaek Jibne\u201d which are thin flour dough, stuffed with a combination of cheese and fried to golden perfection. Ghandi requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to rehabilitate his oven and install an electricity meter for his business. This is the first time that he has requested a loan. He is special in his work because he offers good quality and very tasty pastries and mankoucheh. His clients are people from his region, but mainly his friends, neighbors and tourists. Ghandi decided on doing his business because he is a very good cook and has experience. He plans to keep on expanding his business as well as his financial situation.

Ahmad specializes in croissants: flaky crescent-shaped bread roll made of a yeast dough similar to puff pastry, which can be either plain or sweet, such as a chocolate croissant. In Lebanon people also eat savoury croissants with zaatar (thyme) and jebneh (cheese). One can eat these croissant varieties anytime of the day, but somehow they taste better in the morning. The best time to eat a croissant is when it just went out of the oven when it is still hot, then it simply tastes great. Ahmad is a croissant specialist because he is known for his good and tasty croissants. He started his business a year ago when he realized that there is great demand for a baker in his region, especially since there is a school next to his bakery. Because he is well located, he has a broad customer base including friends, neighbors, passer bys and school children. Ahmad requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase an oven and also a motorcycle for his bakery. The motorcycle will allow him to do home deliveries and increase his customers base. This is the first time that Ahmad has requested a loan from Al Majmoua. Ahmad decided on this business because he always wanted to open a bakery on his own, after working in the same field and gaining some experience. In the future, he plans on expanding his

She lives in an area located in the Ayacuchana jungle, where she has her own house.\r\n\r\nEver since she was young, Juan has been carrying sacks of cacao.  Even though this is work for men, she has never been embarrassed.  With her characteristic energy she decided to engage in farming, the production and sale of cacao.\r\n\r\nShe has always respected the quality of her product.  That is why she has potential buyers.  The way she works is a consequence of much dedication to the land with her crops.  She works 12 hours a day, and she only rests on Sundays.\r\n\r\nShe generally works with her children, but sometimes she has the help of laborers during harvest time.  She normally sells her products in the centers where people gather in her area.  Juana recognizes that there is much to do.  That is why she plans to buy more land in the future.  She will produce other products like coffee and citrus fruits in order to be able to diversify her portfolio of customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She assures us that she will faithfully repay the loan like she did with her previous payments.  She is grateful to her communal bank for the transparency in which it works.  Juana will use the money she is requesting to buy supplies and fertilizer to provide adequate maintenance to her cacao crops.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":539278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizer and supplies for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-12T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3055.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449409,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-13T04:35:47Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":200306,"name":"Eligio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" El se\u00f1or Eligio, es propietario de una despensa y copet\u00edn(venta de comestibles y bebidas) en su propio domicilio, el es una persona muy trabajadora que lucha con toda su familia, para salir adelante de la mejor manera posible.\nEl negocio que el posee se encuentra bien surtida con todos los productos de consumo familiar, y es atendida generalmente por la esposa ya que el tambi\u00e9n se dedica a otras actividades como la agricultura.\nEl negocio se abri\u00f3 en el 2005 y actualmente cuenta con una clientela formada que la conforman especialmente los vecinos.\nSolicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar fideos, arroz, harina, l\u00e1cteos, panificados, aceite,  para surtir mas su negocio y as\u00ed poder satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes.

In the past, aid has come from her family and her husband.  With a loan, she opened her store some 7 years ago.

She has separated from her partner because he abused her. Norma received a loan of PEN 500 for salt and small animals for her business. Ever since she was a little girl Norma has worked and built up savings by buying and selling small animals to her neighbors. Norma is expecting her business and life to change significantly as she progresses as a member of FINCA and gets the chance to learn how to save her money, take care of her community, and attend various training sessions offered. Norma is dreaming of having a large guinea pig farm someday.\r\n\r\nSilvia is married and has two children who are also eight and two years old. Silvia was granted a loan of PEN 200 to use for her business, selling grains and small animals. Silvia has suffered greatly since childhood, becoming an orphan at the young age of eight. She bought grains to start a business and move forward and decided to join FINCA to learn to save her money and because she likes the training sessions and workshops. Silvia expects that her life will change as a member of FINCA and that she will learn to appreciate herself as a woman. Silvia dreams of owning a small grocery store.\r\n\r\nMarisol is married and has three children who are two months, four and six years old. She has struggled since the father of her children abandoned them. She used her PEN 200 loan to purchase more chickens for her business. Marisol is grateful to FINCA because she will now have life insurance (FINCA Vida) and will have more capital for her business. Marisol is excited to learn how to save her money and invest it in her business.

She lives in her own home, in a town located in the beautiful Ayacuchana jungle.  She knows very well that she has few economic resources and that she only uses them to pay for necessities.  She also had a small plot of land, on which she cultivated cocoa, but her sales of cocoa did not generate a good income.  Now she has a plot where she cultivates cocoa and coffee in large quantities, and she also has a good number of customers among those she works with.  For this reason, she is satisfied with her work.  She has been working steadily for 39 years with good results; to achieve this, she always had the help of her children, and occasionally the help of farm workers, at harvest time.  She normally works from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening.  Generally, she sells her products at the street market of her community.  Nevertheless, for the future, she yearns to expand her cultivated land with the goal of satisfying her customers.

Everyday from 5:30am, their two young helpers and their two youngest children go around delivering bread to neighbourhood stores and homes. Then their two children set off for school. Gregoria also sells bread in the mornings from the corner near her house.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in the past with Kiva and is very grateful to the staff who assisted her with the business which finally began to do well and she was able to hire two young people to help out.

From a very early age she wanted to be independent and currently helps her parents plant and harvest efficiently.  She produces cocoa beans and coca leaves to sell and has gradually been improving her sales.  She owes all this to her parents who taught her the skills and gave her the tools to be an efficient farmer.\r\n\r\nRosa realizes that there are many things still to improve both with respect to quality and to quantity and she will achieve this as time passes; it\u2019s only the lack of funds that keeps her from introducing mechanization that would allow for large scale production.\r\n\r\nGenerally she works alone but occasionally her family helps her; she always needs help from field hands during harvest time, however.  She works a 12-hour day with just Sundays off to spend with her family.  Her future plan is to produce citrus fruit in order to acquire more customers and have an \r\nedge over her competition.\r\n\r\nThis is her 2nd loan with MFP and she assures prompt repayment.

They live in the city of Cuenca which Ecuadorians consider the most beautiful city in the coutry. One of its attractions is the beautiful artisan crafts that are found throughout the city, from embroidered blouses, wool sweaters, gold and sliver plated filigree jewelry to weavings. Cuenca also has a tradition of producing ceramic items, artisan crafts and fresh produce that can be found in the market on Thursdays or in the (smaller) market on Saturdays. One industry leader in Cuenca and its surrounding towns is the production of toquilla straw hats. \r\n\r\n Mar\u00eda de Lourdes G. lives in the city of Cuenca. She is a very cheerful member who radiates a lot of charisma, is in her second cycle and is one of the founders of this little bank. She is very eager to grow her businesses.  \r\n\r\nShe is a 30 year old woman and she has been separated from her husband for 5 months. Her marriage produced four children aged 11,8,7, and 4. Her three oldest children are studying in the local elementary school and since they don't own their own home they are renting. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda took up the business of selling Yanbal products again 4 years ago. She has sold these products since she was 18 years old. She also works Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in a a beauty salon. She learned this skill on her own. With the new loan, she will purchase creams, treatments, makeup, perfume, and costume jewelry from Yanbal.   \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own beauty salon. \r\n\r\n Ver\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda is 29 years old ans she is another active member of this bank. She lives in the city of Cuenca with her four children aged 11,7,6, and 4 in a little rented house. Her three oldest children are in an elementary school in the city and the youngest stays with her. She tells us that she does not receive any help from the childrens' father and so she must get them ahead on her own.   \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica has been selling catalog clothing for a year and she also promotes various products in the stores and supermarkets in the city when acquaintances call her to do this work. She has been doing this activity for 10 years.   \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with her communal bank and she is very hopeful to get ahead with her children. With her loan she will purchase pants, sweatsuits, blouses, jackets and more clothing to continue progressing in her business.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated

She resides in a community located in the Cuzque\u00f1a jungle, where she has her own home.  She grew up in this community, only a few steps from the river.  Her parents are farmers, and she has always helped them in their home and at their garden.  She started to become independent at age 17, and therefore her parents gave her a plot of land to cultivate, but she wanted to change to another line of work.  She now runs a grocery store, with much success.  She begins work each day at 6 in the morning and works until 9 at night, attending to the needs of her customers.  She generally works with her husband, but often is alone in charge of the business.  In the future, she wishes to expand her grocery store with the goal of selling at wholesale and retail.

He lives in a community in the Cusco backcountry where he owns his house.\r\n\r\nNazario remembers that when he was young he made some mistakes as a farmer because he would sell his crops for too low a price and only earned enough income to subsist.  However, this experience served him well because he learned how to buy at market prices.

She also says FMSD allowed her to get out of a job that was damaging to her health and work independently.  In addition, she believes that the organization gives financial access to good clients like her who cannot afford to conduct business in cash but have opportunities to take advantage of sales promotions for products offered in the catalogs.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to finish her house, which is in the advanced stages of construction, and make it more habitable.  She hopes to spend time with her family because she currently lives at her parents\u2019 house.

She is 54 years old. Teresita is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTeresita is married and has 9 school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns & operates a business venture in the food sector selling a variety of vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from vegetable vending. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Nabbotuan, Solana, Cagayan.

Emelson has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 75,000 Philippine pesos per harvest. Emelson said that his business really helps his family financially, thus he is very determined to continuously manage the said activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Emelson joined ASKI, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelson has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. \r\n\r\nEmelson is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Emelson from ASKI.

Hajarah doesn\u2019t have any other side business. Hajarah has been in this business for two  years and with MCDT for seven years. Her business challenges include transportation, thievesand ever increasing prices of cattle.  She is aspiring of owning a delivery van.
