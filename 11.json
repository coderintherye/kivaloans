She has four children, and , together with her younger sister, also takes care of her aging mother. \r\n\r\nShe also has two grandchildren whom she supports, since her daughter, their mother, does not have any means to earn an income. Monica lives in the Kayole area of Nairobi, which is an informal settlement where many poor people reside. Since she is the Pastor's wife, she also assists her husband to take care of some of the church members who are in dire need.\r\n\r\nMonica has been doing salon work including hair and beauty for about 20 years. She started off her small salon and training business in 2004, with money that she received through a merry go round group that she was involved in. She used the money  to buy a hair drier, a few seats, a mirror, and some hair chemicals.\r\n\r\nSince 2006, Monica has been receiving short contracts to train students in need coming from the Kayole area, who are sponsored to learn vocational skills by the World Vision Organization. However, Monica has been experiencing problems.  First, she only has seven seats and 15 students. Second, she only has one hair drier and the students have to wait for long periods. She sometimes even loses clients to other salons because they have to wait for very long periods.\r\n\r\nMonica is a member of the Kisima group of Action Now Kenya within the Kayole area, and she has so far received a loan of $57, which she used to purchase required chemicals and beauty products for her business.\r\n\r\nMonica now seeks a loan of $500, whose repayment period will be between 12 - 18 months. Monica would purchase 10 seats, 2 blow driers, one hair drier and one training dummy. This support would go a long way in enabling her to provide faster services to her clients hence save much of their time, and her students would also have a more comfortable learning atmosphere. She also hopes that once she completes this loan repayment, she can receive an additional loan that she will use to buy other additional equipment that her business requires."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":16788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To

The majority of families rely heavily on their land and selling their produce to earn a living. Faaasu grew up on a plantation and now grows and sells bananas. Her business is successful because she supplies several markets. She sells once a week at the local market. Her price varies according to the number of banana sellers at the market. When there are many banana sellers, she reduces her price. But when there are few sellers and high demand, she can charge more.

R. has been a farmer and a cattle rancher in Salitre his whole life. Although he only has a primary education, he has been able to be successful in cattle ranching and rice cultivation. After working in his father's ranch as a young man, he decided to acquire his own land and start his own family. He has 8 children ages 20, 18, 17, 16, 14, 7, 5 and 1. His older children have already finished their studies and work with him on the ranch while his other kids are still in school. Along with rice cultivation he will also make some investment in cattle with the loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount that is missing. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":17103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Invest in cattle and prepare his lands for rice cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-02T01:49:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-17T19:01:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:44:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19613,"comment":"1 er pago de asociacion resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:44:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19614,"comment":"2do pago de asociaci\u00f3n resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:59:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26604,"comment":"3er pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:02:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36151,"comment":"4to pago asoc resisencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:28:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47476,"comment":"5to pago resistencia"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59569,"comment":"6to pago asoc resistencia"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-03T20:01:17Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:19:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":5318,"name":"Colon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Colon Dumes is a rancher and farmer from a rural town in Ecuador named Salitre.

Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":18412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Rice farming and Cattle Ranching","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-02T01:49:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Colon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-17T22:37:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T14:56:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13838,"comment":"Primer pago "},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:38:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19610,"comment":"2do pago de asociaci\u00f3n resistencia de salitre"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:55:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26600,"comment":"3er pago asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T22:18:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35707,"comment":"pago de 4ta cuota asoc resistencia"},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:26:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47473,"comment":"5to pago resistencia"},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59565,"comment":"6to pago asoc resistencia"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-03T23:37:01Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":5319,"name":"Kwarteng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Ghana, kente is a traditional cloth used for every occasion.

She used to work at store that sold electrical appliances, but she had to quit because her daughters were being left at the care of another person. She quit once she separated from the father of her daughters because he left her, and with the money she had saved and a loan, Johanna was able to set up a business to sell fast food. She has been running this business for 6 months now, and opens it from 5:00 pm to to 12:00 am. Her sister helps her.\r\n\r\n<p>Johanna wishes to get the loan so that she can adapt her home for the business since she is renting the place where it is located now, and that generates an extra expense.

Ilkhom is 31 years old and is married with two sons. He has a University degree and is very proud of that. He has studied at the faculty of finance and credit. His dream was always to work in a bank. But it is complicated to find a high payable job in Tajikistan, especially in rural regions. Ilkhom decided to use his own vehicle as a taxi. His vehicle was old and always was out for maintenance. He had the skills for maintenance but the spare parts were expensive and he did not have enough funds. That is why he applied to MicroInvest for his first loan. After receiving his loan he repaired his own vehicle and helped some other people he knew in repairing their vehicles. By now he became a very good repairman and number of his clients have increased.

is happily married with two sons. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Vitalyi had a hard time finding a job. In 1992 he decided to start his own small business selling video tapes which was quite popular in post-Soviet Ukraine at the time. His persistence and determination helped him stay in the saddle through tough economic times. Later, Vitalyi decided to change his area of business and began selling office supplies. This business has been the only source of income for his family since the late 1990\u2019s. Currently, Vitalyi sees about $800 in net profit every month. \r\n\r\nVitalyi is very responsible. He has promptly repaid all loans he has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Financial assistance has not only helped him to grow his business selling CDs, notebooks, greeting cards, paper, markers, and children\u2019s literature, but it has also enabled him to expand into a new area. Recently Vitalyi opened a new store selling household chemical items in one of the local malls in Berdyansk. \r\n\r\nHe would like to get a loan of $1,200 to increase his inventory of household chemical products in the second store. He is planning to purchase a variety of laundry soaps, shampoos, cleaners, solvent-free furniture polish, air fresheners and other consumer products. The loan will give Vitalyi necessary capital to purchase this inventory and increase his sales and profits. Funds generated will allow him to continue to expand his business and will give him the opportunity to provide for and improve the living conditions for his family which he believes is his first priority in life.     \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412\u0456\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0439 - \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0432 \u043d\u044c\u043e\u0433\u043e

Convenient locations and bright advertising signs attract many potential customers to his stores. Presently, Sergey makes about $1,000 net profit per month.  \r\n\r\nSergey is hard-working and focused. He has invested a lot of energy, money and effort into his business. He is very flexible and closely follows trends in the fast changing auto business. This allows him to best serve his customers\u2019 needs and helps to boost his sales. Sergey is also very optimistic and can handle challenging situations. Not long ago he underwent a serious surgery. However, he didn\u2019t let it affect his business. On the contrary, strategic thinking and good decision making helped Sergey increase his sales and generate additional profit. \r\n\r\nSergey is requesting a loan of $1,200 to increase his supply of lube oils and auto accessories. He would like to expand his business and is planning to hire more sales staff. This will provide a good income for one or two more families in the community. Sergey is a businessman who sets high goals and knows how to achieve them.

She is married, and has five children. Having never gone to school, she is illiterate. Monica started her business of selling boiled maize in 2004. She boils and sells the maize at a garage near the Kiambiu slums, where she and her family resides. \r\n\r\nInitially, she did casual labour where she would do laundry for people in the surrounding estates near the slums. It is with income from this laundry work that she saved up some capital to start over her business. Monica is now a member of the Vumilia Women Group of Action Now Kenya, and so far, she has received a loan of $57, which she used to revive her maize boiling business through purchase of stock, and has successfully repaid. She has also has received a loan of $ 85 that she used to pay school fees for her children. She is still making repayments for this loan. \r\n\r\nMonica has been experiencing some difficulties in her business, since she only has a small sufuria (cooking pot), which she uses to boil maize. The small sufuria forces her to boil the maize in two or three batches, in order to satisfy her customers. Many times however, she runs out of time while trying to boil the second or third round of maize, when the customers are out on a brief lunch break. She therefore asks them to wait till the next batch is ready.  Because they have a short lunch brunch, many customers are forced to get food from other places, or to go back to work hungry if they can\u2019t afford food that is more costly. This means therefore that often times, Monica only manages to sell the first batch of maize that is ready on time, and is left with the second batch of cooked maize that she is forced to carry back home. This ends up as a loss to her small business.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan of $75, which she will receive in kind, Monica will purchase a big sufuria (cooking pot) and a jiko (cooking stove). The new additions to her business will enable her to boil more maize on the go, hence manage to sell all the stock for the day. This will also ensure that her customers get enough maize over their brief lunch break, hence they don\u2019t have to spend more money for lunch, or go back to work while still hungry. In return, Monica will now get a higher income that will enable her to support her family, and take her children to school. The repayment period for her loan will be between 8 \u2013 15 months.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":17417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of a big sufuria (cooking pot) and a jiko (cooking stove).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambiu Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-06T22:16:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-20T22:36:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":9.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:17:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24150,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:18:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33365,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:18:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44085,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:18:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56064,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:19:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69032,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:20:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83163,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":5,"local_amount":5,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98856,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-06T23:36:04Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":5416,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chritine is a 46 year old single mother with two children aged 18 and 22.

He is married and has two wives, one living with him in Kibera, and the other living with his aging mother back in his home village in Busia District, in the Western Province of Kenya. In total Charles has 11 children, two of which with his first wife, now deceased. Three of his children - all daughters - are married, but the other 8 children, together with his wives and his mother all depend on him.\r\n\r\nCharles started his hotel in 1999, after he got some savings money from his grocery shop, still in Kibera. He did this in order to diversify his business, and he has continued to run both businesses since. He works together with his wife in this business, and has also employed two employees to assist with the workload. Some of the favorite foods that he serves in his hotel include mandazi (similar to doughnuts), chapatti (a kind of unleavened bread made from wheat flour), beef stew, fish, ugali (A paste made from a mixture of maize meal and water), beans and githeri (made from a mixture of maize and beans boiled together then fried). Charles is a member of the Agape group of Action Now Kenya, within the Kibera slums, and has so far received loans of $57 and $85, which he used to buy stock for his hotel. Charles also received $115 from his group, which he used to buy 2 bags of cement and sand to plaster the walls of the hotel for better presentation. Charles has also been trained by ANK on living with HIV\/AIDS, and has learnt about small business management and operation, together with loan management. \r\n\r\nGiven the loan of $225, which is repayable within a period of 8 \u2013 14 months, Charles intends to completely refurbish his hotel by fabricating a new set of chairs and tables which will be designed to save space through the sitting arrangement. This will be the first phase where two tables, with six seats each, will be fabricated. Once the loan is repaid, he intends to borrow an additional loan to make another two tables, to ensure that he has a sitting capacity of 24 people at any one time. Currently his hotel can only sit about 10 customers, yet he feels that there is space to accommodate more people. Through this support, Charles will be assured of additional income, due to the extra business created through the sitting arrangement in the hotel. Charles also hopes that in future as the business continues to expand, his hotel will create additional job opportunities for more people within the Kibera slums. He also intends in future on expanding by buying a television set and video machine, through which to attract more customers, and to also provide some educational information for his customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":17420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of furniture to refurbish the hotel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-05T00:37:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-19T04:11:51Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":225,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":58,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:17:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24151,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:18:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33366,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:18:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44086,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:18:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56065,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:19:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69033,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:20:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83164,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98857,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-05T05:11:51Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T10:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":12,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":5422,"name":"Firudin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Firudin M. owns a small gas station in the town of Khachmaz located in the North Eastern part of Azerbaijan.

She has lived in one of the slums of Kisumu, Kenya, for the past thirteen years. She is a widow and heads a household of five school-aged children, two of whom are orphans due to AIDS. She was trained by UNICEF as a community health worker in 1993. In 1997, she received training from KMET for home-based HIV\/AIDS care, TB ambassadorship, and community-based distribution of oral contraceptives. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence is very well-known within her community for her compassionate work and also as a politician. She is the women\u2019s representative for the Liberal Democratic Party in Kisumu District, where her principal role is to speak to women, raise awareness, and encourage their involvement in the political process to fight for their rights. As an expert in the art of making traditional baskets, Florence initiated a basket-weaving income-generating project for a group of women within her community five years ago, and she continues to lead and support this group. Her main business and source of income, however, is her community pharmacy which she has managed for the past eight years. \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to her reputation and the location of her pharmacy within the community, her business has flourished.

is married and has an 8-year-old son. His father, elder brother and father-in-law are all taxi drivers so he decided to follow in their footsteps and become a taxi driver as well. His transportation business is the only source of income for his family.\r\nVladimir is very responsible and modest and has a good reputation among other taxi drivers. He has promptly repaid each of the 11 loans he has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. The loans have enabled him to change his vehicle 9 times in the 10-year period that he has been in business. He purchased his first car for $3,000. The last car he purchased cost $15,000. He uses an economical, diesel vehicle for his taxi and after fuel costs, he is able to bring in around $40-$50 in daily profit. Having a flexible schedule and being willing to provide transportation services all over Ukraine and to other parts of Europe have helped Vladimir get many loyal clients.  \r\nVladimir is requesting a loan of $800 to help purchase a more comfortable and reliable car. He is planning to sell his current vehicle and buy a newer Mercedes 124\/300 D that is highly rated for comfort, reliability, performance, and value. A newer car will give Vladimir the opportunity to travel to other destinations, change some of his regular itineraries and expand his business. Not only will this help his business but it will also give his family a better quality of life. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u2013

is married with two sons. In addition to her immediate family, she also takes care of her mother and father-in-law and her nephew who lives with them. Nataliya started her business because there was no other means to sustain her family. Today she runs a couple of kiosks selling bedding and knitted wear for children in the central city market. She has been in this trade for ten years. Currently, she has around $2,500 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $1,200. \r\n\r\nNataliya is very cheerful and friendly. Her first goal is to please her customers, which has added a lot to the success of her business. Nataliya\u2019s reasonable pricing policy helps her keep loyal clients and attract new customers. The nineteen loans she has received and repaid from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also had a big part in the growth of her business. Not long ago Nataliya was able to purchase another vending kiosk and hire a person to help her with sales. \r\n\r\nNataliya is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase bed sets for children from a wholesaler. She is planning to double her assortment of inventory with warm blankets, linen sheets, pillow cases, and diapers that she can purchase in bulk. Nataliya has a couple of goals in mind for her added sales income. First, she would like to assist her nephew with his college tuition. Secondly, she is planning to use part of the income to open two new vending kiosks to sell flower seeds, plants and fertilizers during the spring season. Gardening has always been a hobby of Nataliya\u2019s and she would like to use her knowledge and skills in this area for a new business startup. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044f

is married with a teenage son. He is the only breadwinner in his family. A couple of years ago, Nikolai started a small business selling souvenirs and gifts. The business was not able to provide sufficient income to support his family, however, so Nikolai decided to try something different. Today he runs a small real estate consulting agency providing information about real estate market rates, mortgages, lending conditions and trends in the community. Nikolai has been in this business for about one year and makes around $1,000-1,500 in monthly income.\r\n\r\nNikolai is very cheerful and client-friendly. His natural ability to make every customer feel welcome and his willingness to best serve his clients\u2019 needs have ensured the success of his small business. One of Nikolai\u2019s partners is a local construction company. Cooperation with this company helps him stay informed on the latest developments in the real estate market and get many new clients as a result. Nikolai has repaid four loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d which have helped to stabilize and grow his business.\r\n\r\nHe would like to get a loan for $600 to print advertising leaflets for his consulting agency and to give him some additional capital for small expenses. This loan will help him promote his services and give him the opportunity to help many more people purchase homes or find good building lots for the construction of their homes. Financial assistance will give Nikolai\u2019s business the economic boost it needs to continue to meet the needs of his customers. Nikolai is hoping that one day his hard work and determination will pay off and help him fulfill his ambitious dream of earning $1,000,000. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430

is married with one daughter. After finishing his schooling he rented a small facility and started a business selling cell phones and related accessories. Later he added a selection of digital cameras which he beautifully displayed in his store along with the cell phones. Reasonable prices, an attractively designed store and customer-friendly service contributed to consistent growth in Andrei\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nAndrei\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit was not content to sit back however. Four years ago he decided to start a second business selling groceries. His determination and persistent work have helped him to succeed in this new area of business. Using skills and experience gained in his first business venture, Andrei has established a loyal client base attracted by his polite manner and willingness to best serve their needs. In building his business Andrei has benefited from the availability of funds through \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. He has maintained a perfect credit history, paying every loan back with no delinquencies.\r\n\r\nAndrei is requesting a loan of $700 to purchase food products for his grocery store. He\u2019d like to increase his turnover capital which will allow him to buy additional merchandise and expand his second business. The ability to purchase large amounts of fresh foods and good quality grocery items will help Andrei meet the strong demand for these products. Increased business income will generate the necessary funds to meet his family\u2019s needs and continue to grow his business. \r\n \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0456\u0439 \u2013

is married with two grown children. Two years ago she was facing some serious challenges with her clothing sales business. Low sales rates, few customers, and an inconvenient location for her vending kiosk all contributed to poor performance. However, Anna didn\u2019t give up. After hearing about lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d she decided to get a loan and move into a new area of business. \r\n\r\nToday, Anna runs three kiosks selling clothing, bed linens, towels, terrycloth fabric, textiles, etc. Her daughter is actively involved in the business, helping her mom with sales. Anna has proven to be a hard-working, dedicated entrepreneur and runs her business with integrity and innovation.

is married with a teenage son. In post-Soviet times many families in Ukraine struggled to meet their basic needs. Tatyana\u2019s family was no exception. She decided to start her own business selling groceries to help provide for her family during those tough times. \r\n\r\nSome of the first loans Tatyana received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d were very small. She was able to maintain a perfect credit history and gradually could borrow greater amounts as her business grew. With time her hard work and determination paid off and Tatyana began to witness rapid growth in sales and the expansion of her business. Eventually she was able to open a new kiosk selling clothing and women\u2019s lingerie and hired people to help her with sales. Currently, Tatyana has about $1,200 in monthly net profit.  \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan of $1,200 to buy more stock to sell in her women\u2019s clothing and lingerie store. She would like to purchase assorted sweaters, skirts, blouses, and good quality underwear to meet growing demand from her customers. The loan will help Tatyana strengthen her trade activities and provide necessary resources for her business and family.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n \r\n\u0422\u0435\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u2013
